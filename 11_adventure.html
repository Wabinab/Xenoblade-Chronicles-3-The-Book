<p>Next morning, after they woke up. Lanz, Eunie and Sena were stretching. Riku was helping Manana with folding up her sleeping bag while she watched. Mio was observing Taion by the table. Then, she turned her attention to Noah, whom was checking his iris. On his copper-tinted screen, he was scrolling through some soldier's information. One of them looked like the guy following behind Ethel, another one never saw before.</p>
<p>She walked up to him, prompted, "Looking at something?"</p>
<p>His eyes still focused on his screen, "Oh, nothing in particular, really. It's just kind of a habit. Checking our status, the war... Watching for info updates..." Laughing at himself, "Silly... I don't know why I still bother to check it any more. Not like there'd be updates..." Then, with his iris activated, he turned and meet her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah" With Mio filling his screen, her outline was glowing orange, to which he never seen before. As he glanced upwards to the top of her head, an orange{{footnote: The color isn't exactly orange, but something like copper orange; but just to make things easy, we'll just say orange without mentioning its shade.}} symbol that resembles Mio's blade came into existence. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"An icon just popped up -- over your head."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She activated her iris to check if she sees the same. Glancing over his head, "Oh yeah. Now I can see an icon for you as well." She saw an orange icon that resembled Noah's blade.</p>
<p>"When did we unlock a feature like this? I've never noticed it before." Evoked by their conversation, others formed a circle with them. Noah turned his head to face Taion and Sena. On Taion's head, a symbol with an "8" outline; on Sena's a hammer. Both were blood red. Switching attention to Lanz and Eunie, Lanz had his broadsword, Eunie her rifle-staff. Both were also blood red.</p>
<p>Glancing back at Mio's, "Yours seems to be... the only one not locked."</p>
<p>He tried clicking on it. Mio wasn't checking on her iris by now. She was galvanized, seeing before her eyes his outer jacket turned into one mirroring hers.</p>
<p>"Huh!" Having shocked, she drew a step backward. Noah scanned his new clothing, "Wha-?" (in a high tone)</p>
<p>Manana and the others weren't less surprised, "Ohoho-"</p>
<p>Eunie: "He's lit up like a sparkin' lightbulb!"</p>
<p>Noah reactivated his iris to check for more information. "I guess there must still... be more to this feature." He tried summoning his blades. Two rings appeared on both his hands, Mio's blade.</p>
<p>Sena exclaimed, "Hey, that's Mimi's!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "What in the blazes...?"</p>
<p>As he closed his eyes, his "soul" was practicing moves with the new blade in the yellow-cloud space, like those he was in when he transformed to Ouroboros the other day. "I've never used this kind of Blade before, but all the techniques I can use with it are flashing before my eyes."</p>
<p>Mio was eager to try, her smooth silver jacket replaced with one flurry dark red. Then, she withdrew Noah's blade. Closing her eyes, she saw what Noah meant. "It's so weird... Not like... we suddenly just gained the knowledge out of the blue. But... as if it were always ingrained deep within us. Strange..."</p>
<p>Sena eyed on Mio while she activated her iris, yet was blood red.  "Aww, doesn't look like I can get Mimi's gear. Now that's a shame..." As she looked, Noah and Mio sheathed their blades.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>By now, the group were stoked. "Mm... This is?" As she gasped, Eunie's clothing transformed to Taion's, including the orange scarf. Yet, she wasn't satisfied, "How come I got moodyguts's and not Noah's huh?" As she turned and looked at "moodyguts," his jacket changed to hers.</p>
<p>After scanning his new attire, he looked back at her equally curious: "That's what I'd like to know. Your class is the only one I can seem to pick, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Then, Lanz long coat turned into a thin silver ones, with its inside egg-yolk yellow. Sena, before she transformed, also wore one of those; after, Lanz's long coat. They tried summoning their blades, him wielding Sena's hammer, and she carried his broadsword.</p>
<p>Feeling its weight, he exclaimed, "Whoa... You can lug this thing about without a power frame? Not bad!"</p>
<p>As he looked at her, she was scratching her head showered with his praise. She smiled back at him, after which they withdrew their new blades.</p>
<p>Eunie, "Dunno how this is even working, but cool!"</p>
<p>Taion, "But is this all part of Ouroboros, too? If it gives us more options in battle, I'm all for it."</p>
<p>Sena agreed, "Yeah, I wanna take this new Blade out for a spin!"</p>
<p>Mio turned to Noah, asked, "From here, we head due south, right?" He nodded back.</p>
<p>He turned to the others, "Perfect. We can test them out on the road." He activated his iris, and his clothes returned to his; same with Mio.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a test battle, they sheathed their blades. Noah described his experience to Mio, "I felt a lot more nimble there, like the way you usually fight."</p>
<p>She looked at him, excited: "It looked like second-nature to you. It was crazy."</p>
<p>"You should have seen yourself!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, I think I could've thrashed you! With a little more practice..."</p>
<p>Eunie turned to Lanz, her hands behind her head, "Y'know, it's totally bananas... Ouroboros is bonkers powerful."</p>
<p>Lanz was stoked, "Right?"</p>
<p>Sena activated her iris and looked at Mio, seeing something different. While most of the upper part still blood red, orange started to fill the bottom part, like water in partially-filled bottle. "Ah! The gauge for the locked icon has filled right up!"</p>
<p>She reaffirmed after doing the same, "Same here!" Turning to Taion, it's no difference.</p>
<p>Taion drew conclusion, "So, logically, if we gain enough experience by fighting together, we'll become able to use each other's classes.That seems to be it." Then, he changed the topic, "As much as I'd like to experiment... "</p>
<p>Noah read his mind and completed his sentence, "Yeah, I guess we shouldn't stay in one place for too long."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Well, better get ourselves down south!"</p>
<hr />
<p>In a valley, where lights were poor. Taion called for a pause, "Hold it a moment..." As everyone turned and faced him, he continued, "I have a proposal as to our next route."</p>
<p>Mio: "OK. Shoot."</p>
<p>"I'll send you the map data." As they checked their irises, a map with blue dot showed their current location. They were currently at an intersection, with two routes, one to the East, another to the West. "Broadly speaking, it's either east or west. I would suggest we go west." As he finished, he drew a line on the map to visualize.</p>
<p>"Why's that?"</p>
<p>"The area to the west is under Agnus's control. There is a certain degree of risk, as they'll have deployed a number of units... but it's the quickest way to get south."</p>
<p>"What about the east route?" Noah drew a line to the East, prompting for more info.</p>
<p>To which he replied, "No man's land. None of the colonies have laid claim to it as of yet. However, we'd suffer a significant time loss."</p>
<p>Sena: "Time... versus risk."</p>
<p>Lanz was concerned, "Wait a sec. We're gonna stir up the Skeeter nest?"</p>
<p>Taion looked at him, "I only said there was a 'degree' of risk." He tried to drum it up with livelier tone, "Really, it's not so bad."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't convinced, wrapping her arms around her chest "But Agnian troops <em>are</em> deployed there, yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And we're still gonna go?"</p>
<p>"All I said is that it would be more efficient."</p>
<p>"Efficient."{{footnote: One didn't recognize whose voice is this, Mio or Eunie.}}</p>
<p>Sena seconded him: "Well, maybe we do need to be more efficient! Faster is better! We don't wanna be dragging our heels forever... right?"</p>
<p>Mio, with her arms crossed: "Hey! I just have to ask... Are you trying to push some agenda?"</p>
<p>He was pushing his glasses up (again), perhaps gotten caught? "Wha-? No... Certainly not..."</p>
<p>"But you admit the east route is the safer option. That's just strange. Why wouldn't you pick the safe way?" Mio pressed for more.</p>
<p>"Because time is of the-"</p>
<p>She cut him off, "Look. There you go again."</p>
<p>He sighed, continued, "That's not all, though! It's all wasteland to the east. The... the heat! It'll be unbearable!"</p>
<p>Sena agreed, both hands under her cheeks held into a fist and nodding to her, "Er... Yeah, you're gonna melt in the sun!"</p>
<p>Mio shook her head, "I'm fine with your choice. But we need to think about everyone's safety."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Noah, what's your take?"</p>
<p>"Me? Uhh..." Noah was watching their drama, haven't thought about his own decision. The Agnians turned their focus to him and waited. He looked down for a while, reminiscing his chat with Mio's, on her diary, on how she felt happy speaking to him just like that, on her smile. His raised his head, their eyes met. A few moments later, he seconded Mio's decision, "I think... I'd rather take the safe route."</p>
<p>Mio nodded back at him, grasping her hands together, palm on fist, putting it to her chest, thanking him in silence. Sena and Taion's slightly closed their eyes, heads tilted down in disappointment. He did not dismiss their worries. "As for the heat... We can probably figure something out."</p>
<p>Lanz: "There. Four against two."</p>
<p>Taion scoffed. Mio tried to convince the others, "Taion... Sena..." Sena looked towards Taion, he paused. "Please..."</p>
<p>With a sigh, he compromised, "Ngh... Fine, then. If you absolutely insist." Sena nodded back at her.</p>
<p>With a cheerful tone "Then it's settled!" As she walked towards the east route, taking the lead, "C'mon, cheer up guys! We're outta here!" Everyone followed behind. Noah was last to followed, his eyes on hers as she continued, perhaps relieved to had made her day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note on Environment:</strong> A tall pillar made of irregular rocks stood in the center. Copper-colored birds with wings stretching meters, like the wandering albatross but not really, one rest on the platform, another flew around. We could also see some deer in the distance with green tails. Also smaller animals like "bunnit" (rabbit with the tail of a squirrel). There were lofty platforms to both sides, like a sandy valley. Plants were rare, with only a few grass stucking out here and there. Behind the scene was a tall bridge that joined both platforms at the entrance. Sand could be seen falling down. There were also red short trees, like those saw in Ethel's colony in the distance as we entered the dune. Most sands were brown, but there was a patch of white sand aggregated as well. Irregular pillars of rock stuck out here and there. There was two platform in the distance, like two fingers about to crush the desert. This is <strong>Eagus Wilderness</strong>, of Fornis Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The blaring sun shone on the rocky floor. Flora and fauna were rare: two species, one was the red-leaved low tree we saw when consul K visited Ethel; another with long purple sword-like leaves that spreaded from its center, at about the same angle, making a fan-like structure. The latter shrub grows tall or short. Behind them is a platform which leads to a sandy dune, surrounded by even higher rocks on the other sides. The rocks seemed to be carved out from the center, as it looked to translator like an annihilation event happened and caused the shape. The group were walking <em>really</em> slow, exhausted from the unbearable heat. Sena and Mio were falling far behind, both took off their jackets.{{footnote: The others don't took off their jackets.}}</p>
<p>"Ugggh... So... hot..." Mio's face was blushing red, her steps unstable as she leaned on Sena whom helped her move forward, herself sweltering. "Can't... go... on..." As she finished, she dropped her body weight totally on Sena.</p>
<p>Sena had her hands over her shoulders, "Keep it together now, Mimi! I'll drag you along myself if I have to!"</p>
<p>Lanz overheard their conversation: "I mean, I get that it's hot, but really?"</p>
<p>"Whether we're talking food or weather, Mio does not take to heat." Taion replied, looking back at her, "I knew this would happen." Probably why he preferred the detour earlier.</p>
<p>Noah: "Heat's never bothered you, has it, Lanz?"</p>
<p>Lanz smiled, showing his left arm's biceps, "Nnnope. I'm made of sterner stuff."</p>
<p>Noah took a look at Mio. Her eyes totally closed, ears drooped down. Then, he exclaimed in a lower tone, "Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little worn out. Spot to rest would be nice about now."</p>
<p>Something caught Sena's attention in the distance, "Hey, look! There!" The group turned to her. Mio's head totally bent down as she told her, "Mimi, look! It's water! There's an oasis!"</p>
<p>"Wa...w-water...?" She strenuously carried her head up to look at the distance. With blurry vision, she saw a glimmering spot, lights casting on it. The reflection from the pool was blinding. On the left of the water, there was a taller platform with a cave entrance to its end. On the right before the pool, there was a plant that looked like bird nest fern growing on the floor.</p>
<p>"Yeah, water!"</p>
<p>"Water!!!" Suddenly, she regained all her strengths. Her eyes lit up bright, focused on that pool of water. Her ears stood up straight. She no longer depended on Sena.</p>
<p>"C'mon! Let's go!" Sena encouraged.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Immediately, she dashed past the group with Sena followed. The group quickly got to the side, leaving a trail for them. Lanz and the others can't believed their eyes.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh, come on. Talk about overreacting."</p>
<p>Taion: "We should be thankful they're back in high spirits." His Mondo was up in the air when they dashed past, and it spiralled back down slowly.</p>
<p>Noah wasn't feeling too hopeful, "Let's just hope it's not a mirage..." They slowly took steps behind those dashing two.</p>
<hr />
<p>Riku and Manana emerged from underwater. Sena was backstroking to float. Mio did some buoyancy breaststroke. "Ahahah! Nice and cool!" Now that she regained strength, she could play a while with the water, splashing up.</p>
<p>Sena: "Thank the Clock..."</p>
<p>"Ooooooooh...ahhh" Eunie had took off her jacket, ran and jumped, hands flung on top with bent knee, diving into the water. She landed in between the four, some water splashed around.</p>
<p>"Aw'right then... My turn!" Lanz took his jacket off, move backwards a few step, preparing for a run.</p>
<p>Noah and Taion turned their attention to him, with the former asking: "You too?"</p>
<p>He stretched his hands to his back and rolled his heads to warmup. "Don't happen every day!" As he finished, he made a run and jumped, "Yeeeeee...ahhhhhh!" He aimed to land at the center of the group.</p>
<p>"Waah?!" Sena and the group were shocked to see a huge shadow coming in their direction. His knees were bent while he soared. As he reached his desired landing point, he flung his arms up and stretched his legs straight, the others watching him slammed into the water as the ripple pushed the girls away from the point of contact. The nopons sink into the water, slowly floating up a moment later, fainted.</p>
<p>Eunie breathed hard as she emerged from underwater, turned to face where Lanz dived immediately, punching the water as she speaks, "You muppet!"</p>
<p>Lanz emerged a moment later, some water sprayed at Mio whom was very near him, which she blocked with her hands. "NEVER do that again!"</p>
<p>Lanz turned to his back, trying to soothe Eunie's anger, "C'mon! You're already soaking wet anyway! What difference does it make?" He swam off, freestyle, into the distance as he finished.</p>
<p>Eunie sniped back, "The difference is, you're an arsehole! What snuffin' difference..." Then, she pat one side of her temple hard, her head rolled in the other direction, "Uggh, I've got water in my ears now...!"</p>
<p>From a higher location, we could see where the Noah and Taion stood at an elevated platform, compared to the oasis bank on the opposite side. As those guys watched the drama, Mio and Sena regrouped, the nopons still fainted floating, and Eunie was trying to catch Lanz. Noah asked, "Staying here, are you?"</p>
<p>He immediately checked his iris, "I've got something to take care of.I'll send it to you now."</p>
<p>Noah checked it. "A map?"</p>
<p>"From a survey branch." There were several locations marked green, some cover huge distance, others puny. "Annihilation events occur frequently here."</p>
<p>Noah deactivated his iris and faced him, "Annihilation events? You mean..."</p>
<p>We were reminded by the two planets approaching each other, a huge blast of energy released, then looking at the animal-like snowy peak, a ball of energy emerged from nowhere and carved it into two as it disappeared later.</p>
<p>Taion nodded back. He turned to look at the opposite direction, "Look." This confirmed translator's guess earlier. (Though, something weird being a rock was floating mid-air, even though it's not an anti-gravity mechanism). {{footnote: There were some machines behind Taion, which is a nopon travelling merchant stall; but that's inexistent if you play the game the first time; only existed if you replay, so we'll emit it.}} Further away, we could see a platform stretched to the right.</p>
<p>"It happens here too." They turned their attention to the Oasis walls, which were also carved out by annihilation event.</p>
<p>"Given our route, we should take the safest way possible." He continued.</p>
<p>"Very cautious of you."</p>
<p>"It's my duty to be." He continued checking his iris.</p>
<p>"Thank you." He patted him on his shoulder, as if giving him the job.</p>
<p>Taion was shocked, turned his attention to him, "Uh... Sure." He saw him walked to the back, taking off his jacket. Then, he ran, jumped, and dived. Another big water splashed up, and we could hear the girls roared in the distance. "Whoa!"</p>
