<p>While traversing the icy mountains, 3 tiny levnises canceled their invisibility status and appeared in front of the group. They once seen one of these in Maktha Wildwood. They were immediately alerted, with Noah distressingly exclaimed, "What's this now?!"</p>
<p>The levnises immediately summoned their double-handed axes. Lanz: "Seriously? More of those mudders, come to ruin our day again?!"</p>
<p>Sena summoned her hammer, suggested, "Let's ruin theirs first!" Seeing no other choices than encounters, the others prepared for the fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the fight, one slash or a knock sent the levnises back, sparking electricity. Mio launched herself towards them; the groups had created some distance in between. "<strong>Haaaaaaaa!!</strong>" She aimed for the central one, but the one to her right came out and blocked her, 1v1.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mimi!</strong>" The levnis put her axe up to the left, signaling the other two to retreat. Then, it faced the group itself, walking slowly towards the group.</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Incoming!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "A tactical retreat?" Then, he attacked it, helped by Eunie; but the levnis easily blocked their attacks by axe slashes. Then, it dashed towards the group.</p>
<p>"<strong>Lanz!</strong>" Noah and Lanz therefore started dashing towards the levnis.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got it!" Both of them blocked two of the axes. Then, he called out, "Sena! Hit 'em where it hurts, will ya?"</p>
<p>"<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!</strong>" And it shattered the chest of the Levnis, revealing a female inside. Sena was shocked at what she'd revealed, sheathed her weapons and went after the damaged Levnis. The Flame Clock was still attached to the Levnis, glowing pink; it was one-sixth filled. "Huh! What the...? What's going on here...?" The female had short (neck-long) gray hair, one side covering one of her eyes. She wore a collar glowing pink, and a dark vest. Her smash had been strong; she was unconscious, stunned.</p>
<hr />
<p>They got the female out of the cask and laid her on the floor, while Riku went to check the Levnis, and Manana taking care of her. The group gathered around to discuss. Noah started the conversation, "Who is this girl...? Where did she come from? For a soldier, she's awfully, uhm..."</p>
<p>Eunie folded her arms, "Yeah, I know what you mean. She looks about three terms old. Way too young to be fighting on the front lines."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Not to derail the convo, but are we sure she'll be OK? We pulled her outta the Lev, but is there anything else we can do?"</p>
<p>Taion stated his observations, "I don't see any external injuries, but no signs of waking up either. Hard to tell either way."</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Sena felt that it was her fault to crush such an innocent-looking third termer.</p>
<p>Mio heard her grunt and comforted her, "Sena, don't worry. She's still alive. I'm sure she'll pull through."</p>
<p>"<em>Mimi... You sure...?</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Look, we can talk about her all day, or we can find her a doctor. I know which one I'd prefer."</p>
<p>Taion: "All right, but she and her people did assault Colony soldiers, so taking her to a Colony seems like asking for trouble."</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Then how about the City? They have medical facilities there."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Seems advisable."</p>
<p>Lanz hadn't forgotten, "What do we do about the Levnis?"</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, "Let's leave it for now. Transporting the girl should take priority."</p>
<p>Sena volunteered, "Uhm, I can carry her!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Thanks, Sena. She'll be in good hands."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll make sure of it."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the City, a doctor's aide told the group, "Ah, you're here. About the girl we transferred here... She's just woken up."</p>
<p>Sena was impressed, "Whoa! Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Although, I should say, she's a little, uhm..." What's the correct word to describe her situation?</p>
<p>Taion prompted, "Were there any complications?"</p>
<p>"<strong>No, nothing like that.</strong> Or at least, nothing to complain to you about."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You're not making sense, and it's getting me antsy."</p>
<p>"The doctor said she didn't need any medical attention, and... You know what, why don't you just talk to her yourselves? Just bear in mind, she's still a patient, so take it easy on her, eh?" And he walked away, leaving them dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Taion concluded, "Seems at least they kept her safe... But now what?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Yeah, it ain't like we can just leave her here forever...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Let's talk to her first, like he said. We should try to learn more."</p>
<p>Lanz: "All right, but she's recently injured. We probably shouldn't all, <em>crowd</em> her."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're right. If we're just asking questions, one person should be enough."</p>
<p>"Hmph. That sounds like a plan. So who'll go?" Taion questioned.</p>
<p>Lanz assumed "Surely it's Eunie, right? She deals with injured people all the time, she should be right at home."</p>
<p>Eunie teased him back, "Oh yeah? Cheers for volunteering me."</p>
<p>Sena unwaveringly interrupted, "I'll go."</p>
<p>"You, Sena? Why the sudden impulse?" Mio felt weird.</p>
<p>"Well, it's probably my fault she's like this..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "It was really more like an accident, y'know. There's no need for you to feel responsible."</p>
<p>"It's not that exactly, i-it's more like... If I don't do something, erm, I..." She tilted her head to think, "I'll have a dirty, con... urgh con... <strong>con</strong>-science?"</p>
<p>Taion was impressed, "You've never heard that word out loud, have you?"</p>
<p>And she dropped her head as if about to cry, "Orggggg...."</p>
<p>Noah sees no problem with that, "Well then, we'll leave the girl to you. Is that all right, Sena?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll be fine." Thanks for cheering!</p>
<p>Eunie: "Do be careful though. She might be meek now, but keep in mind she and her mates came after us."</p>
<p>"We'll be right outside. If anything happens, just shout."</p>
<p>"I can handle myself, Mimi. <em>But thanks, I will.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"OK then, I'm going in." Once inside, "Ah...!" The girl already seated herself on the bed, looking innocent. She had crimson iris{{footnote: Now that we can see since she opened her eyes.}}, and a long single braided pony tail that reached her waist. The room was like a hostel room rather than a hospital room, so there was only bed and some furniture.</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>Trying to break the ice, "Urrr, ummm... <strong>Hi!</strong> I-I see you've woken up!"</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"How are you feeling? Any pain?"</p>
<p>"Can confirm faint sensation of pain in cranial region. However, operational efficiency of No. 7 remains unaffected."</p>
<p>"<strong>Whuh?!</strong>" And she scratched her head, trying to comprehend what had just been said. "Ah, O-OK... That's... <em>good...?</em>{{footnote: Good my arse.}} Actually, I'd, uhm... I'd like to apologize heh..."</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"Before, I didn't realize you were inside that thing, and..."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Erm, are you OK?"</p>
<p>"No major issues detected."</p>
<p>"I-I see... Uh... Anyway, if it's all right with you, could you tell me something about yourself?"</p>
<p>"The question lacks specificity. No. 7, cannot respond."</p>
<p>And she was back scratching her head, "Oh, I'm really sorry! I-I guess that was <em>a bit wishy-washy, huh</em>... Well, for starters, then... Are you a Kevesi soldier? Or, are you Agnian?"</p>
<p>"Keves... Agnus..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right. You must know those, right?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative. However, discrepancy was encountered while processing query."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh? What do you mean?</em>"</p>
<p>"Affiliation of No. 7, does not match either of two options provided."</p>
<p>"Doesn't match...? Well then that only leaves..."</p>
<p>And she answered her before she make any guesses, "Special mobile combat unit under direct Moebius command, alias... Colony, 0."</p>
<p>"Whoa! You know about Moebius?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative."</p>
<p>"Then, when you attacked us..."</p>
<p>"Colony 0 soldiers of numbers 7 and below were tasked with eradication of Ouroboros."</p>
<p>She huffed and puffed, "Whhh-whoa, that's... <em>not great.</em>" And thinking in her head, "<em>So this girl really <strong>is</strong> our enemy... I have to warn the others...!</em>" And she took another look at her innocency and second-questioned her thoughts, "<em>Although... Is that really true? She did attack us... So, why is she like this now?</em>" And she closed her eyes to think for a while what to do with her before making her decision. Sena asked more to clarify her feelings, "Uhm, what you just told me... It sounded really important. Won't you get in trouble for saying it?"</p>
<p>"I was not ordered to silence on the matter."</p>
<p>"I, <em>I see, OK...</em> Oh, shoot, I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Sena. What's yours?"</p>
<p>"I have no name."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 7, does not possess information, under the category, 'name'."</p>
<p>"You don't have a name? Wait, so this, 'number seven' thing you've been saying all along...?"</p>
<p>"An individual identification number assigned to soldiers of Colony 0. We do not belong, to Keves, or Agnus. We are special assets. Publicly, we do not exist. Consequently, records of personal information stored in growth modules, are also expunged, at the time of birth."</p>
<p>"<em>That's... crazy...</em>"</p>
<p>"Shall I consider the questioning to be over?"</p>
<p>"No wait! What you just said... <em>You don't think it's strange?</em>"</p>
<p>"Cannot, ascertain, purpose of question. Requesting additional, clarification."</p>
<p>"I-I mean, for example... That name thing! A Colony that calls people by a number, that's so dehumanizing... Don't you feel bad to be called like that? I mean you're the same as us after all..."</p>
<p>"Cannot ascertain, purpose of question."</p>
<p>And she started feeling pity for her, "<em>Hrrrhhh... Ohh...</em>" She can't even fathom what it meant by dehumanizing.</p>
<p>She urged, "Requesting clarification." And Sena just can't stop sobbing. She didn't answer her, turned around and ran out of the room.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Sena?... <strong>Hey</strong>, you OK?" Lanz was concerned, seeing her face.</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Did you learn anything?... <em>Hang on, love, you don't look so good.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "What happened, Sena?"</p>
<p>With a sobbing tone, "<em>Mimi, I... I...! I don't know what to do...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah reassured, "Hey, Sena, everything's fine. Let's go somewhere we can talk. Is that all right?"</p>
<p>"<em>Y-yeah, sure...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Seated at the square park outside where they were permitted to cook in a square (not circle), after the group listened to the intel she'd gathered, Noah exclaimed, "<em>'Colony 0'...? Wow,...</em> they did seem like more than regular soldiers, but that's wild..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>If they're palling around with Moebius, we can't really ignore them, I suppose.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "We still have very little information. I think a more thorough investigation is in order."</p>
<p>Lanz: "OK, but we're talking about a tiny third-termer here."</p>
<p>"Hurrr..." There was something pressing on her heart. A person that had no name! And she didn't even realize!</p>
<p>Mio noticed there was still something in her head, questioned, "Sena, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> Wh-what do I think about what?"</p>
<p>"You're the one that spoke with her. What's your gut telling you?"</p>
<p>"I just... I-I just asked questions, and she just, answered them. But... Even though she attacked us, she doesn't seem hostile or violent... And when I spoke to her, she was literally, just answering questions, it didn't feel like a conversation at all... She looks like us, but is actually a <strong>whole</strong> different kind of <em>being... That's how I felt</em>.. a-and then I got scared of her, and..."</p>
<p>"Awh, I'm sorry, Sena..."</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "<em>Sena, give us your honest opinion. Do you think she's an enemy?</em>"</p>
<p>"I don't really know yet. That's kind of why I..." And she strengthen her mind, "I'd like to try talking to her again, <em>I think.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz can't understand, "Whaddya mean? You just said you were <strong>scared</strong> of her."</p>
<p>"<strong>I am</strong>, it's true, but... <em>I want to make sure</em> I got the right idea, and that's, stronger than my fear. Not just about if she's an enemy, but, also about, who she <em>actually</em> is, how she thinks and feels..."</p>
<p>"Ahh I get it. You need a bit more time for that, sure."</p>
<p>"Right. I also want to say sorry for leaving without saying anything, <em>last time...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie suggested, "OK then, if you're doing a house visit and apologizing at once, how about a little gift, <em>to grease the wheels?</em>"</p>
<p>That excites Mio somewhat, "<strong>Oh! Sena, you could bring her your onigiri!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Onigiri?" Noah clearly hadn't heard about that before (and perhaps not seen in her memories).</p>
<p>Taion explained, "It's a portable Agnian snack, made of packed, boiled mythrice."</p>
<p>Mio added enthusiastically, "They're lovely and salty, especially the way Sena makes them! They <strong>really</strong> hit the spot after a <strong>long</strong> training session."</p>
<p>Lanz was probably the most surprised, "<strong>Huh, you can make food...?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>O-of course I can!...</strong> Onigiri at least. <em>Oh, wait... Uhng... But we don't have any mythrice...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "They should have decent reserves in Colony Lambda."</p>
<p>Eunie instantly snapped, "Hey, nice...!" Then, her brain recoiled on her, "No, hang on, <strong>how did you know that</strong> off the top of your head?"</p>
<p>"Commander Isurd likes them. The onigiri."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Well, that's just peachy then. Hope he doesn't mind sharing."</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks, you guys!</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the Michiba Kitchen, she scratched her head with the ingredients placed in front of her. "Man, I haven't made onigiri in a minute... <em>Hope I can still shape them right!</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>After she produced the finished products, she congratulated herself, "Ahh, that's nice! Now, let's take them to our patient."</p>
<hr />
<p>Before entering the room, Taion interrupted, "<em>Sena, wait. This time around, we'd like to sit in on the conversation too.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh? But I thought..."</p>
<p>Lanz reassured, "No worries, we'll hang back and watch. We're happy to let you do the talking."</p>
<p>"Um, <em>OK then, if you say so...</em>"</p>
<p>No. 7, still sitting on the bed from earlier, raised her head and saw she was back, this time with the others. She stood forward and started speaking, "Hey, sorry to intrude... Can we have a moment?"</p>
<p>"No objections. You wish to resume questioning."</p>
<p>She shook her head, "N-no, that's- not why I'm here. <em>It's just that last time, I was kinda rude...</em> So, to apologize, I thought I'd visit again and, <strong>bring you</strong> a little something."</p>
<hr />
<p>On the table laid down her masterpiece. No. 7 had moved herself to sit in front of the onigiri. "<strong>Hmmm!!!</strong>" Awfully pleasant to the eyes, excellently arousing for the nose, and what's more...</p>
<p>"I-I figured you might be hungry. They're called onigiri..."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, she explained herself, "I'm not very good at this, so they're about the only thing I can make..."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<strong>But I can guarantee they're tasty, and actually,</strong> Mimi says so too... Ah, Mimi, I mean Mio, she's..."</p>
<p>"Yes." And they heard her stomach rumbled so loud it echoed the room. Her eyes fixed on the onigiri while she was listening to them talking and 'patiently' answering 'yes' to each of her statements, perhaps left ear in, right ear out.</p>
<p>Hearing so, Sena: "Oh, sorry, my bad! Please, uh feel free to eat."</p>
<p>"I will eat." And she picked up one onigiri and took a bite.</p>
<p>"<strong>How about it then?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Cannot affertain... uhm purpofe of... queftion..." That was talking while biting.</p>
<p>"Are they tasty? Did I make them right?"</p>
<p>"With regard to... firft queftion... No. 7, confiderf... 'tafty', to be, accurate... affeffment."</p>
<p>"Oh, r-r-really? That's good to hear!"</p>
<p>"In regard to... second, application, of, manual preffure... refulted in, compaction and, higher cohesion. Alfo showing, excess salt level..."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh...</em> <strong>No, wait, that's the best part! Isn't it nice and chewy?</strong>"</p>
<p>After swallowing what's in her mouth, she agreed, "Affirmative."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Then why are you saying the science is bad when you agree it's nice and chewy?</p>
<p>Turning her head to Sena, she added, "No. 7, has not taken sustenance, in this form before. Currently considering that others of Colony 0, may also enjoy, the experience."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh</em>, you think so?"</p>
<p>"Particularly No. 9, seemed to be growing, <strong>disaffected</strong> with the rations being distributed...{{footnote: She turned her head back on to focusing on the onigiri.}} And No. 3, whose calorie intake exceeds the baseline, may find, these more sating... As a precaution, salt levels may have to be marginally adjusted, pursuant to guidance from No. 6..."</p>
<p>"Hah..." That was informative, huh!</p>
<p>And she turned back towards Sena, "Hm... Is there a problem?"</p>
<p>"No, no, i-it's nothing. Oh, <em>but</em>... if it's OK with you, could I ask you to tell me more?"</p>
<p>"Acknowledged. Continuing explanation." And they continued talking while she finished the remaining onigiri.</p>
<hr />
<p>After finishing the plate, she got herself back sitting on the bed, with Sena standing beside, nearer to her. She hoped for another praise, perhaps, or just affirmative comments to soothe her confidence, "So, were the onigiri tasty?"</p>
<p>"You already have a sufficient reply to this question."{{footnote: LOL.}}</p>
<p>"Have you, come- to- <strong>like</strong> the onigiri I made?" OK, that <em>was</em> the real question.</p>
<p>"Affirmative."</p>
<p>With great smiles on her face, "Well, that's good then. I'll make them for you again sometime."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>In the background, Lanz stated his observation softly, "<em>Well, she eats like normal, and she can handle small talk.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Yeah, there's nothing suspicious about her. <em>Except she talks funny, but whatever.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio suggested, "Let's let Sena keep her talking for a bit longer."</p>
<p>Back at the spotlight, Sena changed the topic, "Hey, you said you didn't have a name."</p>
<p>"Recollection of making such a statement exists."</p>
<p>And she suggested with great encouragement, "Well, then... What about, 'Segiri'?"</p>
<p>And there was a long pause as she was trying to understand what she meant, "Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"Uh..." She started scratching her head as the atmosphere got somewhat nervous, anxious.</p>
<p>"Perhaps this is some sort of code, or cipher."</p>
<p>"<strong>No</strong>, I'm just... I was asking what you thought about, 'Segiri', for a name."</p>
<p>"Cannot follow logic behind query. Requesting more rational explanation."</p>
<p>"You're using difficult words again... I-I just, didn't want to keep <strong>only</strong> calling you 'you'."</p>
<p>"The designation 'No. 7', is..."</p>
<p>And she cut her off, "Right! I just took the 'se-' part from 'seven', a-and tacked on the 'giri' from 'onigiri'. 'Se-giri'!"</p>
<p>"Failure to comprehend basis for utilizing this nomenclature."</p>
<p>"Well, i-it's 'cause... You said you <strong>liked</strong> onigiri, just then... <em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz in the background interrupted for the first time, "<strong>Whoa</strong> whoa whoa whoa whoa, Sena... <em>Don't you think you're taking it a bit far?</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Yeah, love</em>... Did you lose your brain at the gym or something?"</p>
<p>Even Taion cannot fathom, "I'm sorry, Sena. I don't think I see what you're after here."</p>
<p>"Whoa, when did everyone get so mean? I think it's a great name, 'Segiri'..."</p>
<p>Noah scratched his head in agreement, against the others' opinions, "Y-yeah, I think so too, actually. It seems really, uh, friendly, somehow..."</p>
<p>Mio was supporting her as usual, "Ahaha! It's not really like <strong>you</strong> to come out with something like this, Sena."</p>
<p>"<em>R-really...?</em> Well, maybe so... But Mimi, I don't think it's right to <strong>call</strong> a person by a number..."</p>
<p>No. 7: "Hmm..."</p>
<p>"<em>Hey, I'm sorry. I let my mouth run away from me. I understand if you felt hurt by it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Regulations contain no special provisions, on restricting, designation."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 7 has no authority based on which to reject proposed designations, whatever they may be."</p>
<p>She tried to interpret her vocabulary, "<em>Does that mean we can call you 'Segiri', and you won't mind?</em>"</p>
<p>After thinking for a few second, she replied, "...Affirmative."</p>
<p>Eunie was impressed, teasingly commented, "Well, there you have it then, <em>affirmative.</em>" The last she tried to sound like Segiri robot-like voice with single-tone.</p>
<p>Mio congratulated her, "Mhmmm... Nicely done, Sena."</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks uhuh!" Thinking in her head, "<em>The girl might still be a total mystery, but really, it wouldn't have been right to call her 'number seven'...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that she was more used to the talking, the group gathered closer by Segiri's side, making a semicircle around the bed. Just then, beep beep sounded in Segiri's iris, and that alerted her, "<strong>Hmph!</strong>"</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"A coded transmission from Colony 0." She checked the popup and explained. Turning to the group, "The Moebius Consul F, is requesting parley, with the Ouroboros."</p>
<p>Noah cannot believed his ears, "<strong>The Moebius is requesting what...?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"No. 7, will use, <strong>own Iris</strong>, as relay to forward the transmission to you." And the group answered the call, joining in from their irises.</p>
<p>Moebius F, with a thick snail-shell head, standing in a dark place with no background, spotlight on him, started the conversation, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, my young Ouroboros friends. I am F, and before we go further, I would like to sincerely apologize for the discourtesy of this method of introduction."</p>
<p>Eunie was disgusted, "Ugh, what a shameless slug. He thinks we'll forget he tried to kill us?"</p>
<p>Taion replied, "You say you want to parley. How do you imagine <em>that will go, at this point...?</em>"</p>
<p>"I am certain you will feel guarded, and rightly so. And yet, with that acknowledged, I would like to offer an opening of <em>negotiations with you.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Negotiations?"</p>
<p>"Should you accept my invitation, I will rescind the extermination order on you Ouroboros. Colony 0 will henceforth no longer concern itself with <strong>your</strong> comings and goings."</p>
<p>Lanz sniped back 'positively', "<strong>Oh, that'd be swell!</strong>... If we were stupid enough to trust your word."</p>
<p>Noah: "And your demands?"</p>
<p>After a short pause, "...<em>The bodily return of No. 7.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Noah: "And that's it? That's all it would take for you to never fight with us again?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you have my guarantee, and that of the whole of Colony 0."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Are you joking? You're Moebius. You'd <strong>throw</strong> away one or two soldiers without <strong>batting</strong> an eye.</em>"</p>
<p>"Certainly, some Consuls do display such callousness, a <strong>deplorable</strong> state of affairs... But not I. I hold the light of life possessed by Colony 0 to be of the <strong>utmost</strong> importance. <em>Naturally, that includes No. 7.</em> That is precisely why I have reached out to you, nominally my enemies, even <strong>with</strong> the concomitant difficulties acknowledged."</p>
<p>Sena sternly asked, "Are you telling the truth?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "C'mon Sena, don't fall for it..."</p>
<p>Sena continued, "Can you give us a guarantee that you aren't lying to us right now?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Of course!</strong>... is what I would love to say but, <strong>naturally</strong>, simple words are never enough to engender trust, I know." Then, he sent some data to Segiri, then continued, "I have sent the current coordinates of Colony 0 to No. 7. We shall remain here. <em>Should you find yourselves receptive to my offer</em>, do <strong>please</strong> pay us a visit, <em>and bring No. 7 with you.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "<strong>So you think giving us your location will make us trust you?</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion added, "How do we know this isn't a trap?"</p>
<p>"<em>In such a circumstance, you would possess a handy hostage in No. 7. I trust I needn't say more?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ugh... <strong>Had this guy heard</strong> the way he sounds?"</p>
<p>F shook his head, "Of course, that is not what any of us really want. My desire is to see No. 7 <em>safely returned to me. That is all.</em>" Then he called out, "No. 7."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I am tasking you with guiding them to Colony 0. Follow their command until your return."</p>
<p>"Compliance."</p>
<p>"And... No. 7?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<em>We've all been worried about you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Hmmm..."</p>
<p>"<em>That will be all. I will eagerly anticipate the day when we meet in more favorable circumstances.</em>" And he ended the call.</p>
<p>And Segiri stood up thereafter, restating, "By the Consul's authority, No. 7 is hereby assigned to the Ouroboros' command, as an exceptional measure for the duration. Pending your decision on the outcome of the proposed exchange, I await your command to depart."</p>
<p>Noah scratched his head, "<em>Well this was... unexpected.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena voiced her thoughts loudly, "Segiri... <em>What do we do with you...?</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Still gathering around Segiri in the room, Lanz questioned, "Wait, are you serious? You <strong>really</strong> trust that Consul?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Of course I don't, not entirely. I know it could be a trap, as well, but still... If... And, this is a big 'if', OK? If he was telling the truth earlier, then we won't have to fight with Segiri and her friends... And more importantly, I'm sure there are people waiting for her there... So, for all those reasons, <em>I thought...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah crossed his arms, "Well, either way, things can't stay like this forever."</p>
<p>Taion concluded her thoughts, "Rather than make speculation after speculation and do nothing, you want to set something in motion."</p>
<p>Mio considered, "It's also possible, if unlikely, <em>that we <strong>might</strong> be able to talk it through...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah, turning to Segiri, "All right. Can you tell us where Colony 0 is right now?"</p>
<p>"Aetia region, Captocorn Peak."</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh? Wait, isn't that...?"</p>
<p>Eunie finished her sentence, "That's where we fought against those guys, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"The point where Colony 0 is stationed, is located even further in."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>That explains why you were lying in wait for us there.</em>"</p>
<p>And then she warned, "However, the geographical feature, called the 'Nocclia Mire', is located, en route. Entering it, is predicted to have severe negative impact, on your biological processes."</p>
<p>"Then how do you guys get through?" Mio asked.</p>
<p>"A Ferron's environmental hazard resistance, can temporarily neutralize poisonous materials."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "What's a 'Ferron'...? <em>Oh, is that the thing you were riding inside?</em>"</p>
<p>"Affirmative. Consequently, traversal through the afflicted area, will necessitate, retrieval and refurbishing, of the abandoned Ferron suit."</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "We can ask Riku to fix it up. Will that be OK with you?"</p>
<p>"No objections."</p>
<p>Scratching his head, "Ohhh, if Riku must. Will not leave friends in lurch."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>All right then. Just be patient for us a little while longer, OK, Segiri?</em>"</p>
<p>"Compliance."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found the abandoned Ferron, with Segiri tagging along. After some examination from Riku, Noah asked, "How does it look, Riku? Can you get it in working order?"</p>
<p>"It look like problem mostly cosmetic. Riku have it working in no time flat."</p>
<hr />
<p>After some fixing, "Annnnddd ready. Riku proud of own handiwork."</p>
<p>Sena: "And how does it look to you? Can you still use it?"</p>
<p>Segiri reported the statistics from inside the Ferron, now that she climbed into it, "Power lines clear. All sensors online... Ferron unit No. 7, fully operational."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>That... sounds good? A-are you ready to guide us?</em>" Nope, don't understand all the checks and technical stuff, but let's continue.</p>
<p>"Understood. Designating route."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found Consul F at the location he sent them. There were other levnises and Ferrons parked around the edge of the open-ended cavern. Open-ended means the cavern opened itself to the sky, with a cliff at the edge, and they could look out to other mountains from the inside, or just, jump off the cliff, if they'd like to. F: "Welcome, friends. I have been hoping you would come."</p>
<p>Noah: "We've brought your soldier as you asked. So what now?"</p>
<p>He turned to Segiri, whom climbed out of her Ferron and stood beside Sena, examined her from afar, "Hmm... No. 7 seems uninjured. Thank you for this magnanimous measure. As promised, Colony 0's order to eradicate Ouroboros, will be rescinded. <strong>You have my word</strong>, that we will never again <em>darken your doorsteps, figuratively speaking</em>."</p>
<p>Eunie didn't believed a word, "Hah. Talk is cheap, man."</p>
<p>"Oh I assure you, the soldiers of Colony 0 are <strong>most</strong> faithful. They would <strong>never</strong> disobey, an issued order. What's more, I personally have nothing but the deepest respect for you all. After all, you did tend to my dear No. 7, and brought her back to me <strong>unscathed</strong>... I offer you my sincere, <em>heartfelt thanks.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Yeeeahh, all right...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie, arms folded, shook her head, "<em>This, doesn't sit right with me.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh I have just had the greatest idea. No. 7, you and our guests have traveled long and far to arrive here. Why don't we introduce them to the rest of the Colony 0 personnel?"</p>
<p>"Complaince."</p>
<p>Noah was feeling not, shaking his head, "Uh, <strong>I think we're actually fine...</strong>"</p>
<p>The Consul shook his head, "Nonsense, no need to be shy. We need to tie a bond of trust between us, and where better to start than with a round of introductions?" Makes sense.</p>
<p>Sena asked, "Segiri, are you all right with that?"</p>
<p>"The Consul's word is absolute. No. 7, does not have the prerogative of choice."</p>
<p>"No. 7, show your face to everyone. I'm sure they'd like that... No. 4 has also been worried about you."</p>
<p>"...Yes."</p>
<p>Sena: "No. 4?"</p>
<p>The Consul explained, "No. 4 is No. 7's right-hand man. <em>With No. 7 absent,</em> he had to take over the <em>reins instead.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie got it, "He means like being an aide, then?"</p>
<p>Sena caught the important terms, "Segiri, does that make you the commander?"</p>
<p>"Parts of the definition appear discrepant, but on the whole, there are no major issues with that denomination."</p>
<p>Surprised, she let out, "You could've told us, you know..."</p>
<p>"I have no record, of the fact being queried."</p>
<p>Noah's eyes peered over his shoulder to the right, where Taion stood, silently commented, "<em>You've noticed it too, right, Taion?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I can't make sense of it. The Consul's attitude is one thing, <em>but more importantly...</em>"</p>
<p>Skimming the cave, Noah continued, "<em>The Ferronis. The one thing a colony needs, and there's no sign of it here. Or maybe... Maybe it's just, something completely different from the colonies we know?</em>"</p>
<p>Taion shook his head, unable to ascertain, "A special unit under direct Moebius command... Were we too hasty, coming here?"</p>
<p>Sena turned to Sena and Segiri, whom were still chatting, "<em>For Sena's sake, and for that girl she trusts, let's hope not.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Colony, Segiri met with No. 4, a young boy wearing the swimsuit-like costume too, pointed chin, large eyes, and boy-like hair (???), conversing with her, "No. 7... I'm relieved to see you back safe." We noticed there was also the collar on his neck, but because she don't have the long-hair like Segiri's, we can see it was a backbone-like structure attached to his backbone.</p>
<p>She immediately get back to her work status, "No. 4. No status abnormalities?"</p>
<p>"We're all good here. No. 10 and No. 8 are currently on a mission, but should be back soon."</p>
<p>Segiri thought for a while, seeing that he had misunderstood her. "Revising query. Are there status abnormalities in No. 4's condition?"</p>
<p>"A-a-ah, no, I'm OK. No. 4 can still fight." He really thought deep about it as he felt himself.</p>
<p>"However..."</p>
<p>"No. 7, you're not at fault. If anything, i-i-it's my fault, having such poor abilities in battle. Without disengaging the Ferron's limiter, I-I couldn't fight properl- Urgggh..." And he just started falling and grumbling in pain.</p>
<hr />
<p>After he lose consciousness, Segiri immediately stepped forward and held him by his shoulder, prevented him from falling, "Huuuuhhh, No. 4!"</p>
<p>Lanz was concerned, "Wh-what's wrong? What is it?" And red motes started floating off his body.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Sparks, you don't think this is..."</p>
<p>Mio: "His flame's leaking...!"</p>
<p>No. 4 still had his conscious, knell on the floor as Segiri followed him down, "Hrrrrrr... I'm cold... No. 7... Where are... I can't see... a thing... Hoh" After a while, his flames stopped leaking. Segiri put him down on the floor. While he hadn't turned into a dry husk, his eyes were bland and lifeless, unconscious. His face turned dark, lifeless.</p>
<p>"Huuuuorrrrrr..."{{footnote: No. 4 actually lost his life; he never revive later in the story.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena, in a hushed tone, "<strong>Segiri! What just happened?!</strong>"</p>
<p>F was the one explaining, "No. 4 has given his life to the Ferron."</p>
<p>They turned to him, with Lanz asking: "<em>Oi, you'd better explain yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>He turned to look at the Ferron, explained, "The Ferrons are powered by life's flames. The Flame Clocks that impel them are synchronized to <em>those of their passengers.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion was thinking when he heard the key term, "Wait, did you say Flame Clocks? Does that make the Ferrons...?"</p>
<p>He knew what he's asking about, nodded, "Indeed. The design differs, but you could see them as functionally identical to Ferronises. In addition, Ferron Flame Clocks are fitted with the function to disengage the limiters."</p>
<p>Noah squinted, "'Disengage the limiters'...?"</p>
<p>"Doing so allows the Ferron to burn through the flames that fuel it at an accelerated rate, maximizing the unit's power output. Once the limiter is disengaged, a first-term soldier can perform at a level comparable to a colony's commander... That incandescent power is the <strong>pith</strong>, and marrow of the <strong>Ferron's, of Colony 0's might.</strong>" And his tone got excited.</p>
<p>Taion prompted for more explanations, "But what <em>is</em> Colony 0, to begin with? Who are you, who are its soldiers?"</p>
<p>"You could say we are those who work behind the scenes of this war. Battlefield manipulation, inciting sedition, information control, elimination of third party forces... It's all due to our <strong>ceaseless, thankless efforts</strong>, that this war can continue unabated, and each life's fate arrives, as ordained... In other words, we <strong>maintain</strong> the <strong>fabric</strong> of the world. <strong>That, is the duty which is our pleasure to fulfill.</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion wasn't convinced. "Nothing but empty words. <strong>That's the</strong> reason you put your men in those things?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well mate, <strong>you</strong> just showed us your whole arse. I knew <em>you didn't care about the lives of your soldiers after all!</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Preposterous! I treasure their lives above any other good! They are, to me, the most exalted substance!</strong> Their immaculate lives, <strong>sacrificed in service to the world</strong>, permeate it, and form the basis of the eternity <strong>WE MOEBIUS COVET...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena had been controlling to not explode, closing her eyes all along, "<em>Stop it.</em>"</p>
<p>He hadn't heard her, continued his explanation, "Protecting my innocent lambs whose souls <strong>lubricate the gears of the world, through a sublime sacrifice -- that, is the HIGHEST CALLING!!! Isn't it the loftiest vocation conceivable? Surely you must agree-</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>SHUT UP ALREADY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>He was flabbergasted, "Ah I must beg your pardon. Have I said something to incur your displeasure?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Snuff all of that, and snuff you! How dare you... How could someone like you think for a SECOND you treasure Segiri! You have no right! We'll bring you down, right here and now... Segiri and everyone will be FREE from the Flame Clocks!</strong>"</p>
<p>He didn't understood, can't fathomed, "But what in the blazes has brought this on? I told you from the start, I had no intention of fighting you..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment thought, and looked up, made up his mind, "<em>Well, it seems unavoidable, now...</em> It seems the negotiations have broken down. Truly regrettable, and yet perhaps, inevitable..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"All Ferron units, heed my call! You are ordered to disengage your limiters."</p>
<p>"Huh!" So that's an order? And you said you care about my life? Just after No. 4 had over-disengaged his limiters and collapsed in front of me?</p>
<p>"No. 7. Your orders. <strong>Bring all your might to bear and crush the Ouroboros.</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena turned around and shouted to her, "<strong>SEGIRI! LISTEN! YOU DON'T-</strong>"</p>
<p>"Complaince." And she shakily stood up, her voice firm, then continued, "Commencing Ouroboros annihilation."</p>
<p>"<em>Segiri.</em>" And she walked towards her Ferron while Sena was feeling sad about it. She booted it up, other Ferrons lined at the edge of the cliff also activated theirs (except for No. 4's). Consul F teleported behind Segiri while the other Ferrons moved up to lined up with her. All except Sena drew their blades to prepare for the fight.</p>
<p>Taion was trying to get her into status, speaking from behind her, "I know how you must feel... But for now, we have to fight, Sena."</p>
<p>Segiri: "All units fall in and stand by."</p>
<p>Eunie was confused, "Wh-what's this?"</p>
<p>"Consul, a report."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, No. 7?"</p>
<p>"Large expenditure of life's flames is forecast, if limiters are disengaged for combat. Proposal following analysis of all units' flame totals: Restrict limiter disengagement, to unit No. 7."</p>
<p>"Hmm... I see."</p>
<p>Lanz was equally confused, "What...? <em>What's she doing? Trying to get her mates out of fighting?</em>"</p>
<p>Sena gasped; she might have realized something.</p>
<p>F had finished making decisions, "No. 7, I recognize your <strong>unparalleled</strong> radiance. It brings you honor. Now behold. By my authority as Consul, I order you: <strong>All Ferron units, disengage limiters!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh!" And all Ferron flames burst, changing from blue flames into purple flames.</p>
<p>"<strong>SEGIRI!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "That <em>snuffer</em>! Just when I thought he couldn't go <em>lower</em>!"{{footnote: Oh it rhymes!}}</p>
<p>"Oh, No. 7... <strong>Truly you are a marvel.</strong> The cry wafting from your spirit, <strong>it will water this endless world and make it bloom eternal!</strong>" And F teleported away to unknown places, leaving the place for them to fight.</p>
<p>Mio instructed, "First off, let's deal with <strong>these</strong> guys!"</p>
<p>Sena had recuperated from her sadness temporarily, "Yeah! Just wait, Segiri... <strong>We'll get you out of this mess, I promise!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Segiri's Ferron dashed towards them with dual axes launching at them. Sena shouted, "<strong>LANZ!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>YEAH!!</strong>" And they transformed into Ouroboros form, with Sena in control, blocking the axes with the handle of her hammer.</p>
<p>"Segiri, please! Just snap out of it! You don't. have. to follow these orders! <strong>Segiri,</strong> you're free to do what you want!" And she pushed her back.</p>
<p>As she stood up, "Segi-... Free... to...?" She was temporarily out of the Consul's expectations.</p>
<p>F teleported in, seeing the situation not well, "Well now... Hmm, what a curious phenomenon. No. 7, I'm changing your orders. <strong>Kill</strong> that Ouroboros first. Top priority."</p>
<p>"Uck-... Complia-..." Her head felt throbbing as she felt irresistible to orders.</p>
<p>"<strong>Don't do it, Segiri!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's an order</strong>, No. 7."</p>
<p>"<strong>Urrrrrggggghhhhhh! ARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>" And she threw an axe at Sena's Ouroboros. It didn't hit, but flew past her.</p>
<p>"No. 7? What are you <strong>ARGGGGGHHHH!!!</strong>" The axe had sliced through him from behind him.</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>ARRRGGGGHHH... Im... poss... N-n-No.</strong> <em>7</em>" Black fog had started leaking out of his damaged core. Sena, seeing the situation right, threw her hammer and knocked the Consul down; he couldn't even dodge. One hit KO, and he turned into blue motes. All Ferrons therefore disabled themselves.</p>
<p>After cancelling the Interlink, "<strong>SEGIRI!!!</strong>" She dashed towards her Ferron, shouted from outside, "<strong>ARE YOU OK?! Please, TALK TO ME, SEGIRI!!!</strong>" The rest of the group joined behind her, equally concerned.</p>
<p>Speaking from within her Ferron, "Urgghhh...Number... Four..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 4... Don't go... No. 7... will protect... No. 4... Everyone..."</p>
<p>Sena thought for a while, turned to "Noah, please... For Segiri... <strong>For them all...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Right!" And he cut through the tiny Flame Clocks in front of their Ferron.{{footnote: God knows what power source they use after this.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Segiri was standing in front of No. 4's Ferron, looking at it attentively. Sena was standing some short distance behind her, while the group waited even further behind. After a while, she walked up to her, to which Segiri spoke after sensing her, "With the Consul's death in the line of duty, Colony 0's chain of command, is broken. No. 7, currently has no duties to perform, and no orders to follow."</p>
<p>"<em>That means you don't have to fight us any more.</em>"</p>
<p>"However, it is a matter of record, that No. 7, took hostile action, against Ouroboros. Perhaps, you wish to mete out an appropriate punishment."</p>
<p>"<strong>Segiri, you did nothing wrong!</strong> Really, we should be thanking you."</p>
<p>"Thanking? Why would... that be?"</p>
<p>"I mean... Before, you attacked the Consul instead of us, so... You held back, from fighting us, and thanks to that, we were able to take down the Consul."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's enough about that. Now it's time to think to the future, right?"</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, "I. Cannot. Comprehend."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Why do you speak to No. 7 that way? Under what orders, and from whom? Why did No. 7 disobey orders? Why did <em>I</em> not attack you as instructed? Requesting swift reply. Furthermore, requesting orders."</p>
<p>"<em>Segiri...</em>"</p>
<p>"No. 7... is... <strong>confused</strong>!... <em>I</em> do not know what actions to take."</p>
<p>"I know what it's like to feel lost, uncertain, not know where to turn. But even <strong>you</strong>, must have some things you think you'd really like to do, right?"</p>
<p>"No. 7 does not have thoughts matching that description."</p>
<p>"In that case, let's put our heads together! Let's think of things you might wanna do."</p>
<p>"Is that an order?"</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh. Nobody's giving you orders any more. From now on, Segiri... The only orders you should follow, <em>are your own</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH!!!</strong>" And she searched through her mind for a while before continuing, "The situation described, does not conform to the accepted definition of, 'orders'."</p>
<p>"I... It was just like a, <strong>metaphor!</strong> Or... <em>Or was it a simile...?</em>"</p>
<p>"I. Really. Cannot. Comprehend."</p>
<p>"Uhh..."</p>
<p>Before she could think of how to explain, she explain it herself, "But, although I cannot comprehend... 'Segiri gives orders to No. 7.' If the circumstances be interpreted this way, then Segiri... I... may be able to comprehend."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, Segiri...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Is it... odd?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>No, I don't think so. I'm sure it's- exactly- right. Since, after all, you're free now.</em> So, Segiri? What- are- your- orders- for- 'No. 7'?"</p>
<p>Putting her hands on her chin, "Top priority, should be to investigate what it is that I- 'want to do'. More data must be gathered before this is ascertained."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, "Ahaha... That sounds <em>very</em> like you, but I think you're making it too complicated. It doesn't have to be just- one- thing, and, it can be anything, really!"</p>
<p>"It can be... anything?"</p>
<p>"Yep, anything at all."</p>
<p>"In that case..."</p>
<p>"Yes? Did you think of something?" And her stomach started rumbling.</p>
<p>"Right now... I think I'd like... one of your onigiri... Sena." And she gladly.</p>
<hr />
<p>After quenching her hunger, Noah approached the two, "By the way, I-I wanted to ask about the Ferron... I suppose there's no way to use them any more?"</p>
<p>"That- statement- is incorrect."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Oh</em>, really?"</p>
<p>"Motive function can be restored by switching to alternative power source, using ether cylinders.{{footnote: There you go! New power source!}} Power output will be inferior to the original Flame Clock system, and the limiter can't be removed, but shouldn't hinder combat. I will be able to fight on."</p>
<p>"Wow, t-that's great news. Do you think we can ask you to fight- by our side again, then?"</p>
<p>"Understood. Ferron unit No. 7, will gladly join, Ouroboros battle unit."</p>
<p>"We'll be counting on you then, Segiri!"</p>

<p><strong>Note from Translator:</strong> We won't be doing the 2nd part of the story. Long story short, after they'd relocated to the prison camp, they do something stuffs, and then they'd met No. 13, Segiri's twin (that connects heart to heart), and bla bla bla. OK, enough of that. You could watch them yourselves if you're interested in that story from one's brief abstract/introduction/(spoiler).</p>
