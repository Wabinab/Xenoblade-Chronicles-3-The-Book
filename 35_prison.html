<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Kitchen behind bars. Inmates sat around tables and chat. Prison guards stood on a higher level to watch them out, while ladders behind bars to protect them from being overwhelmed by the inmates. The main room was where the kitchen was, lined with tables. Though, there were also some empty space where tables weren't placed. An alleyway lead downstairs towards the cells. Inmates were free to roam around with their cells unlocked. This, is <strong>Li Garte Prison Camp</strong>, of Cadensia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group had entered the wind duct, watching behind the turning blades. No soldiers watched in their direction, but there were two guards with lance below, and a guard walking and stood in between these two, unseen the group above and behind him. Suddenly, some sound came from the opposite side of where the group was. A guard was calling out to the inmates on a protruded balcony.</p>
<p>"<strong>Good morning, you snuffin' reprobates!</strong> Beautiful morning today. If only I could appreciate it. Didn't get much sleep." The inmates turned to the first floor, where a guard, perhaps the head of the guards, sniped. "Do you know why? Because the eclipse draws ever nearer!" Walking while he speak, "How many of you are getting made an example of on Hope's Rest <strong>this time</strong>? I can hardly contain myself thinking about it! Couldn't catch a wink of sleep last night, me!"</p>
<p>The group were still watching behind the blades, with Taion heated up, exclaiming softly, "Nutty snuffer... He's really enjoying this." The others gritted their teeth, hearing her elated tone.</p>
<p>Stopping below the wind duct where the group was, his tone getting excited, "Yet, nonetheless, <strong>the show must go on</strong>. In order to unite our hearts and minds. To keep the world in balance, in perfect harmony! This will be your <strong>final resting place</strong>. So why not <strong>live a little?</strong> While you still have some-<strong>'body' to enjoy it with</strong>! Hah hah hah hah!" Then, he leave.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Tch! I'll give <em>him</em> something to enjoy..."</p>
<p>Eunie blurted out, " What term is he even? Is not like he'll have that much longer than them to live! <strong>Ah... Bollocks...</strong>" She finished speaking before realizing Mio was beside her, reminding her of something uneasy.</p>
<p>"It's OK. I'm not bothered. <em>I hate people like that.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group found a hole covered by metal grids which they could jump down, which the space below was unguarded. Noah: "This is... a warehouse of some kind?" There were barrels beneath, but otherwise we couldn't determine other contents.</p>
<p>Taion: "According to the schematics, that's what it is. What do you think, Noah? There are no guards, so we should be able to proceed..."</p>
<p>"You're right, seems safe enough. Let's get down through here." He detached the latch on the metal, which it bounced downwards and around an axle.</p>
<p>Lanz was reminded of something, "Hold up. Shouldn't we be taking off our eyepatches? Far as I can tell, the people being held in here don't have them on."</p>
<p>Eunie already took action before they even discussed the possibility of being caught, "Makes sense."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group, including the candidates, walked into the central hall and saw two inmates were preparing for a fight while others stood around, either cheering or just watching. The prison guard watched closely; but since they hadn't started fighting, he did nothing except observations. The group looked around, until a brown-skin female, sitting on a table cross-legged, with two buff bodyguard standing beside her{{footnote: And two other inmates, one sitting, another standing, not worth mentioning.}}, called out for their attention, "The hell'd you come here for?"</p>
<p>Jansen: "Ghondor..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Is that... Ghondor?" Noah was looking at the two bodyguard, wondering which of those two were Ghondor, ignoring the one speaking.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "I asked you a question. Gimme an answer, fresh fish!" She had thick black hair, large dark-lime-green iris, thick eyelashes, wearing a necklace with sapphire crystal encased with metal-like objects attached to a red string in an undefined shape. She wore two rings bundled around her biceps and triceps, an armpit navy blue shirt, checkered dark-white long-sleeve pant, and some red scarf around her hands like the ones to protect it when boxing.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah just realized. So, a woman, huh... for the name...</p>
<p>"'Huh'? Cut the crap. Any lights on in there, you deadbrain?"</p>
<p>"Hold on... Is Ghondor a...?"</p>
<p>"Is Ghondor a what? Finish your damn sentence! What? My name?! You got a problem with it?!" Her tone surely wasn't friendly.</p>
<p>Mio: "So she's... Ghondor..."</p>
<p>"Bitchqueen... She musta thought she was being funny..."</p>
<p>"Eheh!" One of the inmates sitting down laughed out accidentally, unable to suppress anymore.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Oh, so you agree, do you?!" She stood up, about to punch him. The guy whom laughed out quickly stood up and goes into a surrender mode.</p>
<p>"N-no! I... It wasn't-! I didn't mean..." The two bodyguards looked away. "Arrrgh!" Ghondor jumped and kicked him in his face. He flew and smashed into a wall.</p>
<p>As she switched posture back into a cross-legged sitting position, her two bodyguards caught up with her, and she continued, "Go die in a ditch, you turd."</p>
<p>Sena was surprised, "Yikes. Never thought I'd hear someone top Eunie's sweary mouth..." Even Lanz's mouth was slightly opened.</p>
<p>Mio teased her, "Don't you go copying her, Sena."</p>
<p>"Nah... Not my style."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't impressed with the gossiping. "Oh wow. Way to talk trash about one of your friends..."</p>
<p>Ghondor took the stage, "So? Where was I?"</p>
<p>One of the bodyguard bent down beside her ears to remind her, "Think it was about... why they're here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, right, that. So, what's the idea, sweethearts?"</p>
<p>"Now she's playing nice?" Eunie wondered.</p>
<p>Noah: "You're... Ghondor?"</p>
<p>"What's it to you?"</p>
<p>"Monica from the City... She told us about you. She said you'd know where the Queens are."</p>
<p>"Tch... So you <em>are</em> the Bitchqueen's lapdogs."</p>
<p>"Please, tell us what you know." He cared more about the information than the complex relationship between Ghondor and Monica, and her furious feelings. "We have... good reason to meet with them. To bring peace... and to set the world to rights."</p>
<p>"This shit <strong>again</strong>."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm fed up with hearing the sanctimonious Ardun crap."</p>
<p>Lanz concluded, "So you aren't gonna help us out then."</p>
<p>"If you're trying to kill the now, then you can just forget it."</p>
<p>Taion: "Erm, kill the now?" (What 'now'?)</p>
<p>"Did I bloody stutter? Oh, you just don't get it? Maybe this'll hammer it home." She squint her eyes, about to share something big, maybe? "Aggy! Oggy!"</p>
<p>"Ma'am!" The two bodyguards lowered their hands from cross-hands position.</p>
<p>"At your command."</p>
<p>She stood up and gave commands, "Give this lot a bruising and dump 'em in the trash!"</p>
<p>"Ma'am! My pleasure!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Inmates gathered around behind barriers, watching Ghondor, Oggy, and Aggy enter the central stage from one side, while the Ouroboros group stood at the other side. They were cheering like those cheers you see in an ancient Roman colosseum fight. Then, they summoned their blades. Aggy and Oggy used a stick with lights on both ends, while Ghondor had two giant boxing-like fist.</p>
<hr />
<p>Their fight is running out of control. "Huh!" Alerted, the guard turned around and punched a red button on a wall. Immediately, an emergency siren filled the room.</p>
<p>The siren doesn't disturb their fight. "Hwaa!" Seeing Ghondor's approach, Lanz did a horizontal slash. She kicked him in his wrist, he lost his grip on the sword, and she landed a punch in his stomach. Before he could re-summon his sword, she jumped into the air ("Grrrraaaaahhh!!!") and landed a knee-slice on him, sending him dragging on the floor. "Urgh!"</p>
<p>Satisfied at his state, she turned to him, "Hah! I put all my love into that one for ya. Ya better appreciate it!" Just after, Noah and Mio managed to intersect between them. A sudden light from her chest attracted her attention, "<em>Wait, it's glowing...?</em>" She realized it's Noah whom caused it, "HUH!"</p>
<p>Slowly getting on his feet, he warned, "Urg, ungh... Careful. She packs a meaner punch than you'd think, Noah!" Aggy and Oggy draws the others' attention.</p>
<p>"Yeah... No jokes."</p>
<p>From behind, Jansen agreed, "'Course she does. She's a pro. That's Monica daughter for you." Shania stood slightly behind him, hands crossed, depressed as usual.</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh?</strong>" Mio was surprised at her relationship.</p>
<p>Noah: "Daughter...? You mean... That she was born from Monica? Like that baby we saw?"</p>
<p>Jansen: "That's about the size of it. Plus, the head Ouroboros candidate."</p>
<p>"Huh!" Shania was unwilling to accept that. The Ouroboros were surprised.</p>
<p>Taion: "That too?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "You don't say. It all adds up now."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Oi! What are ya prattling on about? You got something to say, say it to my face!"</p>
<p>Noah: "We do!"</p>
<p>"Go on then!"</p>
<p>"Why are we fighting each other? It's so pointless."</p>
<p>"Piss off, no it's not."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you dags haven't figured it out."</p>
<p>"About killing the now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then stop holding out, and just tell us!</strong>" Is this really the right place to say something when the guards probably can eavesdrop?</p>
<p>"Tch. <em>Set the world to rights</em>, you said."</p>
<p>"Yeah... I did."</p>
<p>"Not sure if you're just being self-righteous, but take a look around... Think about how many lives it's cost, running after that shit already!"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Their time to think is nigh. A group of guards came running towards the fighting ground. Ghondor sheathed her weapon, Aggy and Oggy followed.</p>
<p>One of them immediately shouted commands, "All right, that's enough! On your knees now, all of you! Hands behind your head! Disobey me, you'll get time in solitary!" The other surrounded them. They all had pike weapons.</p>
<p>Taion first sheathed his weapon, warned the others to do so, "Change of plan. Sheathe your Blades now! Let's... just do as he says, OK?"</p>
<p>"Mmm..." Mio agreed, and the rest followed. As for Riku and Manana, since their blades and cooking utensil can't be sheathed, they slid it towards the soldiers and put their wings on the ground. As Ghondor knelt down on the floor, the rest followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>They're not put in solitary. Indeed, back in their cells, which probably hosted 18-24 people with 3 to 4 rows of single-layer beds, the Ouroboros gathered around as Noah received communications on his iris.{{footnote: Let's forget about the few other inmates that also sit or stood around.}} "...OK, got it. Stay safe on your end too." After he closed off communication, he relayed the info to the others, "Jansen and the others are all in the same cell, it looks like."</p>
<p>Taion logically concluded, "If they didn't notice us coming in from the outside... I think we can call step one of the plan a success."</p>
<p>Mio, concerned with her hostility, "I wonder how we're supposed to get Ghondor to work with us..."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Yeah. The way she said we were <em>'trying to kill the now'</em>... Sounded like she might take some convincing."</p>
<p>Eunie crossed her arms, still don't understand, "Yeah, and what the spark does that even mean?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "I've no idea. But I think I want to ask Ghondor about it. Lots to talk about."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Talk? Dude, I'm not looking forward to raising a merry ruckus just to get out..."</p>
<p>The other inmates started walking out towards the central cell block. Riku, noticing the movements, commented, "That seem not strictly necessary."</p>
<p>Sena: "What d'you mean...?"</p>
<p>A Lost Numbers soldier walked pass them and gave the information they needed, "You're new around here, eh? If you don't stir yourself, you'll miss grub, you know." That's probably the limit of his kindness. He walked away without waiting for further questions nor replies.</p>
<p>Manana was flattered, "They even feed us?!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Well now. Seems we have more freedom than we initially assumed, here." Not confined within their cells all day long, huh...</p>
<p>Noah turned to the group, suggested, "Let's look for Ghondor."</p>
<hr />
<p>"I'll tell you what we should all do." Sitting down on the table, with Aggy and Oggy beside her, and other inmates roaming behind, in the central room. "<strong>Not. One. Friggin'. Thing.</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "We do nothing?"</p>
<p>"If we just stay put here, and the City folk keep a low profile, no one has to die for smalnuts."</p>
<p>Noah: "So that's your <em>'now'</em>?"</p>
<p>"Penny finally drops."</p>
<p>Lanz questioned, "Aren't they going to execute you next month?"</p>
<p>"So? It'll be 10 people, if that. They've got over a thousand locked up in here. It'll barely register."</p>
<p>"<strong>'SO'? Lives aren't statistics!</strong>" Taion shouted out.</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm saying if you stir shit like what Bitchqueen wants, you'll have a thousand lives</strong> on your conscience!" Noah breathed out quiveringly on her words. Adding to it, "And also... <em>You're</em> gonna set the world to rights? Then what's that there, on your arms? On your chests?" She got off the table and approached Mio, "And then there's the kitten... Little more than a month left?"</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"You must be the most eager of the lot."</p>
<p>"<strong>That's enough!</strong>" Noah sniped back, simultaneously launched himself towards her. After taking a step, Mio reacted immediately, putting on of her hand on his shoulder and look intimately into his eyes. Alas, his eyes was fixed on Ghondors'. Though, the touch from the person in concern was enough to make him took back a step.</p>
<p>She wasn't scared. "Hmph! <strong>Just shut up about the world already.</strong>" On the way back to her table, "All this holier-than-thou crap...{{footnote: She turned to Noah.}} You're only doing it for yourselves!"</p>
<p>"Hrrrr..." He gritted his teeth as his internal heart flared, her thought being stereotypicized and imposed on him.</p>
<p>"You just fight out of self-pity, flailing around thinking you can <strong>make a difference!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio had had enough, "Urgggh! <strong>When I see our lives... I do it with purpose!</strong>"{{footnote: Though, one thought she can bear herself being targeted, but if the one being targeted her de-facto partner.}}</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Just one more day... One more minute...</strong> <em>You've no idea how many lives we sent... All the friends we had... Wishing they'd had more time! That was each and every day for us!</em>" As if hope was lost, "<em>But it was all we could do. It was all we had to believe in... Day in, day out...</em>"</p>
<p>Ghondor questioned, "You are... an off-seer?" She nodded in return.</p>
<p>Looking up, recalling her moments in the City, "And when we finally made it to the City... I realized there was a whole different world out there. <em>'They're so lucky.'</em> I really thought that. I was astounded... <em>Just by extending our years, life could be so different?</em> I even saw the beginning of a new life...{{footnote: She held both her hands up, looking at them.}} That tiny little hand... <em>that was grasping mine...</em>{{footnote: Closing her eyes to retrieve the sense of touch from her memory.}} I can understand why you want to protect that.{{footnote: Clenching them into fists.}} If that's the 'now' you speak of, we'd never kill that.{{footnote: She turned to Ghondor, putting her hands into her appreciation stance.}} Still...! That's why! <strong>We're trying to protect it for you! To save our friends! <em>To build a future that would make us free!</em></strong>" The other inmates from afar were gathering sparsely around them, listening to their conversations.</p>
<p>The speech was touching, but she had her concerns, "You've got about a month. That enough? For that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. My time might be up... before our fight is truly over. There's... <em>probably not that much I can do.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>Her eyes unwavering, "But... <strong>I've got to try! <em>I'll keep trying... while my flame still flickers!</em></strong> And after that..." She turned to look at Noah, whom nodded back to her. She turned to each and every one in her group, till Lanz gave verbal replies, "Yeah... We gotcha. We'll carry on your will! Right, Noah?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I don't really want to imagine that. But... <strong><em>there's just no running away from it. All we can do is move forward. We have to.</em></strong> That day... Guernica entrusted us with this power. And because of that, we made friends with... former enemies." Turning to Ghondor, "Believe us. Your <em>'now'</em>... is safe with us. As is the future."</p>
<p>Her tone soften, "So, that's your argument?" He nodded in return.</p>
<p>"Urggh..." She walked towards him, took off her necklace, and handed it to him. She dropped it on his hand.</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"For the Cloudkeep.{{footnote: She turned and walked back to her table.}} Where the real Queen of Agnus is takin' her beauty sleep. You'll need that to get in. Kinda like a key."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>Sitting on the table, "This thing took a liking to... Uhhh... Names?"</p>
<p>"Noah."</p>
<p>"Mio."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Noah and Mio. I'll remember that.{{footnote: Yeah! The legendary N and M!}} Mm, anyways, the doodad{{footnote: the necklace.}} reacted to you two when you teamed up. I think... it was probably, like, telling me to give it to you."</p>
<p>Noah: "Thank you..."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're helping us now?"</p>
<p>"Still hate the fact that Bitchqueen sent you. But hey, the wossname did pick you, so. And I did promise."</p>
<p>Noah: "Promise?"</p>
<p>"In three days, Agnus will be holding a large-scale training exercise on Daedal Isle. Of course, that means minimal security for us. That'll be our chance to escape."</p>
<p>"How, then?"</p>
<p>"Hehe... <strong>Well, the only way I know how.{{footnote: Turning to the other loosely-gathered Lost Numbers.}} Am I right?! Ya dags!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" The Lost Numbers chanted in unison, turned into their fighting pose, never so readied.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>I've... got a bad feeling about this.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie seconded, "Yeah. The proverbial's gonna hit the fan."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Them's the breaks. Take it or leave it."</p>
<p>Noah, in a robot-like voice, "All right. In three days."</p>
<p>"Just do some prison things until then. Oh, uh... Just try to keep in line, would ya? We don't wanna draw attention."</p>
<p>"We'll keep that in mind."</p>
<p>"Oh, and... a quick word of advice."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"<strong>When all is lost, let 'em hear you roar.</strong>{{footnote: The spark, one don't understand.}} Got that?"</p>
<p>"Hear us... roar?"</p>
<p>"All that power you wield? That's exactly what it was meant for."</p>
<hr />
<p>Before dismissing the group, she'd dismissed the other Lost Numbers, including her two bodyguards. "We're done today. Scuttle back to your hole, you rat bastards. If we keep crowding together like this, a nice Mr. Jailer might show up and rattle your empty heads together."</p>
<p>Noah: "No worries, we'll clear out."</p>
<p>"Ah, before you go, just one more word to the wise... If you're gonna pretend to be model prisoners, you'd better put some effort into the jobs the guards give you."</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "What kinds of jobs are they?"</p>
<p>"Hmm. It's different depending on the day. Anyway, come here again in the morning."</p>
<p>Noah: "We'll be here."</p>
<p>Manana cryingly complaint, "We have to wake up early?" Yeah, the only Nopon whom needs Riku to shake her up every time the sun caressed her bum bum.</p>
<p>Sena tried encouraging, "Looks that way, sweetie."</p>
<p>Riku adviced, "Noah, would be good idea to sleep early today. Early to sleeping, early to waking."</p>
<p>"Right." They head back to their cells immediately thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="day-1"><a class="header" href="#day-1">Day 1</a></h3>
<p>By the innermost side of the cell, Taion speaking to Noah, Eunie speaking to Riku, Manana with Mio. Outside, beyond their hearing range, stood Lanz with his arms crossed, looking down, back against the wall, and Sena beside him, both palms on her pelvis, also looking down.</p>
<p>"I'm envious."</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"You... Mimi... Noah... You're all so incredibly confident..."</p>
<p>"Who's confident? It's all... a big act. I don't know about Noah and Mio... But me, though? <em>I'm pathetic.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" That was surprising, not like what he'd been acting out.{{footnote: She turned to look at him, prompting for more.}}</p>
<p>"I'm just acting tough. To pump myself up like I'm not a wimp."</p>
<p>"You think you're... a wimp?"{{footnote: Looking back down.}}</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm a lot... like you."{{footnote: Turning to look at her.}}</p>
<p>"Huh?" More surprises. She turned to meet his eyes, but he turned away at the last moment, avoiding such direct intimacy.</p>
<p>"But, look... What's wrong with that anyway? If we're weak... there's room to grow. <strong>Right?</strong>" His eyes met hers.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>To be more attentive, he stop leaning against the wall and turned his chest facing her, "Remember the first time you became Ouroboros? You yelled, <em>'Lanz! Come with me!'</em>, ah?"</p>
<p>"Mm..." She nodded.</p>
<p>"<strong><em>You reached out... for the strength you needed.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Ooh..."</p>
<p>{{footnote: Back to initial pose.}}"Our friend Joran... He became Moebius. <em>But that... That wasn't him</em>. <strong>That's his life's purpose? Like spark it is.</strong> So I think... Maybe... <em>I wanna figure out the purpose of my own life. I wanna get stronger.{{footnote: Looking up, as if to reminisce.}} And if Joran's surpassed me... I'll get even stronger than that</em>."</p>
<p>"Oh wow..."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>I won't be doing it for the recognition. Nor to be liked. I'll do it for myself.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Even if people don't recognize it? Right?"</p>
<p>He met her eyes with an unwavering look, "We're here. This is us. Let's keep being true to ourselves. <em>What's wrong with that?</em>"</p>
<p>"Same old... Lanz?"</p>
<p>"Same old... Sena." She turned away and recalled what Mio said years ago,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never stop being you, 'Kay?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Recognizing your own purpose... Huh.{{footnote: Turning her attention back to him, (and asking for permission).}} You mind if I... pinch that mindset?"</p>
<p>"<em>Whatcha talking about? Friends don't need to ask.</em>"</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, "<strong>Huh?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Hahahahaha!"</p>
<p>"Hah hahahaha! Here's to us. <strong>The mighty weaklings!</strong>"</p>
<p>Her tone upbeat, "Yeah!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena and Lanz joined the cell, and the group gathered around, with Noah asking, "Is everyone ready?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh yeah."</p>
<p>Mio: "Ghondor told us to go to the central cell block."</p>
<p>Taion: "It's about the same time now as it was when we infiltrated the prison..."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't looking to see someone, "Ugh, what if that foul-mouthed jailer's there...?"</p>
<p>"He'll no doubt be at the morning gathering." To which Eunie just dropped her head in disappointment.</p>
<p>Lanz turned around with Noah, "OK then. Shall we go, my fellow model prisoners?"</p>
<p>Sena showed her muscles, "Good luck at hard labor, everyone!"</p>
<p>Eunie complaint, "Ugh, hope we get off lightly..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathered in the central cell with the rest of the jailed Lost Numbers, two guards approached a central balcony, and one of them, the prison warden{{footnote: Probably the foul-mouthed guy.}}, announced, "Good morning, prisoners! How are you this fine morning? It's a good day to show gratitude to your jailers! We let you keep your criminal lives, least you can do is work till you die! Them wot don't work, don't eat! And so, without further ado, here's your work details for today." He wore a taller horned helmet of diamond shape above his forehead than the other guards, just to differentiate who's who.</p>
<p>The prison guard took over the stage, announcing, "Today's food-gathering duty is in the Perimeter Woodland. You're to team up based on your assigned cell. First, gather 20 each of Carnomiles, Gold Burdocks, Peachy Truffles, and Honey Plums. That is all." Sounds laborious huh, collecting 80 items.</p>
<p>The group listened around for complaints, but was met with a relieve from Anton, a guy speaking near them to another guy beside him, "Phew, sounds like another breezy one today!"</p>
<p>Cory replied, "Oh, for sure. Might even be able to sneak in a napperoo, dontcha think?"</p>
<p>Eunie stopped eavesdropping. "Bleh... Seems plenty rough to me."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed. "Same. I don't even wanna think what a hard day's work looks like here..."</p>
<p>Mio noticed Taion got into analyzing mode, hence prompted, "Something wrong, Taion?"</p>
<p>"Those foodstuffs that the guard named... It's the exact same food that the Castle distributes to us."</p>
<p>Sena raised a hypothesis, "Hey, does that mean... The food the colonies receive, it's all picked here?!"</p>
<p>"It would be the natural conclusion..."</p>
<p>Noah: "So they're using the Lost Numbers as free labor..." Mio got into her appreciative stance, appreciated their hard work.</p>
<p>The prison guard continued, "We're now opening the gate to the Perimeter Woodland." A gated bar to the prisoner's "right"{{footnote: Applicable only to those facing the guard.}} opened up via some hidden mechanism, revealing an alleyway leading towards bright sunlight. He continued, "And no funny business, you hear me? Anyone acts suspicious, they get taken out. End of."</p>
<p>Mio reminded Noah, "We're supposed to keep our heads down until we can execute the plan..."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Let's just head for the woodland." They followed the other Lost Numbers, making their way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>After collecting, the group approached a prison guard, Noah called out, "We've collected our quota."</p>
<p>He nodded, "Let me be the judge of that." He agreed after counting, "All right then, here's the list for the next batch..."</p>
<p>Lanz was shocked, "Wha-?! We worked our arses off, and now you want more?!"</p>
<p>"You got a problem with that? Feel free to die if you prefer. We're keeping you alive outta the goodness of our bleedin' hearts. You wanna stay that way, you work."</p>
<p>Lanz squinted his eyes, prepared to launch at him, "What did you just-" He took steps forward, but Noah stopped him, speaking softly to remind him of their objective,</p>
<p>"Hey, we need to lay low until... you know."</p>
<hr />
<p>After another batch, the guard: "Right, that'll do it. Work's over for today. Back to your cells, you animals." He then walked away, and the group entered the alleyway towards the prison.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the alleyway junction connecting the cells to the central room, Eunie complaint, "Eugh... I stink of dirt..." No showers, huh!</p>
<p>Sena encouraged, "We gotta stay patient. Just two more days."</p>
<p>Mio connected, "It's inconceivable... All the people here have had to work like this every day...?"</p>
<p>Taion logically concluded, "They're being seen as expendable labor. I imagine the overseers don't even consider them human."</p>
<p>Noah considered and thought over the conversations for a while, but concluded that there's nothing he or they could immediately do to ease their situation, hence he reminded, "We need to keep our strength up for tomorrow. Time to call it a night."</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah. You're right."</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="day-2"><a class="header" href="#day-2">Day 2</a></h3>
<p>Gathered in a circle inside their cell, Mio called out, "Good morning. Everything's ready."</p>
<p>Noah: "Then let's get to the central cell block."</p>
<p>Eunie, with an tempered tone, "Let's all give our best to the ol' penal colony again today, mateys."</p>
<p>Sena: "Hahahah..."</p>
<p>Lanz noted, "That Ghondor certainly enjoys skiving off, considering how insistent she was that we keep our heads down."</p>
<p>Taion: "Actually, if I recall correctly, she said to 'pretend to be model prisoners'."</p>
<p>Noah: "Whatever we do, we have one more day of it." They all agreed and made their way for the central block.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the final group arrived, the prison guard{{footnote: with the warden standing beside him, hands crossed,}} gave his words: "The job today is culling the Feris population living in the Perimeter Woodland." The prisoners nodded at each other before the guard continued, "Anyone who kills a Feris will be excused from other duties for the rest of the day. Make sure to bring proof when reporting in. Not just any Feris, though! The idea is to eradicate the ones that are going berserk."</p>
<p>Lanz was upbeat, "Well, that's much more like it! No more digging in the dirt like yesterday."</p>
<p>"The Ferises are reported to have mauled a large number of people yesterday. Have fun out there!"</p>
<p>Dana questioned the guard, "Why don't you use your Levnises? It'd make quick work of them."</p>
<p>"Any units assigned here are being prepared for the war games tomorrow. Even if they weren't, why bother wheeling out the big guns for something this trivial? Especially when we've got you lot." Expected but sad. "Now get out there -- the day's a-wasting. Anyone found disobeying orders will be terminated on sight!" They took off for the alleyway.</p>
<p>Eunie: "He sounded pretty gleeful about that, don't you think?" The Ouroboros hadn't yet moved their buttocks, dropping behind the others.</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Gleeful's the word, yeah. All he's gonna have to do is sit back and enjoy the show while we're out there, fighting crazed Ferises."</p>
<p>Taion: "I cannot understand how one can derive any pleasure from such a cruel pastime..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Still, we ought to move out." They trailed behind the last group to exit the alleyway thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor, Aggy, and Oggy were fighting a crazed Feris when Noah called out to them, "Ghondor!" The group joined beside them.</p>
<p>"Huh?! Oh, it's you dags... I thought I told you to keep a low profile? Go on, get outta here!"</p>
<p>Mio disagreed, "You won't get rid of us that easily."</p>
<p>"Pah, suit yourselves. Then let's at least make it quick."</p>
<p>Noah: "Not a problem." They drew their blades and joined the fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway, the crazed Feris, seeing that it can't win, turned around and ran off. Lanz was surprised at its sudden clearheadedness, "Huh?! Oi, stop right there!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Fast legs on that one."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Don't sound so impressed."</p>
<p>Taion first sheathed his blade, "We lost it, huh...?"</p>
<p>The others followed sheathing their blades, with Noah giving instruction, "We better run after it." {{footnote: There were some tame pink deer behind, but let's forget about it.}} Sena didn't make a move, concerned about the few injured Lost Numbers lying or sitting on the ground beside her. She questioned,</p>
<p>"Uhm, what about these folks here...?"</p>
<p>Ghondor kept her emotions behind bars, "I'm touched by your concern, but they're experienced soldiers, all right?"</p>
<p>"But...!" Ghondor can't believe her persistence. She walked towards the soldiers and shout out, hoping to incite efficiency and progress in them,</p>
<p>"C'mon, you lousy grunts! You gonna keel over from tiny scratches like that?! Pathetic! You get up right now, or so help me, I'll tear you limb from limb and feed you to the Ferises my-bloody-self."</p>
<p>Anton: "Urk..." They tried, but failed. Words can't soothed the physical pain, what says healing it.</p>
<p>"Lazy gits, I swear..." Turning to the group, "I'll pile 'em up somewhere outta the way, then I'll come find you. Go on ahead now. Don't waste the head-start."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with the job-splitting, "... As you say."</p>
<hr />
<p>The Ouroboros themselves quickly caught up with the Feris near the fenced perimeter corner. Sena: "We caught up with it."</p>
<p>Summoning their blades, Noah instructed, "Good. Now let's take it out before it hurts anyone else!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As the Feris turned into blue moats, they sheathed their blades and Eunie sighed with relief, "Phew... We took it down somehow."</p>
<p>Lanz: "They sure don't mess about with the work detail here..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Our duty is accomplished... What now?"</p>
<p>Noah: "We should probably go report it, but-" Maybe the guards may gave them a second round if they go in too early? Or maybe, its shameful to assume they kill it themselves without Ghondor's help.</p>
<p>Just then, Ghondor, Oggy, and Aggy ran and caught up with them, with Ghondor being surprised at their speed, "Oh, what? You already took it out? But I barely got to go nuts yet!"</p>
<p>Mio: "'Go nuts'...? You really have a taste for battle..." Eunie couldn't have agreed more.</p>
<p>"Ah well, what's done is done. You dags better hop to it and report to the guard."</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Sure I'm sure. You earned it, didn't ya?" Turning to the fences, she noted, "Anyhow, since there's not a lot of attention on this place, we'll take a look around and scope things out for tomorrow."</p>
<p>"All right, if that's how you want to play it..." Ghondor leaves the Ouroboros to report in while they check things out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Approaching the guard, Noah spoke for the group, "We've defeated a Feris that had gone wild."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have, have you? Where's the proof?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Here you go, the thing's horns."</p>
<p>He shook his head in disagreement, "Pfft, you coulda taken that from any old Feris. It won't count as proof for me." Here he goes again, as expected!</p>
<p>"You wot...!"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group gathered in the central cell block to discuss, "What the ever-snuffing sparks? That guy really gets on my wings..."</p>
<p>Noah, intending to keep his profile down, "Nothing to be done. Let's go back and look for something that'll convince him."</p>
<p>Lanz was unsatisfied, "Ugh... More walking? Great..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Re-entering the Perimeter Woodlands, the Ouroboros clashed with Ghondor and the two, with Noah calling out, "Oh, you're done already?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much. More importantly, what are you lot doing out here?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Let me explain..."</p>
<p>"Well, sure sounds like that guard gets off on messing with you guys... Take these." She handed them a Giant Feris Horn.</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh...?"</p>
<p>"You give him those, even he'll have to leave ya alone." Oh yeah, <em>giant</em> is the key to strength, to fear, to intimidate!</p>
<p>Mio: "Thanks for that." The group re-entered and approached the guard.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah: "Here, proof that we did what we said."</p>
<p>"Hrmm... Well I'll be{{footnote: Is it "Well it'll be" instead? One double checked, but the words are correct. Perhaps they had a typo? "I'll" used here seems to have no special meaning, nor special relations.}}. It looks like you really did take down that Feris. I'm a man of my word. You're relieved of duties for the rest of today." He then walked off while Ghondor and the two approached the group from behind.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you did well."</p>
<p>They turned to face them, with Noah appreciating for the group, "Thanks for the help, Ghondor."</p>
<p>"Don't even mention it. Besides, I also wanted time to talk about tomorrow."</p>
<p>Taion agreed: "Good point. I do want us to go over the details together." They went and get around a table.</p>
<hr />
<p>===</p>
<p>"We make our move at 0800, right after outdoor duties start. My men will cause a commotion outside, draw out the guards and jailers. The guards will be armed, so you dags will need to deal with them. Use the element of surprise."{{footnote: As usual, she sat at the table, and the surrounding was empty, presumably the others haven't completed their task of the day yet.}}</p>
<p>Noah concernedly questioned, "And the jailers?"</p>
<p>"They're small fry. I'll take care of 'em."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>Lanz: "How many guards?"</p>
<p>"'Bout 30. Take out 20 or so and we'll be sitting pretty. Then, we break straight through the west gate. We'll have you lot covered, so just run for it."</p>
<p>Taion: "And how do we <em>'break through it'</em>? It's not like it's made of tissue..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Surely you lot can handle a gate?</strong>{{footnote: Bro, manager gives you the direction, the why, you'll have to think of the 'how' yourself hahah!}} Why else would the Bitchqueen even send you?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Why do you keep calling Monica that? She's your mother!"</p>
<p>Her emotions roused high, "<strong>I'll call her whatever the hell I like!</strong> Anyways, you all got the gist of the plan now?"</p>
<p>Taion, scrupulous as usual, "You call that a plan? There's nothing to get. We don't even have any contingency measures, do we?"</p>
<p>"Tch. I bet you're fun at parties. Arsehat..."</p>
<p>To which he just softly replied, "I'd prefer 'level-headed', thank you."</p>
<p>Standing up, "Anyhow... We'll gather in front of Watchtower 1. After breaching the gate, thin out. You run and you don't look back. Clear?"</p>
<p>Noah: "OK. We'll do that."</p>
<p>"Good. You're dismissed!"</p>
<p>The group turned and leave, while Noah had last words, "Ghondor!"</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"Please, just.. just be careful."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ahah!</strong> Who d'you think you're talking to?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The two group descended the staircase towards the junction leading to their cells. Ghondor was walking beside Sena, asking her, "You look like you'd make short work of that gate."</p>
<p>"Huh, me?"</p>
<p>"That wallop of yours on the first day. One helluva hit. You sure give 'em a run for their money! Haha!"</p>
<p>"Ah, thanks a lot..."</p>
<p>"Looks like someone's raring to go." Shania had her backs on the metal gate that separated the guard's sector and the prisoner's sector, calling out as the two passed.</p>
<p>The two stopped and had their attention on her, "Shania!"</p>
<p>Ghondor, folding her hands around her chest, "Well, look what the Hox dragged in."</p>
<p>She took steps towards the two, her voice full of jealousy and confidence as she spit her words out, "Nice to see you too, Ghondor. I've been here the whole time. You didn't notice?"</p>
<p>"Oh I'm sorry, want a medal?"</p>
<p>"Ugh... Arrogant as ever."</p>
<p>"Anyway... Think you're ready for this?"</p>
<p>"<em>'Who d'you think you're talking to?'</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Oooh, touchy</em>. <strong>Just don't screw this up!</strong>" Ghondor then leaves the two behind. Sena ran after her while Shania watched them leave.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" Their cold wars was outwardly displayed.</p>
<p>The others were far ahead, the two didn't catch up. Sena had to ask, "You and Shania were... 'friends from the crib', was that it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, since we were kids."</p>
<p>"I didn't realize."</p>
<p>"Chick didn't know when to stop following me around. Had it up to my ears with her."</p>
<h5 id="start-of-ghondors-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-ghondors-memories">Start of Ghondor's Memories</a></h5>
<p>In the Memorial Hall, in front of one of the statue, Ghondor, her hands folded, spoke to Shania, her heads down. "Heard you bombed the selection test. And not for the first time."</p>
<p>With a crying tone, "<em>Yeah... I couldn't win, in the last round.</em>"</p>
<p>"Why'd you use the cestus?" These are the gloves that had 4 cyan-light bars in front of them, which we'd seen in Keves training camp lots of chapter ago. "You can barely throw a punch, makes no sense."</p>
<p>"Because... I thought if I used <em>your</em> weapon, I could capture a bit of the <em>Ghondor spirit</em>..."</p>
<p>She got furious at her, "<strong>You know that name pisses me off!</strong> And more excuses, eh? <strong>Stop <em>copying</em> me.</strong> You're even wearing my gloves now?" That refers to the gauntlet she had on her hands, of the same red color, each ended on the crest of the fingers on one end, and the elbow on the other."Right! Enough is enough."</p>
<p>Her teeth gritted, didn't get the praise nor the cheer she needed. Her palm clenched into a fist. Ghondor kept waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>"Nothing to say for yourself? <strong>Ugh, Peng on a Levnis! Don't you have any originality? It's no wonder you lost. No wonder you never get picked.</strong>" She didn't even raise her head.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-ghondors-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-ghondors-memories">End of Ghondor's Memories</a></h5>
<p>"I have my style. She has hers. Why doesn't she get the message? I'm so sick of it!"</p>
<p>"Hey, now..."</p>
<p>As Shania watched the two leaves, a male (probably a Lost Numbers), his face outside the camera's range, approached from behind Shania and asked softly, "They seem confident... Are we OK?"</p>
<p>"Everything' going to plan. Everything's fine. <strong><em>Everything...</em></strong>"</p>
