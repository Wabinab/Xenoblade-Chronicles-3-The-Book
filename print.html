<p>What evoke one to translate the video into a book, is perhaps an urge. Life is hard. 2023-4 was a little eventful, plus a lot of emotions. And from the rise and fall of emotions, one would like someone to walk by my side, but one don't know yet how; and if one know, if one could muster the courage to do it. In the moment of learning more and more from reading more and more books and linking knowledge together for application, one had a proxy to guide one, when life was still. Or at the very least, to fill in the time where one do not want to do anything else. And so starts the translating that, little by little, took more than half a year to complete. In the process, the journey of the protagonist walks alongside the journey one walks in this real world. Together, hand in hand, we aim for our destiny.</p>
<p>One used the word "translator" to signify oneself. Initially, one uses "writer", meaning "someone who writes". But the definition one suggested for the word 'writer' might be confused by readers whom does not read this paragraph, and consider 'writer' = 'author'. Searching through the writing world, one came across some non-English books being <em>translated</em> into English, and they called themselves "translated by" (and hence "translator"). They translate from one language to another. Isn't that the job of one? To translate a video cutscene into words; that's also a translation! Therefore, one'll refer to oneself as "translator" when one make notes here and there.</p>
<p>Ever since 2021, one had written a lot of blogs, but most of them are about one's feelings, one's learnings (work and non-work), and basically, non-fiction. This is the first time one touches anything fiction; and to be honest, it's <strong>really hard</strong>. The method of writing non-fiction and the method of writing fiction, even if one's just translating, is totally different. For a non-fiction that does not include philosophy, the difficulty came from verifying the facts -- the researches from hundreds to thousands of sites can make you eat a headache painkiller every day as your eyes multitask to syntopically read through text here and there. Luckily, most non-fiction one writes on one's blog are philosophical, so one uses one's experience and opinions as a basis to write about, throwing away most nerve-wracking researches and ask the reader to actively proof that one is wrong themselves instead (passing the buck/responsibility, eh!). But the difficulty of fiction is different -- for words, words that are bland and straight and all looking the same, trying to express emotions, is futile. Honestly speaking, they cannot replace the variation of "sound" that more easily expresses emotions. That the author and playwright of some wonderful plays and fictions, to one, is not something one could copycat -- they're too excellent one cannot.</p>
<p>So, in the writing ahead, you'd see that the writings one did improve with chapters. One initially started bland conversations, and try to fill in the pause with descriptions and explanations and whatever one can notice on the screen. This section had greatly improved one's observation skills -- when combined with books like <em>Outside Lies Magic</em> by John Stilgoe, and <em>Wanderlust</em> by Rebecca Solnit -- now one can notice things one don't see. Then, as writing proceeds, one focused more on expressing the emotional parts, dropping most of the "watery words" (explanations and descriptions to add more to word cound but makes the reader felt, 'all these have no meaning, it's just there to fill the space and increase the no. of word count' stuffs). Of course, there are still some, just less dramatic, and if it's only purely conversations, why do one even translate it? Everyone can hear what's being spoken! One also have difficulty refraining from explaining some emotions from one's point of view, unfortunately. Towards the end, that was less -- for one thought more on letting the reader interpret the emotions more by themselves. But on the beginning, one'll state it clearly how one perceived such emotions. Also at the back, after some experientation, one finally manage to adapt a range of loudness, from "<em>soft</em>", to "normal", to "<strong>loud</strong>", to "<strong>DESPERATE</strong>". Different people have different baseline, and actually, they don't just have 4 classification. In fact, one don't know how to do "<em>very soft</em>". More confusingly, the italics and bold are solely adapted to loudness. When the person speaks in their heart/brain, one'd encase it "<em>in italics, to signify thinking in their brain.</em>" Then, when one want to emphasize some "<em>soft desperate</em>", one unfortunately also uses italics. Markdown isn't integrated with "underlining" feature; perhaps there's an extension/library one could use to make it happen, but one didn't. So, reader might have a hard time trying to immediately understand. In all case, feel free to compare it to the actual video and you'd experience something of a more fuller sense than this book, purely in words.</p>
<p>Now that the road had come to the end for one, it's time for <em>you</em> to start your road, to walk alongside the characters in the story, and intertwine your feelings with them. Read on!</p>
<p>Note: the actual main storyline isn't exactly as below. In fact, one added some extra stuffs (like the Side Stories, and some others, which one'll notify you at the start of the page that it's added in) that <em>feels</em> like it belongs there. Those that cannot belong will either be added at random, or added in the More About. Some of the stories in More About assumed you have a previous knowledge of another story. One had been careful to remind you the need, but one isn't perfect, hence one can't know all. In any case, <a href="https://github.com/Wabinab/Xenoblade-Chronicles-3-The-Book/discussions/1">post them on the discussions on GitHub</a> and one'll check.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="prologue"><a class="header" href="#prologue">Prologue</a></h1>
<p>Tick, tock. Tick, tock. It was one minute to 6 in the evening. The sky emanates a red-orange hue. Lights were already on. The city square was busy.</p>
<p>A little girl with wings on the back of her head was running and jumping, pushing and shoving through the crowd. She was clearly on her way, not noticing even when stepped on a puddle. A while later, she turned to her back, waiving to her friends: "Come on! Hurry up! The Queen's anniversary is going to start without us, guys!"</p>
<p>A grey-skin boy was tailing behind closely, acknowledged immediately, "Yeah, move your feet! Hop hop! Run like you mean it!" and continue running behind the girl.</p>
<p>Two other boys, one thin, another chubby, was panting trying to catch up with the two. "Slow down, guys!" The fat boy, green haired, his hair so long his right eye was covered, had to push himself others on the side for someone his size to tune his direction while passing between the crowds. Nonetheless, we could see his eyes lighting up, asking, "Is it true, though, there's gonna be fireworks!"</p>
<p>The third boy, long hair tied to a pony tail, stopped and turned for a moment to look at him before continue running, while replying, "yeah, saw them setting up yesterday. There were loads of them. It'll be worth it. Promise!"</p>
<p>As soon as he finished his sentence, everyone looked up into the night sky. The sound of fireworks shooting up in the distant. To his right, fireworks had already launched while they were still running. It was too late. He stopped and looked at it. The fat boy slowly catching up to him.</p>
<p>"Ahahah" The distant sounds of children splashing at each other while laughing in the square's fountain. The winged girl arrived at the square first, the grey-skin boy followed. She turned to her back and wave to the other 2 guys, as if saying, "over here!"</p>
<p>The fat boy dashed past the pony-tail boy without turning his head to look at him while waving his hand back. Awestruck, the pony-tail boy was slow to react, and followed a second later. The girl and the grey-skin boy, assured that they didn't fall behind, continue to lead their way.</p>
<p>Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Tick, tock. Time didn't wait for them. The cranking sound of the mechanical clock continues. The long hand struck zero, and it's officially 6 p.m when pigeons were flying around, the pony-tail boy was still running, and time suddenly stop.</p>
<p>He slowed down to a walk. He looked around, surprised everything around him came to a stop. Pigeons stretching their wings defy Newton's 2nd law, stopping in mid air. People froze in their position. Water droplets float. The pony-tail boy was the only person who could move at that moment. Something abnormal is happening, he thought. The sound of the mechanical clock continued ticking. Yet even his 3 friends, smiling and waving back at him, were frozen. 'Not good. This isn't real.' He closed his eyes, hoping that everything will return to normal. He opened his eyes. No, nothing changed.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a large, dark patch of shadow falls within the glimpse of his vision. He turned back and looked up in the sky. A really large object, a planet, cast upon the red-orange hue, filling up more and more of the remaining sky as it moves toward him. Its shadow blocks the remaining light shining upon the town. With his eyes and jaws wide, blackout.</p>
<hr />
<p>Seen from space, two planets, one emanating yellow globules of energy, another blue, attracted towards one another, forming strides that closely resembles magnetic field lines when two magnets, North and South Pole, point towards each other. As the planets moved closer to each other, collision was inevitable. A large burst of greenish energy was released upon contact, light released so bright that the nearby space whiteout.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the surface of a planet (perhaps the remnants of the collision? We don't know), overlooking a mountain the shape of an animal's head. A snow-capped mountain the shape of an animal's head stood out against the clear blue sky. Amid peace, a globule of energy emerged from inexistent slightly right of the mountain's center line, expanded quickly, and swallowed a hole in it. The mountain was split in half. As the energy vanished, stones were sent circulating around the point of impact, while a shockwave gust through our point of vision. Turning our attention to the flat plains, more energy globules appear and disappear, carving crevasses like children making drawings out of snow.</p>
<p>Moving past these events, the green flat plains were replaced with black soil. Dust particles filled the air, blocking the lights. We can hear distant roar and shouts. As we get closer, we see large humanoid machines with wheels moving forward. Beam weapons, guns and cannons were firing at each other. The largest of the machines roll behind, and is the only machine not equip with any weapon as far as one can tell. Instead, a clocklike structure that looks like a gauge containing blue flames roaring within seems to play an important role. Let's call it the <strong>flame clock.</strong> Currently, it's one-third full.</p>
<p>What does the narratives tell us:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two colossal marshal nations locked in war. Keves and Agnus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are 2 nations, differentiated by colors. So far, we spoke about the <em>blue</em> nation, they're Keves. Agnus shone with a <em>yellow-green</em> hue. The standard melee weapon for Keves is a single broadsword, while Agnus are seen holding 2 thin katana-shaped sword. Even the humanoid machines were different. We described Keves with their wheels; while Agnus floats its torso above a ball bearing, signifying higher technology than Keves.</p>
<p>An Agnus soldier fall onto the ground, his helmet roll to the side. He look up, gasping, as if he hadn't had enough of life. His hand raised mid air, but to no avail. With his eyes opened, he died. A few seconds later, his corpse dried up really quickly, as if he'd turn into a stone, as if, he seen Medusa. More red particles float out of his corpse into the sky. As many of his kind, Keves or Agnus, died, more and more red particles filled the air, and the direction of their travel? The flame clock. The red particles replenished the gauge, now already at half full.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do we need to survive? Water? ... But what we need most, is life itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking into the right eyes retina of the soldiers, we saw a reflection of the flame clock. It seems that they're no longer in control of their own body. They got braver, marching towards the enemy disregarding their lives. They got stronger, slicing through enemies like harvesting wheat.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Taken the flames, becoming your own, in turn.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Agnus, seeing the bravery of Keves soldiers, decide for a tactical retreat. The war machines fill the places of soldiers, aiming their cannon at Keves' soldiers, ready to fire. The Keves' soldier knows what would happen next, turned their back and ran for their lives. Alas, it's too late. Many beams of yellow-green hue slice through the ground where they were, wiping left to right, taking lives wherever the beam swiped. It proved tactical, as Agnus soldiers rushed to fill the empty space, while thrusting their sword and firing their guns at the Keves who had their back facing them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the others, the one whose essence is stolen, leaves only a husk.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There was a red-suit humanoid figure standing atop the shoulder of the flame clock machine, though we don't have a closer look yet to who they are. Perhaps the manager?</p>
<p>Keves wasn't giving up. A commander standing around the bottom of the flame clock machine, surrounded by soldiers facing their gun towards the field, shouted into his bluetooth:</p>
<p>"Bombardier. What are you playing at? How can we claim their life if you blow up the whole sparking thing?! Cripple them! Aim lower!"</p>
<p>"Y-yessir! Lowering aim, sir!" We cannot be sure what machine a bombardier is controlling, yet we know it's equipped with a weapon, aiming at the belly of Agnus' flame clock machine. Few seconds after a shot is fired, it ripped through the belly, shaking its support. The hands of the machine, attached perhaps by visible electromagnetic beam, went off, and one of its arms came smashing down to the ground. The loss proved vital, as Keves' flame clock now draws more red particles than Agnus'. Defeat isn't near, but not far either.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fighting in order to live, and living to fight. That's the way of our world, Aionios.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Enough with the faceless. A group of young adult marching towards their enemies, one with a pony tail, thin, moderately tall; another grey-skin, very tall, very buff and muscular; a woman with two short wings behind her head, slim; and a short egglike creature, their face features on their green torso, very short legs, hands that resembles wings, we'll call them <strong>"Nopon"</strong>. Countless of faceless soldiers followed their lead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because slowly but surely, our world is now dying. Even though, we have yet to realize that fate.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the right eye of the pony-tail guy, we could see his flame clock iris turning yellow. From his vision, an interface appeared, with some information at both sides, the flame clock gauge on the lower left. When he focuses his attention, a sword-like blade floats into his center of focus, and a moment later, the same blade materialize in his hand. Others also summoned their weapons.</p>
<p>He swooshed and slashed, cutting grass... ahem... cutting through a few Agnus soldiers, before finally raising his weapon in front of his head to block an attack from an enemy. He caught a glimpse of the grey-skin guy suffering a blow from an Agnus soldier.</p>
<p><strong>"Lanz,"</strong> he called out.</p>
<p>Lanz, finishing off his enemy, turned back and looked at him, "Worry about yourself, <strong>Noah</strong>. There's still more of them."</p>
<p>(As if he needs to explain) "Even so, urg..." The strength of Noah's enemy became unbearable, breaking his defence. He thrust his hand forward, pushing the enemy off balance. Before he could finish him off, someone behind the Agnus soldier fired at him/her, finishing him/her off. He didn't stop, turning his attention and his aim at another soldier, while shouting back at Noah and Lanz, "Shut it! Stop flapping your gums and move."</p>
<p>The winged girl's blade was a long stick, with one end a cannon opening, another end looks like the blade of ceiling fan that rotates. She called out, "Yeah, we got more incoming."</p>
<p>Seems like Noah agreed it's not the right time for explanations. He turned his back while others joined him in a triangular position. Together, they face the hoards of Agnus soldiers running towards them, while they got into fighting stance.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Several minutes later, after laying their enemies down)</p>
<p>Noah and his team looked at the front line. Agnus' war machines were rolling in from the flanks, firing their cannons at Keves' war machines. They managed to lay a few down before the Keves' reacted. Noah shouting to Lanz: "They outflanked us?! Lanz, The front line!"</p>
<p>Lanz aligned his gaze with Noah's. "That Trish's team?" Then, turned to his back to face the winged girl, "<strong>Eunie</strong>, How're things with Kite? What about our backup?"</p>
<p>Eunie, standing beside the green Nopon, both turned and face another direction. Soldiers and war machines, both Agnus and Keves, were exchanging shots. She replied, "Looks like they were busy guarding the artillery. They're not goin' anywhere." After concluding, she turned around to face the team, and make a suggestion "Anyone's moving right now, it's us!"</p>
<p>Noah lower his head and look to the ground, sorting his mind for a decision. Yet, he was cut short when the ground shook, it's source from his left, where the frontline is. Another Keves' war machine down. Agnus war machines were pushing forward. Realizing that there's no time to lose, he turned to his team and nudged, "Let's go! If the front line breaks, we're all dead!" Never forgetting his explanation, huh...</p>
<p>"But, the position..." Lanz refuted. His speech was cut short with a small shockwave coming from the backup team. An Agnus war machine fell to the ground, bursting in flames. A faceless Keves soldier faced them and affirmed, "We can handle these ourselves. Go on! Move it!"</p>
<p>Noah looked at him for a while, looked down for a second, before returning his glaze and gently nodded. The soldier nodded back in agreement before turning to face the Agnus soldiers. The team then moved their feet, dashing past exchanging beams that whipped down their sides. Red particles continued rising from the ground, floating into the air.</p>
<p>Suddenly, they was a dark shadow grew in front of them, forcing them to an abrupt stop and turned their glaze up. Thud, crank, crank. Something just smashed into the ground before them. They could hear the moving arms of machines. An Agnus war machine just landed before them, opening its arms as if to welcome their death. Lanz gasped, "A <strong>Levnis</strong>!"</p>
<p>"That's what hitting us? Well now we know." Noah replied.</p>
<p>"It's do or die, Noah!" Eunie shouted, perhaps she knew it's not time to let Noah decide if he needs to think. She summoned her blade, Lanz and Noah followed. "Got it!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(Some time later)</p>
<p>Several explosions in the Levnis's chest and joints, sent it toppling down. The group looked from a ledge the situation of the battle. Too many levnises destroyed. Too many corpses laid on the ground, unattended amidst the busyness of massacre. The remains continued to fight till the last. Clearly, the Keves outnumbered the Agnus. The last few were slained without mercy. The Agnus that fell to the ground never had a chance to stand up; a sword already thrusted into his chest while he tried.</p>
<p>With the last soldier down, the Agnus' flame clock levnis lost its electromagnetic beam that hold its joints together. Pieces crashed down the floor, sending shockwaves to its vicinity. The Keves that were still alive were so tired they had to hold onto their blades, using it as a stick to remain standing. Upon seeing their final subject, the flame clock levnis, down; regained their strength, removed their dependency on their blade, and managed to ran forward, throwing both arms into the air and shouted, "Victory!" The announcement reached the rest of the team immediately, and they all danced in joy, some raising their blades above their heads. "Haaaaa!!!!" "Victory is ours!" "We won!"</p>
<p>Lanz and Eunie were no different from the others. They sheathed their blades and joined in the party. Noah, however, wasn't amused. He was bemused, perhaps he questioned the need to take other people's lives, their purpose, its meaning. Meanwhile, with no one noticing his weirdness amongst a crowd, shouts continued, "We won!" "Your lives are ours!"</p>
<p>Perhaps they were too tired. A few moments later, they stopped, and the air silenced. Lanz was sitting on the ground, Eunie and Noah standing, yet they didn't break the silence. Noah was still reflecting, all that we know of.</p>
<!-- ### Footnotes: --><div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="memories-of-the-past-born-for-war"><a class="header" href="#memories-of-the-past-born-for-war">Memories of the Past: Born for War</a></h1>
<p>Somewhere far away from the battlefield, unknown number of years earlier.</p>
<p>A dark, navy blue castle, inverted funnel shaped; it's middle pierced high into the dark cumulonimbus-like sky, clouds arranged themselves in hurricane-like shape with its eye the tallest part of the castle.</p>
<p>Somewhere inside the castle, a winged woman, too dark to see her facial features, was holding a staff, standing before a throne. As if she received some signal, she raised her staff into mid-air, and its tips released a bright green light for a few seconds, after which we could hear machinery cranking coming from the hall. Metal vessels rose from the ground. Each metal vessels are lined with pods filled with orange liquids, like how corn kernel lined themselves on the cob.</p>
<p>Taking a closer look, an embryo was floating inside the orange liquid. As bubbles emerged and washed through the embryo, the embryo transformed into a child around age 10, eyes shut, laying inside the chamber, wearing clothes (???). God knows what fertilizer did the winged woman gave them; not even cancer can grow at this rate! Nor do they need oxygen, as no tubings were attached to their mouth or nose, like baby submerged in amniotic fluid; except a baby can get its oxygen from the umbilical cord, this has nothing.</p>
<p>Probably not long later, at a training ground, daytime. A Kevesi Levnis propelled itself on the air towards the landing point inside the training ground, stretching its arms while lowering itself onto the ground. After it landed, its doors opened, and young Kevesi soldiers marched out from the Levnises. These seems untrained, perhaps they just got "borned" from the castle. In the crowd, we spot Noah, Lanz, Eunie, that fat guy, all as a child, the age we first saw them during the Queen's anniversary. They were lining up in perfect rows and columns.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every one of us, is born looking like this. As soldiers. As weapons for slaying Agnians... Yes. All of us live only to fight.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Moving on, young soldiers were exchanging blows with each other, enhancing their melee weapon wielding skills. They were inside a training chamber, surrounded by fences, without roofs.</p>
<p>On the other side of the fence is another fenced clearings. Instead of empty space, boxes and tall obstacles estimated around 2 meters high, both made of metals, lined around. This is an arena for team battle. Here, Noah was fighting another young Kevesi, winged head, curly hairs, with speckles on his face.</p>
<p>"Tch! Cut that out!" while the Kevesi was dealing blows at Noah, with Noah defending and dodging, "Stupid! Noah!" Noah danced around the blade, yet before he could catch a breath, bullets swirled past him and hit the obstacles behind him. He quickly made a dash towards Lanz, whom was holding a broadsword larger than his shoulder width. The broadsword is capable of generating a frequency shield that could stop bullets on its path.</p>
<p>"Nice one, Lanz!"</p>
<p>"Too early for that! Look, it's you they're after here!" Lanz replied to Noah. Eunie was an obstacle away from them, firing bullets with her blade at the winged boy. Yet, before bullets could kick him out, a girl wielding a broadsword similar to Lanz managed to slide in front of him, generating a frequency shield, and blocked all incoming bullets.</p>
<p>While suppressing fire, Eunie shouted back at the boys, "Just take out their Attackers and we're golden. They're gonna get it handed to 'em." Perhaps her speech diverted her attention; a bullet whoozed past her, after which she hid behind metal barriers taller than her, complaining, "Flickerin' Hoope... You're as slippery as Noah sometimes!" Apparently, Hoope was still firing her way while she speaks. Only after finishing her sentence did Eunie continued firing at the winged boy (with the girl still blocking).</p>
<p>The winged boy wasn't amused with Eunie's speaking: "Eunie... Chick never shuts up." Putting his hand on his bluetooth, he shouted into it, "Kite! Ranged Arts!"</p>
<p>Kite, whom hold a staff taller than him, heard the signal and replied, "Easy!" He stuck his head beside the obstacle where he was hiding and saw Hoope dashing for another obstacle in front of his, firing at Noah as soon as his torso was blocked from their vision.</p>
<p>Kite emerged from his hiding place, raising his staff into midair. Droplets of energy particles whooshed in, and moments later, formed 3 globules of energy ball beside and above the staff. Kite targeted his shots at Eunie. Eunie, whom continued to hide behind obstacles after firing a few shots, heard the drag the energy ball made with air particles, looked up into the sky, and immediately make a run for her life. Yet, the energy ball seems to incorporated with a tracking system, zoomed past the top of the obstacles, took a turn midair, before hitting the ground behind Eunie, exploded and sent her hurling into the air for a moment, as she slammed and slid herself on the ground. "Ahhhhh!"</p>
<p>Lanz heard her shouts, turned to look at her. "Eunie!" He pulled his broadsword with him, running towards Eunie's direction. Hoope, seeing that Eunie was in his shooting range, clear of obstacles, fired a shot at her before she could get up. Lanz managed to pull in front of Eunie on time, intercepting the bullet, shielding her while she struggled to get up.</p>
<p>"Didn't account for Kite... Ugh... I snuffed this up." She was heavily injured, coughing while both of her hands supported her torso. As if about to faint, she saw the fat boy, holding a really short staff, running towards her. Upon arrival, he hold his staff over her, which drew the energy particles from the air and created a green ring centered around Eunie. Green energy particles entering Eunie's body made her glow. A few moments later, her wounds, internal and external, were gone. She was healed.</p>
<p>With a concerned facial expression, the fat boy looked at Eunie and asked, "You OK, Eunie?" Eunie summoned enough strength to stand up, replied while summoning her blade, "Cheers for that. You're a lifesaver, <strong>Joran</strong>!"</p>
<p>The winged boy saw the drama and was pissed off, "Sparkin' deadweight...!" He moved towards Hoope, whom now stands beside Kite, the girl shielding behind. Together, they hid themselves behind obstacles. It's time for a meeting.</p>
<p>"Hey! Change of plan! Kite, you keep firing, and don't stop."</p>
<p>Kite questioned, "At what?"</p>
<p>"Whatever you want."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Kite was clearly confused.</p>
<p>The winged boy looked at him, hands crossed, and said: "Go ballistic. Just draw their attention," then turned and face Hoope, "'Cause what we're after here, is that lame duck." He was referring to Joran.</p>
<p>Hoope wasn't convinced, "Joran?! But he's bottom of the class. Why bother?"</p>
<p>The winged boy explained: "Thing is, the brat's still a decent Healer. Get it?"</p>
<p>The girl seems to got it: "Ahh, right. So we're playing by the book here." (In game, you want to kill the healer first, or whatever damage you dealt would be reduced or even cancelled out)</p>
<p>The winged guy agreed, "Pisses me off, but the fight'll be good as won!" He was determined.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" All replied in unison, as they dashed out to their positions. Kite ignored precision, blasting the floor with his ranged arts.</p>
<p>Lanz make a run for the boxes, sitting down while signaling in his bluetooth: "Eunie! Take out Kite!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Eunie was trying to intercept Hoope, when one of Kite's ranged arts blasted in front of her. "Can't! They've got the advantage, AND they're behind cover!"</p>
<p>"Noah! Can we flank 'em?" Noah was running with Joran behind, jumping to and fro dodging Kite's ranged arts. Joran was slower and less adept to speed. A blast landed in front of him while he gripped strongly onto his staff, lifting it in front of his face to cover from the dust. "Noah!" Lanz was shouting without hearing a reply.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the winged boy signaled to the broadsword girl their direction, and they ran towards Joran's position. Noah saw them moved, but wasn't yet sure of their intention. "They're not in their usual formation..."</p>
<p>Hoope did not give him time to think it through. A bullet was shot where Noah pop his head out. Eunie joined Noah a moment later, aiming her cannon to return fire. Noah was attuned to an energy ball on Eunie's current position. He took for a run, jumped and hugged Eunie; together, they slid out of their way before the energy ball blasted by their side. That's enough time for him to think, "We're snuffed! Kite's just a decoy! So they're really after..." There's only one guy left.</p>
<p>"Urg.." Lanz took his broadsword and get running towards Joran. He hadn't got much time, as the winged boy and the broadsword girl was already near. Joran raised his staff to his face in a defensive stance. The winged boy sliced towards him. Just as we thought he's out, Lanz managed to intercept on time, the remaining shockwave sent Joran falling on his back, "err huh."</p>
<p>"Quick thinking, Lanz!" the winged boy exclaimed. Yet, with 2 against 1, the situation don't change, even if Lanz's specialized in defense. Upon sticking his sword into the ground, a frequency shield capped him and Joran. Both swings their weapon at the shield, "Tough guy! But ya can't hold out forever."</p>
<p>"Spark" Noah, realizing their situation, make a run to help out Lanz; yet Hoope's bullet wasn't ignorable.</p>
<p>"Noah!" Eunie tried to catch up with Noah, but she was held back by Kite's ranged arts.</p>
<p>"Lanz...!" Joran exclaimed in a long tone, eyes wide open as if he was about to cry.</p>
<p>"Rrgh...! You stay put... They wanna take you outta the running!" Lanz gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>"Yaaaaa!" A final blow from the winged boy, and the frequency shield was zeroed. Joran shielded his face, "Yeah, but...!"</p>
<p>Lanz cut him short, wasn't giving up, "Don't you leave that snuffing spot!" He had to deal with 2 positions at the same time, sliding his broadsword left and right in the least possible movement. A strong hit came his way, and his broadsword went out of hand. He caught it a moment later with his left hand before another blow was delivered.</p>
<p>Joran was desperate, perhaps desolate, both hands on the floor, "Why would you..." He gritted his teeth, and suddenly make for a run. Lanz couldn't believed his eyes, as if Joran had not followed his instructions.</p>
<p>Noah and Eunie was still trapped. After another hit, the winged boy handed Lanz over to the broadsword girl, himself running towards their ultimate target. While Joran was running, a ball of energy emerged from his staff. As the energy accumulated to its threshold, he turned and pointed his staff towards Lanz, "All that I am, is yours..."</p>
<p>A green beam of energy zoomed past the winged boy, whom temporarily stopped in his past, perhaps realizing that's the end of Joran. He didn't try to intercept the beam either. He just looked at Lanz and saw the beam entered him, healing him. Joran ran out of breadth and collapsed on the floor, face down. "Now... you can carry on..."</p>
<p>The winged boy wasn't amused, slowly walking over in front of him, sword over his shoulder, "You shoulda done that much SOONER!" With the last word, he sliced down at Joran.</p>
<hr />
<p>Badges, with its upper side broader than its lower, shaped like a wing, with two swords crossed as its symbol, was awarded to all members of the winged boy's team. Only the best team, theirs, were rewarded. The winged boy grinned, looking at the various recruits standing below while they were "on stage." He felt superior to the those standing below.</p>
<p>Even with Joran's final help, Lanz, Eunie, and Noah didn't make it. Noah wasn't disappointed, but he was the exception, not the rule.</p>
<p>Afterwards, in another scene, just Noah's team. Joran was shuddering in a corner. Lanz, with gritted teeth, went up to him, snatched him by his right shoulder with his left hand, pulled him up and towards him, clenched his right palm into a fist, holding it up aiming at Joran. Noah went up and hold the wrist of his fist. "Get off me!"</p>
<p>Releasing and pushed back Joran with Noah's still holding his wrist, he exclaimed, "Had to go and play the hero, didn't he?"</p>
<p>Noah lowered his fist down, questioned, "You really think you could've taken 'em?"</p>
<p>"Urggg" Lanz turned around, pulling off his hands.{{footnote: Eunie was standing near them, arms crossed.}}</p>
<p>Eunie, whom was laying her back to a nearby tall obstacle, took step and walked towards them, looking first at Noah, then focusing on Lanz: "I think Joran did the right thing. If he hadn't used his powers back there, you'd have been first out of the running!"</p>
<p>Lanz turned to face Eunie, walking closer and closer towards her as words flow: "Yeah, but still... Didn't have to go get himself killed for it!"</p>
<p>Eunie, her head only reached Lanz's shoulder, had to bend her back to look at his face. Noah interrupted, "Come on. He was trying to protect you! He lured in <strong>Garvel</strong>'s gang. Gave us a chance to turn it around."</p>
<p>"Urg..." Lanz faced the other side again. Joran didn't speak a word, his eyes on the floor. Noah and Eunie was looking at Lanz, continued: "You know who wasn't up to it? We weren't."</p>
<p>Lanz have trouble acknowledging his weakness, turned to him and exclaimed, "Yeah, BUT!"</p>
<p>"Just stop it!" Joran had enough, shouted. "No. More. Arguing... It's my fault. I should've... just done a better job. (breathe) Then we'd have won." He was on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>Noah tried to soothed him, "Hey!"</p>
<p>Joran continued, "So much for getting to the final, huh... Sorry... I let us down on your big day... I'm so... sorry!" He ran off, wiping his tears on the way. Lanz couldn't stand the crying, faced away.</p>
<p>Noah was confused, "What big day...?"</p>
<p>Eunie snapped, "The birth-day."</p>
<p>Noah looked at her, even more confused... "What- Whose?"</p>
<p>"Yours dummy! It's your second term, right? Remember?"</p>
<p>Noah's eyes was wide opened. "Ah..." He just realized.</p>
<p>Gingerly treaded in small step towards Lanz, like a fairy dancing, hands crossed, "A win would've been a nice surprise. Lanz was pretty fired up too, weren't ya?" Perhaps she was trying to lighten up the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Lanz shooked his head a bit, turned to Eunie, "Cut it out!" Then walked off.</p>
<p>"Hey!" Noah called out to him.</p>
<p>Lanz, looking back from the tip of his glimpse, "What?"</p>
<p>"You'll apologize, right?" said Noah.</p>
<p>"... Might do, might not." Lanz spoke while he walked off. Eunie put her arms on her waist, walked up to line up with Noah, watching off Lanz.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>We each have a lifespan of 10 years. We call them terms. Life begins with our first term, and ends at the close of our tenth. And over the course of those 10 years, we fight, continually. Though in reality, there aren't that many who can hold their flame for the whole 10 years. Most lose their lives on the battlefield, before they reach year 10. But those who do survive to the end... are honored in a special service.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The next day, at the training grounds. Noah, Lanz, and Eunie were standing in a circle. Soldiers were seen walking, some gathered together, speaking to each other. A group of younger term soldiers dashed out a door near them, past them, and went out of view. The green Nopon joined Noah's and the others.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We call it... the Homecoming.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As if he sensed something, Noah turned his head and looked twoards his right, as Joran was stampeding towards them. He shouted, "Morning, Joran!"</p>
<p>As Joran approached, he replied with an upbeat tone, "Hey Noah, morning." Awkwardly, "Morning, uh... Lanz..."</p>
<p>"Hmph." Lanz snorted, turned his head away, and ran off. Joran might had thought he hadn't forgave him; translator thought he probably wasn't satisfied with himself, or he couldn't lower his head. "Get a move on! Quick, we're gonna miss the Homecoming!" Lanz was shouting at them from a distance, hands on his waist. Soldiers were dashing past them while he stopped and waited.</p>
<p>That changed the subject and the atmosphere. "First one they've ever had here, right?" Eunie exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Yeah, isn't it awesome!" Lanz replied. Together, they ran off. Noah looked at Joran and nodded to him, which he nodded back, and they  ran after them. Reminds of similar situation in another hyperspace? Except now with an extra green Nopon following.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="homecoming-off-seers-shower"><a class="header" href="#homecoming-off-seers-shower">Homecoming, Off Seers, Shower</a></h1>
<p>A winged man knelt before a humanoid wearing a red suit, with a purple glowing core attached to his/her chest (like Iron Man's core), similar to the one we seen from afar standing on the shoulder of the flame clock levnis during the battle. The suit covered all his/her features, including his/her face, and the only exposed features is the yellow-orange sharp eyes, as if (s)he had the eyes of a jaguar, locking on to a prey. The winged man raised his head to look at him.</p>
<p>Behind the winged man, we saw soldiers lined up, including Noah and his team.</p>
<p>The red-suit humanoid turned from looking at the winged man, to the other direction. There were also soldiers lined facing him, the winged man, and Noah and the other soldiers. They stand on both sides, with a middle alleyway, which he walked till near its end, then turn left and give way to a winged woman. It's the woman we saw inside the castle whom gave embryo fertilizers! She wore a silver-white mask, silver hair spreaded around, with the hair in front of her chest curled forward.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Whoa! Even the <strong>Queen</strong>'s come out!"</p>
<p>"So that's Her Majesty, huh?" Eunie was awestruck.</p>
<p>"Wow... I've never seen her before..." Behind them stood Joran and Noah, where Joran expressed his excitement.</p>
<p>Noah was thinking of something else, he just agreed like an automatic responder: "Hmm..."</p>
<p>The Queen step forward and walk the central alleyway, and stop before the winged man. The winged man was still knelt, one leg on the floor, another bent; one hand on his bent leg, another fist on the floor. The soldiers beside the alleyway hold up their flutes, bring it to their lips, and the homecoming melody filled the air in unison.</p>
<p>Noah had lots of questions. We can't know what he thought, but he was focusing on a guy in particular. The guys had yellow long hair, tied to a loose ponytail behind. He is one of the choir team, currently holding his black flute and playing it. We saw logo that represent how much terms they had back of his palm. The logo composed of 5 diamonds, each diamond had a smaller diamond within; so a double-decked diamond. One of the diamond lay in the central, while the other four lay north, east, south, and west of the central. The diamond on the east and west had an extra line cutting through the diamonds, parallel to the north-south diamonds. The western diamond and line, plus the central diamond, was still red; while the other 3 diamonds and lines already greyed out. He hadn't got much time left. We haven't saw Eunie's or Noah's, but on young Lanz, it's located on his chin, which is mostly red, signifying he was still young then.</p>
<p>While Noah was thinking, the Queen held both her hands up into the air, as if to embrace the winged guy. Yellow specks of particles suddenly appeared from his body, to which he looked at them; perhaps realizing it's time, held his hands up into the sky and looked up, to see the last of the world before his time. As we focused our attention on the red-suit humanoid, (s)he probably is thinking something else, though behind the mask, we can't know for sure.</p>
<p>"So cool!" gasped Joran.</p>
<p>Lanz held both of his palms into fists, "I heard the stories, but this is just wild!" Then, in a lighter tone, "That's gonna be me someday! Just you try and stop me! You guys, too. You're totally making it with me!" Pointing towards Joran and the others.</p>
<p>"Of course!" Eunie replied.</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Joran was hesitating.</p>
<p>"And you, Noah! Right?!" Lanz looked towards Noah. Noah was still in his world, responded without acknowledging, "Huh? Sure..." Perhaps coming back from his world, he realized his tone wasn't firm enough: "Yeah, you bet." One could see some seeds planted in him, waiting to germinate.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Our lives came from the Queen, and we all lived for a chance to take part in the Homecoming. The chance... to return to the Queen's embrace. Carrying out 10 years of service, fighting. That was our whole world. Nobody ever thought to question it. Until that day...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Probably referring the guy whom Noah looked up to.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in the battlefield. Noah was playing the flute, similar melody to those of homecoming. Previously red particles floating in the sky turned blue. Husks, Agnes or Keves, glowed blue, emanating more blue particles as the melody hummed. Kevesi levnises drove over Agnus' soldiers husks. Kevesi soldiers stepped on their torso, careful not on step on their hands and legs or they would lose balance easily. Most were yawning, looking down, exhausted. Flying levnises, after loaded the soldiers, changed to flying form, retracted their ground support, and blasted off into the air. The flame clock levnises had already gone, not seen anywhere. All except Noah's team, whom waited for Noah as he played the melody.</p>
<p>Lanz sat where he was, Eunie, the other guy, and the green nopon stood. As he completed and stuffed his flute into his back pocket, he looked down from his vantage point, reminisced for all soldiers. Some Kevesi were so badly injured their colleagues had their arms over their shoulder, helping them walk.</p>
<p>"Do you have to?" Lanz sounded, <em>not</em> looking at Noah.</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh?"</p>
<p>"You shouldn't be sending those guys off like that."</p>
<p>"What? Why not?"</p>
<p>"Why are you like this, Noah? It's Agnus! Our enemy?"</p>
<p>"Well, yeah... They don't have an off-seer, though. To send them."</p>
<p>Eunie sniped back, "Yep. They all bit the dust, thanks to us."</p>
<p>"So what?" Lanz shrugged.</p>
<p>"Look, there's no rule not to." Noah tried to explain. Lanz wasn't about to hear his explanation anyways.</p>
<p>"Then, what, you're just gonna... keep going? I don't get you, Noah."</p>
<p>"I know we're putting our lives on the line. But still..."</p>
<p>Eunie had enough of his explanation, "Yeah, yeah, we get it already.<em>'Friend or foe, someone has to lay them to rest.'</em>" She speak words Noah had spoken before, in a deeper voice to imitate, while trod-ing up towards him, stopping to stand by his side. "<em>'For that is my role as an off-seer.'</em> Right?!" With the last word, she knocked his chest with her elbow.</p>
<p>Noah turned and looked at her: "Uh... Is my voice that deep?" More concerned about the imitation than the content, huh?</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't impressed, hands on her waist, looking up at him. "Shut it, you. I wasn't trying to be anyone specific." Then, changed the topic, "Right, I've had about enough of all this depressing crap. Let's head back and hit the showers. I'm all gunked up with blood and sweat."</p>
<p>She walked off, eyeing her elbows where blood and sweat stained. Lanz stood up. The last of the levnises had already roll off or flew off. Lanz, looking them off, complained, "Uhh... Bye, transport. Guess we'd missed it again..."</p>
<p>Eunie eyes wide opened as she took two steps forward, as if trying to retain the levnises, complaining, "Oh... bollocks! Ugh, Noah always does this! How many times is it we've had to walk home now?!" Then, they walked off.</p>
<p>Noah took a final look at the battlefield by himself, still had many questions in his head, before turning and joined the team.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on the environment:</strong> Between this battlefield region and where their colony was, was called Everblight Plain. It was located in the Aetia Region. The roads between the two locations was filled with relatively weak monsters, like "bunnits," rabbits white, brown, or black, with a mace attached to the tip of their tails; or "wisp," which are wasp-like creatures, where the "night wisp" glow in the dark while the morning ones don't, and other insectoids and animals.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>(Upon arrival at the colony)</p>
<p>The flame clock levnis parked in the middle of the colony. Around it, rectangular bunker camps made of metal roofs were set up; they are the barracks. Below it from a distance, we saw a cloth tent covering many tables, probably the canteen. There were also some barrels of unknown use, to the right of the canteen. To its right, another metal bunker structure, the shower. It was evening, street-lights holding with very long fluorescent filament stood, itself emanating yellow-orange hue against the yellow-orange light from the setting sun.</p>
<p>"Ah, made it back at last. What a hike!" Good old Lanz.</p>
<p>The green nopon speak, and we finally know his name: "Such long walkings tough on legs of <strong>Riku</strong>... Riku totally popped."</p>
<p>Noah turned to look at the flame clock levnis: "It was a massive battle, but we don't seem to have taken too many injuries, fortunately."</p>
<p>To which Lanz replied, "Yeah, well, I guess that's the upside of going against a low-rank, no-mark colony like that."</p>
<p>Eunie: "On the flipside, we didn't manage to fill up the Flame Clock all that much..."</p>
<p>The last guy whom shot when Noah first blocked and signaled to Lanz, slightly dark skin, with his hair stripped with rolls, named <strong>Mwamba.</strong> "Ah, it's all for the best. At least we've all come back in one piece."</p>
<p>Noah: "I agree. And anyway, we should be all right on that front, for the time being."</p>
<p>Riku: "Noah, talking out here just waste time. How about friends move chatter into bath."</p>
<p>"Good thinking! Let's do that." Slow response, Eunie...</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Each colony had their names. Kevesi colonies used the numbering system, so Noah's colony is <strong>Colony 9</strong> (which they're currently at). On the other hand, Agnian colonies used the alphabetical system, e.g. Colony Alpha (A).</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Inside the shower.</p>
<p>Men and women shared the same shower room, without cover. Nopon too! All stripped themselves naked, of course. Mist from hot water greatly reduced the proximity of our vision, reaching Noah's chest. Noah turned off the knob to the shower, water stopped splashing out the shower head.</p>
<p>Noah turned and walked towards a shared spa, putting one feet before the other. To his front left, Eunie was already in the spa, leaning her back onto the walls, her hands on the wall{{footnote: or floor}}. "Ahhh" Noah sighed. Feels refreshing. We could also see nopons in the pool; floating and swimming around.</p>
<p>"Say... You know how you became an <strong>off-seer</strong>... after what happened...?" Eunie began the conversation, slightly bending forward towards Noah, concentrating her attention.</p>
<p>"Hm?" Noah took a more relaxing stance, curved his back more until his shoulders were immersed in the waters. "Uh... I guess, yeah..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memories:</strong> Flames rolled all around, Joran standing in the middle. Rocks came tumbling down around him. One can't read his facial emotions, which they seem neutral; no desperation, no smiles either. As more boulders came smashing down, he was buried alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Does it... still hurt?" Eunie prompt.</p>
<p>Noah turned his head and looked at her, then looked up, changing his posture while he speak: "No... I can't say I'm totally over it... but I'm getting there. I've sent... so many of our comrades. A lot's happened." {{footnote: Riku was swimming in the distance on the spa. (Didn't want to put this in as it disturbs the flow)}}</p>
<p>"Both for me... and those sent on." He recalled the first homecoming they've seen, the focus was the yellow-haired guy.</p>
<p>"Mmm." Eunie dipped her body lower, her chin touching the water surface. Noah turned to face another direction, changing the subject, "Anyway, worry about him."</p>
<p>Lanz was showering next to Mwamba. Something on his right shoulder seemed to pissed him off, while Mwamba was offering his help. He smiled back and rejected as if nothing happened, and they chatted a bit.</p>
<p>Noah: "Poor guy. Pushes himself too hard."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What can we do. He's been like this for ages."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Memories:</strong> Flames surrounded, young Lanz running towards Joran, Noah held his left arms with both hands, tugged him out of the flames. Lanz stretches his right arm, eyes wide opened, trying to reach Joran, mumbling "No! No!" all the time. Pebbles fell in front of him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eunie, putting her arms behind her head, shut her eyes: "He never got to apologize. So... You know..."</p>
<p>Lanz seemed to be done with showering, showing up behind Noah: "Hm? You guys talking about the battle?" Then, putting his feet and lower himself into the water beside Noah, "Don't worry about the bonus points... 'cause I'll have nabbed 'em all!"</p>
<p>That rigid change of subject must've interruped Eunie's reminiscing moments. She stood up and look, her body slightly leaned forward, at Lanz, "Er... the snuff you on about? I'll have you know I clocked up a fair bit more!"</p>
<p>Lanz didn't agree, and was probably emotionally hijacked, also stood up and face Eunie, her hands waving and pointing at himself, "Oh, yeah, sure. I'm the one who took the heavy off its hinges. They give you loads of points."</p>
<p>"Ooh, big deal!" Eunie walked up to him slowly, cutting him. "If that heal had come a few seconds later, you'd be sleeping in the dirt!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Uh, yeah, no, uh-uh... That was part of the plan. You couldn't tell? I just felt like giving you the credit. But don't worry, you can thank me later."</p>
<p>Noah watched the drama for a while and wasn't interested in getting involved, sliding slightly away from the center point of conflict, and look up through the small window at the top of the shower bunker. Through it, stars of varying brightness paste themselves against the dark sky, illuminated dimly by the remaining sunlight. Seen from outside, two waterfalls fall from a ledge to the right of the colony, the ledge protruding, making a horn shape, while other protrudes irregularly. Few clouds covered a small portion of the stars.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Huh? You're a right muppet, Lanz..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Finishing their shower (and quarrel), Noah walked up to the team, the last to finish dressing up. Lanz, with his hands behind his heads, yawned. "All right then! Off to bed with me."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed, turning to face Noah, "Yeah... All that walking's really done a number on me!"</p>
<p>Noah felt awkward, scratching the back of his neck, "I'm sorry..."</p>
<p>Eunie already forgave him, knowing he wouldn't have changed his mind anyways, "Hehe! Come on, let's go!"</p>
<p>"Yeah!"</p>
<p>"Meh meh!" And they walked off to bed.</p>

<p>At the break of dawn. The early sunlight reflected on nature's surface, presenting a relaxing, darker hue to the eyes. Street lamps were still illuminating. Except those watching the night, soldiers were still sleeping in their barracks. A high-pitch siren disturbed the serenity. Noah, upon hearing the siren, jumped and sit up on his bed for a moment, before realizing what was happening. He ran outside to see soldiers already dressed, running towards the assembly point.</p>
<p>"An emergency assembly?"</p>
<p>The rest of the team got up slower, came out of the barrack. Eunie was stretching her arms and yawning, "It's the crack of dawn, guys..."</p>
<p>"Ugh, why...?" complained Lanz.</p>
<p>Noah: "No idea. We'd better take a look." Together, Noah, Eunie, Lanz, Mwamba, and Riku joined in the running.</p>
<hr />
<p>Soldiers were already lined up in the assembly square. About the last to arrive, Eunie and the rest stood at the final row, herself still yawning, "Remind me, what're we lining up for here?"</p>
<p>Mwamba probably had got the news somewhere: "Royal decree from the Castle. They say an enemy armored unit's approaching this area."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Come on, man... I just got to sleep and everything..."</p>
<p>Riku: "Friend's fault for staying up late!"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Lanz was getting angry, "And whose fault was it I couldn't sleep? I asked you to do the maintenance on my <strong>power frame</strong>, but you totally messed up my settings!"</p>
<p>"Oho? Ahh. That probably different frame." Riku wouldn't accept the blame, explaining in his favor: "Riku is popular guypon, crushed by weight of fans asking to do favors. Sometimes mix up orders. Meh. If configs bamboozle, why not fix by self?"</p>
<p>Lanz was closing his eyes, "patiently" suppressing his anger trying to calm down. Yet, that's too much for his patience. He get into an angry stance, shadowing Riku: "That's why I didn't get any sleep, furball!"</p>
<p>He hadn't managed to get into action when the commander's voice attracted their attention. "I'm here to announce today's mission." Probably it's more important to listen to the commander than beating up Riku, he stood back in line, while the commander continued, ignoring him:{{footnote: Since he's not disturbing the others nor interrupting him, except Riku, anyways.}} "You have one target. It's currently on course for the suppresion area, here."</p>
<p>The commander tappd twice on his temple, his right iris glowed yellow as information of a map was broadcasted to everyone's irises. To receive the broadcast, the soldiers all tapped twice on their temple to activate their iris. On the center, we see a 3D map with mountains and valleys, and a blue dot appearing, their target.</p>
<p>"Judging from the mass, it's expected to be large in size." As he spoke, the blue dot plotted an expected route, ending at another blue dot. The mapped zoomed out in the process.{{footnote: Translator can't make much out of the map when the contours were all in yellow, and the valley wasn't very clear, sorry... }} The ending blue dot is probably the intercepting location. "And based on its speed, we estimate it will reach the Alfeto Valley at 0100 hours."</p>
<p>As the commander release his hand from his temple and stop broadcasting, he continued: "Notably, the target's emitting a considerable amount of ether energy. As for your mission, deploy at the canyon by the designated time. Investigate and destroy the source of ether." As he finished his sentence, the others release their hands from their temples, stopped receiving visuals.</p>
<p>"Commander, one question." a faceless soldier asked.</p>
<p>"Go."</p>
<p>"About this target... Can we assume it's from Agnus?"</p>
<p>"We don't know. We haven't been able to confirm, but it seems that they're also gunning for it. This would suggest it should be seen as part of... a different enemy force."</p>
<p>He turned to the others, "Combat with Agnian troops in the area is also expected. Details will be sent to your <strong>Iris</strong> after deployment. Clear? You are to remain vigilant throughout the operation. Dismissed!"</p>
<p>The soldiers put their feet together, raised their right arm and hold it into a fist, palm facing their shoulder, a sign similar to "aye, aye, captain!"</p>
<hr />
<p>They gathered at the back entrance of the colony.{{footnote: When they returned from Everblight plain earlier, they entered the colony from its front entrance.}} Soldiers and levnises lined up, preparing for departure. Two main types of levnises we can see here, excluding the transporter which carry soldiers that can fly in the air. One already appeared in the battle against Agnus earlier, does not have legs but two wheels installed at an angle at the bottom tip of their torso. Two larger wheels that were used as both a moving mechanism and a rotating saw were equipped to its arms.{{footnote: Imagined it as the extinct bird that have claws on their wings, which they used to fight, but have short legs.}} It's head bent forward, aiming at the floor.</p>
<p>Another levnis stand straight up, with 4 legs, each tip of the legs were like that of a compass you used in primary school to draw circles. It's left hand was equipped with a blade, it's right an oval shield.{{footnote: It looks like the spider woman whom had their lower torso that of a spider and spider legs, but upper torso of a human.}}</p>
<p>Lanz was impressed: "Yeaeeah... Now we're bringing out the big guns!"</p>
<p>Noah was concerned. He feel that something wasn't right, and it had been ages since the whole colony went all out. He went into deep thought "Hm..."</p>
<p>Lanz would like to know what he's thinking, "What's up?"</p>
<p>"Our rank... it <em>is</em> Copper, right?" Noah wanted to confirm.</p>
<p>Eunie took a step forward from their back to line up with them, replying in a giggle tone: "Talking about <strong>colony ranks</strong>? I mean, we did win big yesterday. It'll only be a matter of time before we make Iron. That'll be it."</p>
<p>"Uh... Yeah, I dunno... about that." Perhaps advancing from Copper to Iron wasn't as easy as it sounds.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Riku had been mysterious, far more knowledgable than the rest of the team, "Oho? Looks like they rolling out Silver rank for this operation."</p>
<p>"Silver rank! What would they be doing here...?" Noah and Lanz, shocked, turned and faced Riku, before turning to face each other.</p>
<p>Lanz shrugged: "Orders are orders. Can't complain about the help, though."</p>
<p>A soldier came to the front, interrupting their conversation, "We're moving out. Wedge formation until Point D! Don't fall behind!" As he finished, levnises lead the ways while soldiers followed.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Yellow grass grows all over the place, clearly lacking chlorophyll. Lots of plateau and rocks sticking out from the earth. A river cuts through the land. Red flamingos with white belly were seen gathering by the river bank. Waterfall from a distance falling off unclimbable cliffs, refilling the river. Eagles circling the air, looking for its prey. Deers munched on grass, gathered in groups. Very few trees stood on the <strong>Yzana Plains</strong>, Aetia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As they traversed, they saw a squad of soldiers being stopped by wolf with silver-gray skin, red manes.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Hey, check it out!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "The spearhead squad."</p>
<p>Mwamba: "Huh, Volffs? They're not much of an emeny if you take 'em on one at a time. Still..." Apparently, the wolf belonged to the "volff" family.</p>
<p>Noah: "The main objective of the op is still ahead. If these guys've hit an impasse, we ought to help them."</p>
<p>Eunie: "I thought you'd say something like that."</p>
<p>They ran in and joined the squad, drawing their weapons and helped the soldiers.</p>
<p>(Some moments later)</p>
<p>As the volffs die, "lives" emanate from their glowing-red corpses, rose into the air, and entered their flame clock. From their irises, pixels representing "lives" were seen entering the flame clock on the left, though it replenishes nil amount. A faceless soldier complained about it: "This all we've getting? Gonna need something a bit more meaty about now."</p>
<p>Another faceless soldier: "Tell me about it. Colony we fought the other day? <strong>Dirt rank</strong>. Hardly filled up the Flame Clock at all."  Eunie and his team watched them leave as they talked.</p>
<p>Noah turned to look at the team: "Lanz, Eunie."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah?"</p>
<p>"No heroics this time. Keep your heads screwed on."</p>
<p>Lanz always wanted to be the hero, rebutted: "Pfft, come on man. No one ever tell you? I'm a hero in the making, I am! Without my heroics, our combat unit would be right up the..."</p>
<p>"Lanz!" Noah glared at him, cut him short, with a serious look on his face.</p>
<p>A second later, Lanz: "...creek!"</p>
<p>Noah walked up to him, nudged to him: "Come on. Stop being so cocky."</p>
<p>"I-it was just a joke, mate... No need to glare..." Lanz body was bending backwards, seldom seeing Noah being so serious, but he agreed to compromise.</p>
<p>Eunie came by his side, concerned, "Is it that bad?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... Something's... not right here. Somethings just feels... off." He can't be sure, but his unconscious gathered information he's not aware from the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Mwamba joined in, "Noah's intuition's never wrong."</p>
<p>Riku agreed: "Friends better listen to Noah."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Got it." They continued on the rocky trail. Down and up, we could see a cloud so near to the ground as if it could be touched. Plateau stretched the side of the trail, like a broken bridge, shadowing it. Somewhere in between to the right, we could see it's a ridge which they could fall off if they weren't careful. Mountains of unmeasurable height stretch far into the clouds in the far background. The walls of the cliffs were rocky.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> In the distant, vines curled along tall pillars of rocks that supported a plateau, like a mushroom. A spring with "krabble" {{footnote: In real life, they were animals that steal other animal's shell to use as their shelter, usually living on seabed.}} gathered around it. Below a tree, apparently dead, laid some patches of red, too far to ascertain what it was. To both sides, cliffs sandwiched the path.  <strong>Alfeto Valey</strong>, in the Aetia Region. As usual, the animals roamed the region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Stopping before a large rock, Riku pulled out a ball from his pocket. On the top of the ball is a blue core, which projected a screen like a hologram, displaying the map. He confirmed their location, turned to the team and said, "Rendezvous point up ahead!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Since Nopon can't use Irises, isn't it a pain to have to keep fiddling with a <strong>terminal</strong>?"</p>
<p>"No fear. Riku take it in stride. Also, if pretend to not look at terminal, can ignore all sort of troublesome and tiresome communications." {{footnote: Unsure whether by "troublesome and tiresome" he meant by "as if one was handling an iris," or hearing complain from others.}}</p>
<p>"Whoa, that's kinda smart."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a monster jumped out of the ground where the rock was before. Apparently, it was buried underground, with its back the shape of a rock, slightly more shiny and reflective than the coarse rocks we see around the valley, but nevertheless of the same color. The protrudes look like stegosaures. As it shook dirt off his head, he turned and face the team.</p>
<p>"Riku! Watch out!" Noah shouted.</p>
<p>Riku took cover behind Noah, while Mwamba exclaimed, "It was camouflaged as a rock...?" {{footnote: Translator's note: One assumed you lived in this region for so long, yet you never met this monster? Oh dear...}}</p>
<p>Eunie: "We're gonna have to face it!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Here it comes!"</p>
<p>(After the battle) {{footnote: Lives emanate from its corpse.}}</p>
<p>Mwamba was looking at the term symbol on the back of his left hand. The only red being the inner central diamond. He hadn't got much time left. He looked like he was looking forward to Homecoming.</p>
<p>The team saw his action, and Eunie questioned: "So... It's gonna be next month?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... Just a little longer." Mwamba replied.</p>
<p>Lanz: "You're something else, Mwamba. The pride of Colony 9." Lanz's term symbol also had red on the central diamond left, except it also filled the outer diamond, not just the inner.</p>
<p>"Aww, you guys. I've finally made it this far."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What's up?"</p>
<p>Mwamba, covering the symbol with his right palm, "Well... Thing is... I was thinking, after this op, I think I'm gonna go and put in a transfer to the salvage corps. You never know what'll happen on the battlefield, right?"</p>
<p>As he looked up and put his hands down, "You can laugh at me, if you want."</p>
<p>"I ain't laughing, man." Lanz looked seriously at Mwamba, whom raised his eyebrow hearing the comment. "We've only been alive this long because you've always had our backs."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed: "Yep. We owe you a ton. Just make sure you get to your Homecoming, OK?"</p>
<p>Mwamba was grateful, his tone was about to burst into tears: "Lanz, Eunie... You guys..."</p>
<p>"Mwamba," Riku interrupted, "Now not time to relax tear ducts. Let down guard, and you fill Flame Clock of someone else."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Riku, come on!"</p>
<p>Mwamba: "Ha ha! Well, you don't mince words! You <em>are</em> right though."</p>
<p>Noah was lost in his thoughts, when Mwamba interrupted him, "Sorry, Noah."</p>
<p>Noah looked up, confused, "Huh? Oh, no, it's not that. I guess I was just thinking about your Homecoming. It made me feel a little sad..."</p>
<p>In a deeper, teary tone, Mwamba: "Noah..."</p>
<p>Noah encouraged him: "Mwamba, salvage is an important service. Don't feel like you owe us anything."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, Noah." Changing to a higher tone, like when you're shouting instructions: "Right then! Let's get this operation done! Next month's a-Homecomin'!"</p>
<p>As the group speak, Noah recalled his memories.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="memories"><a class="header" href="#memories">Memories</a></h4>
<p>An evening long ago, at the training ground, Noah and Joran sitting side by side. Perhaps it was after the Homecoming.</p>
<p>"I'd love to make it to my Homecoming - maybe if I'm lucky..." said Joran. As he spoke, some bruises on his cheek hurts. He groaned in pain while gently put his fingers on the bruised area.</p>
<p>Noah turned to him and encouraged: "Of course you'll make it, we all will."</p>
<p>"I wonder... I mean, I'm not like you guys... I'm so clumsy."{{footnote: He massaged the bruised spot as he speak.}}</p>
<p>"Come on, you're not! What about the last match? You did way better than everyone else!"</p>
<p>"We still lost though, right? It's OK. I've sort of half given up already." He lowered his head in desolation.</p>
<p>"Joran..."</p>
<p>He raised his head, the light in his eyes, we saw something affirmative inside, "Well, at least...{{footnote: Noah: "Hmm..."}} When I do die, I want to at least be of some use."</p>
<p>Noah can't stand it, stood up and walk in front of him: "Enough of that!"</p>
<p>Joran raised his head to look at him: "Whuh?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk like that! {{footnote: Putting his arms on his waist.}} I've always told you we're a team, haven't I? That means now... and always."</p>
<p>"Aww..." Joran was grateful, lowering his eyelids in a more relaxed position.</p>
<hr />
<p>(another scene)</p>
<p>Flames raged. Lanz ran towards Joran, trying to pull him out of the location. Joran resisted, bent with his shoulders forward, put both his palms on Lanz's chest, and shoved him away. As Lanz flew backwards, his right arm stretched out in his direction reaching out to Joran, eyes wide opened, stones came tumbling down. Joran looked at the live he saved, satisfied. A moment later, he was buried alive before Lanz's eyes.</p>
<hr />
<p>(End of memory)</p>
<p>"Noah... Noah!" Mwamba brought Noah back to the present, and told the team. "I'm gotta go on ahead. We got a call -- Martha's team has a spot free, apparently."</p>
<p>"Ahh, right." Noah affirmed.</p>
<p>"Do me a favor?" Mwamba requested, "Come along with me, to the office."</p>
<p>"When you apply?"</p>
<p>Mwamba nodded. Noah: "Got it! The commander can be... intense."</p>
<p>Mwamba grinned, "E-xact-ly... Later!" With his last words, he ran off to the distance, the rest of the team watching.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eunie: "We made it to the rendezvous point faster than I thought we would." A huge tree located near a cliff. A bonfire was burning below the tree. Around the tree in a circle were small rocks, similar to that of the path, with grass growing by the side of the trail leading towards it.</p>
<p>Noah: "Mwamba did help us a lot along the way."</p>
<p>A levnis parked at a distance the opposite direction of the cliff{{footnote: Noah's front is the cliff, his back is the levnis.}}, Lanz: "Mwamba's team... They're not here yet." Scratching his head, he don't understand how he could be faster but not yet arrived.</p>
<p>Noah explained, "Martha's squad was leading the way. They'll be at a different rendezvous point, I expect." Double tapping his temple, he checked for new information on the iris. "The mission hasn't changed. We'll stand by round here till the scheduled start of the operation."</p>
<p>Eunie acknowledged and suggested: "Roger that! Should we grab a bite to eat?"</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Good shout!" Then, Lanz and Eunie walked up to the bonfire. Noah still stuck and deep in his thoughts, as Riku prompted: "Noah... Something up?"</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, "I've just got this uneasy feeling... It won't go away."</p>
<p>Eunie and Lanz turned to face him, Eunie: "The thing we were talking about before?"</p>
<p>Lanz preferred not to think too much: "Mate, you're thinking too hard, as usual. Think it could just be the pressure weighing on you a bit?"</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, as if to shake the feeling off, "Heh, yeah, maybe." Soldiers could be seen behind him, standing at watchpoint, some patrolling.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh, for snuff's sake." He and Eunie walked up to Noah, "We've still got a bit of time. How about blowing off a bit of steam with a quick sparring sesh?" Looks like they gave up the eating break.</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't too happy with his decision, "Huh? C'mon, we've got the operation soon. Shouldn't we just rest?"</p>
<p>Lanz disagreed, "Nah, this is exactly the sort of time you want to get your heart rate up. Nothing like going toe-to-toe to get out of your head. Really helps you focus."</p>
<p>Riku: "Never mind empty-headed proposal of Lanz, Noah."</p>
<p>"Shut it, fluff-bag!"</p>
<p>"Riku vote for having mindful moment in quiet place. Checking in on state of self!"</p>
<p>"OK..." Noah turned to Lanz, "Thank you, Lanz. Why don't we train a bit now so we can give it everything in the battle?"</p>
<p>Lanz was excited Noah took his idea to heart: "Nice!" Eunie just shook her head and shrugged, like everyone's out of their mind. Riku flapped his wings.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-2"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-2">Footnotes</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-operation-ouroboros-and-moebius"><a class="header" href="#the-operation-ouroboros-and-moebius">The Operation, Ouroboros, and Moebius</a></h1>
<p>A few hours later. The sky already turned dark. The glimmer of fire sparks lit their proximity. Noah checked his iris: "It's almost time. Let's review the details of the operation. Our mission objective lies in Alfeto Valley. An unidentified ether source has been reported. We are tasked with surveying it and destroying it."</p>
<p>"Waypoint marked out on map now. Please to have look at waypoint on map!" Riku added.</p>
<p>The party nodded. Noah continued: "The advance party should have already arrived at the planned contact point."</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's time we headed out too, then!"</p>
<p>Lanz was getting excited: "Let's get the snuff out of here. A royal decree, eh? I don't know about all this... But let's get out there and square it away as quick as we can!"</p>
<hr />
<p>It was foggy. A few specks of purple particles floated in the night sky before disappearing into inexistence. As they ran to above a ledge, they got down to check the situation: "It's really supposed to be here? I don't see much," questioned Lanz.</p>
<p>"Shh" With his iris, Noah scanned the horizon. Agnian levnises came into vision. One, like before, its torso floated on a rolling ball, it's arms equipped with blades. Another levnis is slightly larger, floats in the air, looked like someone wearing a white coat, with two balls attached to its shoulder joints. "Agnian troops."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Seriously?"</p>
<p>Noah: "They're still far off. They haven't spotted us."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Goin' in?"</p>
<p>"We don't have permission to engage. The only thing we need to focus on... is our target." {{footnote: Noah looked back at him from the tip of his sight, before turning back to look at the Agnian troops.}}</p>
<p>As he tried to transmit information to other squads with his iris, an error screen popped up, with a message: "Communications down due to <strong>black fog</strong> interference."</p>
<p>He turned and pointed to a faceless soldier, whom came forward: "What?"</p>
<p>"Heads up. Enemies at two o'clock. Go tell the main force. I'm worried about Mwamba and the others. I think we'll go on alone."</p>
<p>"Ok then. I'll handle it." The faceless soldier ran back where he was, where other soldiers and levnises were, while Noah and his team crossed to the side, a ledge for them to enter the lower areas.</p>
<p>Reaching the bottom of the ledge, they knelt down while Noah scanned the horizon with his iris. A "commence mission" popped onto the center of the screen. Kevesi levnises started firing their cannons onto mid air... no, it hit an invisible ship floating in the sky. As fires raged at point of impact, the invisible shield cloaked it from outside view.</p>
<p>Agnian levnises weren't late to join the party either. A few blast and the invisible shield almost lose its invisibility status.</p>
<p>Noah, watching from his position, questioned: "Is that it? It's not Kevesi... Definitely not Agnian either..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "The spark is that?"</p>
<p>One more hit, the invisible shield was zeroed. A ship came into view, floating in the air, army green seen under the blast' illumination, looked like a space ship combined with a submarine. Several pixels of of light emanates from the side, aggregate in 3 groups. It's rocket engine that gave it forward thrust emit a yellow-orange hue.</p>
<p>As it released its legs, the tip resembles a rocket-engine nozzle, which they could tune the direction as it land.</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's coming down."</p>
<p>The landing wasn't entirely a success. As it crossed a ledge, it's belly smashed on the ledge. Sparks and flames engulfed the point of contact as it lose balance and smashed into the dirt, dragging along for a distance before coming to a stop. A ring was ejected from one of the pixelated light group.</p>
<p>The Kevesi and Agnians, seeing their target down, did not went first after the target but after each other. Beams and bullets exchanged, levnises destroyed, soldiers killed.</p>
<p>Lanz exclaimed: "Starting without us!"</p>
<p>Noah: "We need to keep moving. Head to the target."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You got it."</p>
<hr />
<p>It wasn't a smooth ride. Noah and his team just destroyed a ball-bearing Agnian levnises. They were panting. Yet, more Agnian levnises and soldiers were seen from behind where they'd engaged. Noah and Lanz turned, ran towards the soldiers, each blow downed a soldier. An Agnian levnis not far away in a trajectory shoot its blade towards Noah. Lanz ran up and activated the shield, which the blade bit into, turning itself like a drill before the shield shattered. The Agnian levnis was about to continue when it suffered beams from a nearby Kevesi levnis, destroyed it.</p>
<p>Lanz and Noah exchanged glance, ran off in opposite direction. Lanz summoned his blade and swung at the 3 soldiers whom blocked his way.</p>
<p>A levnis knocked some Kevesi soldiers down. Eunie stuck her staff onto the ground, a green ring encircles them, healing them. As if she sensed something, she squeezed her staff through her armpits, aiming backwards and fired. Two agnian soldiers at the top of the ledge behind her was shot down before they could do anything. She turned her staff back toward the ground, an orange ring replaced the green, the soldiers seem to increased in strength.</p>
<p>Noah hopped off a ledge while the last Kevesi killed. Several Agnians approached him in a fan shape formation, with one ran forward and exchanged hits while the other watched. {{footnote: Movie always have some stupid scene. In real life, you'd have outnumbered them in the first place, not letting your colleague wasting their energy in a duel, and not giving your enemy any chance.}} As Noah repelled him, he calculated a series of blows and executed them thereafter as the Agnians turned into husks.</p>
<p>As he looked at his iris, he noticed his flame clock filled up: "My Flame Clock... It's filling up... but..." The "lives" weren't moving in any particular direction, nor the flame clock levnises nearby either. An unexplained phenomena.</p>
<p>As they regrouped, Noah lead them towards their actual target. A robot sharing a head and a torso, face towards them, it's 3 beam of lights which made up its face flickers for a moment, determined they're enemy, and started firing bullets at them. Noah sliced some bullet away while Lanz raised a shield a second later. The automaton stopped firing while reducing its distance with another <strong>automaton</strong> that joined it.</p>
<p>Eunie: "What <em>are</em> these things?"</p>
<p>Riku: "There no pilot inside!"</p>
<p>Lanz changed stance to offensive: "They're automatons."</p>
<hr />
<p>(A while later, battle completed)</p>
<p>The battlefield raged with flames. Beams were still being exchanged. With his iris, Noah located their target, a bright green blob of light.{{footnote: It actually emanates a ring every second, like how the GPS blue dot when it showed location.}} "Is that it?"</p>
<p>Nodding to the others, they ran towards it.</p>
<hr />
<p>Kevesi and Agnians teamed up against the ship's crew. Boxed fell out of the ship earlier piled the area. Large and small flames rose from the ground in the distance.</p>
<p>A muscular man was hiding behind boxes arranged like a barrier, firing at enemies with his machine gun, got down to catch a breathe. The dark night, plus him wearing a pair of goggles, could not render his facial features; we could only see his moustache and a thick hair. "Damn it! Fighting both of 'em? That's gonna be a tough break. But what did I expect?"</p>
<p>The source of ether, an egg-shaped structure, some space split its upper and lower part of its shell. Ether lines were distinctive characteristic. "They'll do just about anything... for our precious <strong>Ouroboros Stone.</strong>"</p>
<p>He wasn't alone. Two others in a fan formation behind boxes firing at enemy from forward direction.{{footnote: Behind them was a cliff so high that no enemy was there; maybe they could if someone climbed up and sniped down...}}</p>
<p>As one automaton went down, one of his colleague, dark skin, oval face, wearing an eyepatch, signaled to the muscular guy,"<strong>Guernica</strong>! That's the last of the Automatons! We won't last long!"</p>
<p>The other guy wearing glasses kept firing. Guernica looked at him, shouted: "The battle unit's still holding. (paused) Go, save yourself! Get that Stone to the <strong>City</strong>!"</p>
<p>"Argh!" Just as he finished his sentence, the eyeglasses guy suffered a blast, dead on the spot. Guernica whom continued firing, eyed the situation, "Zuo!"</p>
<p>As he made his way towards Zuo, he heard another shout: "Arrrghhh!" It came from the eyepatch colleague.</p>
<p>Guernica looked up onto the ledge where bullets hit his colleague. Agnian soldiers were lining up, pointing their guns at him. He made a few shots that brought them down. That's the last of 'em, Kevesi and Agnians. No more faceless soldiers, no more levnises at where he was.</p>
<p>Guernica quickly ran towards the eyepatch colleague, almost dead. He put his hands on his shoulders, the guy brought his hands up and put it on his palm. "Guernica. S-sorry... I should... have been more... perceptive..."</p>
<p>Guernica wrapped both his hands around the eyepatch guys' hand, as if to reassure him. "Yew!" He coughed, head fell to his side, and that's the last of him. "YEW!!!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and his team approached their destination, hid behind tree barks. Lanz scanned for details with his iris, "There it is. The ether source."</p>
<p>Eunie: "First there was those Automatons. Now another unknown weapon."</p>
<p>Noah and his team learned a lot of new things today: "What in the flames... are we even fighting? No, not just us... Agnus too..."</p>
<p>Guernica laid beside the Ouroboros Stone, "So you made it this far. It'll have to be here."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Noah. Look." She was pointing to Guernica.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Is that... a man?" {{footnote: Yes, they never saw a man outside of Kevesi and Agnian. That was their whole world.}}</p>
<p>Noah stood up: "He's no Agnian soldier. What is he? Was he controlling those Automatons, maybe?" He dugged low as he emerged from his hiding place, made his way towards Guernica. Suddenly, paper cards flew at him. Eunie saw him in danger, got out and pointed her rifle{{footnote: Eunie's weapon is a staff-rifle, on one end, it's a staff, on the other end, it's a rifle.}} at the Agnian soldier, wearing a helmet. A paper card floated behind his left shoulder, cut into the shape of a dove-shaped kite, with eyes encarved within it.</p>
<p>The agnian soldier, suffering shots, hid himself behind tree trunks while bullets swooshed past.</p>
<p>From another direction, an agnian girl wearing a helmet, white dress with orange linen{{footnote: one of the standard Agnian soldier suit}}, two semicircle rings with its sharp tip glowing yellow.</p>
<p>Lanz drew the machine gun encapsulated within its broadsword and fired at the girl. The girl was agile, dodged all his shot as she made her way towards him, jumped into the air toward Lanz while he brought his sword up to block.</p>
<p>Noah's sword cut at the point of contact, separating the girl and Lanz. Her team, the guy and another girl carrying a massive hammer, so massive it could fit her inside{{footnote: translator think she's probably less than 1.5 meters, assuming Noah around 1.7 meters, and Lanz 1.9 meters.}} if it was hollow, in wedge formation.</p>
<p>"Kevesi troops..." The double-ringed girl sounded.</p>
<p>"Three of 'em." Said the hammer girl.</p>
<p>"It seems... we are just about the only ones left." The card weapon guy spoke, and turned his head at the Ouroboros Stone, "And there's our objective."</p>
<p>"Noah," Eunie signaled.</p>
<p>Noah, seeing they had no choice, raised his blade in affirmation, "Yeah. We'll have to fight."</p>
<p>The card guy: "Mio."</p>
<p>The girl with high agility, double-ringed weapon, <strong>Mio</strong>, agreed, "Got it."</p>
<hr />
<p>(Some fights later)</p>
<p>As Noah sliced his blade, it shattered Mio's helmet into pieces, revealing her face. Her silver hair was short, reaching her shoulder. Her yellow-ochre iris gleamed in the darkness. Her ears stuck towards the top of her head, resembled that of a cat. Her broken helmet did not stop them from exchanging hits.{{footnote: A stupid scene here, Noah ran right into a flame and emerged unscathed, can you believe it?}}</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guernica looked from a distance. "These kids are gonna end up stealing each other's life force..." He held his hand up, clenched into a fist, "And me... I've robbed them even of that kindness."</p>
<p><strong>Memories:</strong> Guernica was piloting an automaton-like robot, but larger, torso stick out, handling a gatling gun{{footnote: Like how you handle a tank when a soldier got out its top and handle the gun}} and firing it at the Kevesi soldiers.</p>
<p>The hammer girl, her helmet already broken, emerged by Mio's side, jumped into the air, about to slammed into Noah. "Huh?! Where did...?!" Noah was shocked as he didn't see how did she appeared from behind Mio.</p>
<p>"Call that a swing?" Lanz sounded and emerged from behind Noah, set up a shield while her hammer smashed onto it. "You're way too slow!" She shattered the shield while Newton's Third Law brought her back up into the air.</p>
<p>"He blocked it! No way!" Her shocking face did not prevent her from back-somersault to land beside Mio. We could see she was slightly tanned, with visible blue veins on both her arms, while characteristically a blue flame lit one side of her hair, as a feature, not a bug.</p>
<p>Suffering the blow wasn't easy for Lanz either, "Gah! For a little munchkin, she sure packs a real wallop!" He had to shook the numbness off his right hand.</p>
<p>A distance away, Eunie was dodging the array of dove-like cards, as she hid behind a rock, looking at the guy, also lost his helmet: "Urg... How many of those cards has this geek got?!"</p>
<p>From a distance, we see cards flying around him in circles. He put his hands to his nose and pushed his black-frame glasses up, a stereotypical 'genius dude'. He had tanned brown skin, thick hair. "There's no escape! When my <strong>Mondo</strong> have you... They'll follow you to the ends of the world!"</p>
<p>As he finished his sentence, he swiped the Mondo at Eunie, some transformed into bird shape, others remained kite shape, flew at her. "Spark that! Why don't you back off?!" Sticking her staff onto the ground, she sent an invisible shockwave that shattered the bird shaped Mondo, while other Mondo we didn't saw their fate. The guy protected his face from the back-flying burning cards, awed: "ahh (gasp)... How did she fool my Mondo?!"</p>
<p>Eunie ran off while shouting from the distance, "Creep. Try followin' that!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mio and the hammer girl landed behind him, as he turned towards Mio's direction. Eunie stopped beside Noah and Lanz; Noah exclaimed, panting: "These guys are tough..."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed: "I hate to say it, but I think you're right."</p>
<p>Lanz: "These are no grunts. That gear... Special Forces?" He was pointing towards Mio's weapon.</p>
<p>Eunie agreed: "Yeah, deffo. That'll be why they've got an off-seer with 'em."</p>
<p>Mio ran towards them while Lanz prepared his machine gun, saying: "Well, so are we! Even-stevens, Right?!"</p>
<p>The Mondo backed Mio up while she made her way to the team. One slice knocked Eunie off to the side, as she concentrated on Noah. Noah spoke to himself while he was busy blocking, "How can she react so quickly?! Can't seem to... hit her!"</p>
<p>As his sword traversed her ears, a sharp-pitch sound generated from the sword damaged her ears. She held up her left hand to soothed its pain, holding another at Noah.</p>
<p>"What's... What's that sound?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Note from the translator: <strong>For this rest of this section, Noah's and Mio's thoughts would be rendered in italics.</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noah continued to analyze the situation while they exchanged hits: "<em>She's so fast... And yet... her moves are really simple... It's almost... like they have a rhythm...</em>"</p>
<p>The word "rhythm" reminded him of something: "<em>The Agnian off-seeing tune? I know how that goes...</em>" He looked at her steps, counted, "<em>One, two, three, four... One, two, three!</em>"</p>
<p>Noah turned to the side, ears facing Mio. Mio was shocked at his action, "He's not even looking at me?!"</p>
<p>Noah relied on the tempo rather than his vision, "<em>One, two, three, four... One, two...</em>"</p>
<p>"There!" He gripped his blade, sliced his sword vertically as Mio jumped back just on time. Some pieces of her shirt fell off, in shocked, "<em>He hit me?!</em>" As she landed, Noah thrusted forward and sent one of her ring flying off into the air, which she caught as it fell back down, still awed: "Why you...!"</p>
<p>As they exchanged blows, Noah's brain managed to catch an empty window for clear thinking. "<em>Hang on...The fighting's stopped?</em>" He looked and listened, no sounds nor sights coming from the distance. Lanz and the others were seen exhausted, lending support from their weapons while bending forward. Only Noah and Mio continued their fights, "<em>When did that...?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>At this rate, one of us is going to get killed... No, maybe both of us will...</em>" He stopped moving forward, need time to think, "<em>Something strange is going on. We shouldn't be fighting like this.</em>" Unconsciously, he spoke out: "We should run!" He immediately realized what he had spoke from his unconscious, shock-ridden: "<em>Run? Was it... me who just said that?What is this? There's no time to think.. Have to trust my gut... This is all too real! I hope I'll be able to...</em>"</p>
<p>Mio was seen gritting her teeth, stopping to face him. "<em>get through... to her...!</em>" She didn't stop for long before running towards him. As he blocked her attacks, spoke out to her: "You are an off-seer! From Agnus, right?!"</p>
<p>"What the...?"</p>
<p>"So you are, then! Why are you fighting me?"</p>
<p>"As if you can talk?! You're the ones attacking us! What, too scared to fight now? Too late!"</p>
<p>"It's not to do with fear. It's that sound... You can hear it too, I know you can!" He raised his voice on the second sentence.</p>
<p>Mio could only replied with a standard reason, "We're fighting because there are enemies to kill! You think we'll just let you go?!" Meanwhile, Lanz and the others continued their exchange.</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Ugh...! This is bad... At this rate...!</em>" Then prompted while thrusting his sword forward, "Is that all you have to say, Agnus?"{{footnote: Eunie was seen firing a shot at the Mondos, which lined vertically like an array of shields}}</p>
<p>Noah landed a hit which Mio blocked, shouting to her: "I'm telling you..."</p>
<p>Mio shouted back: "Enough! I'm telling you that you're full of it! Take that!" His sword thrusted towards her, just a few centimeters from her neck. Her ring thrusted towards him, short of his torso. Both dodged aside as they flew and looked at each other, sliding on the floor with their trajectory before turning and got up.</p>
<p>"Do I really have to kill her? But she's so fast... If I lose focus for a second, I'm done for!" Noah was questioning himself.</p>
<p>Mio wiped her sweat from her chin, speaking to herself: "These Kevesi off-seers... I thought they were just window dressing. But he's different... And there's his sword... What's up with that?"</p>
<p>Noah's sword, a blue ring joined its handle to its blade. While the outer blade glowed in blue, vibrating at a fast pace, it's skeleton was filled with green liquid.</p>
<p>Guernica took notice of his sword, a situation he hadn't yet understood: "Uh...? What's that?!" Looking back at the Ouroboros Stone, lit with the same color as Noah's sword's skeleton, realized: "Ahh I see... I s'pose this is the reason I'm here then, eh? Heh! Guess this is what they call fate. Fine then. Time for Guernica Vandham... to make an entrance!"</p>
<p>As Noah and Mio's face glared close to each other, eye for eye, Guernica unsheathed his flare pistol, pointed it towards the sky and fire a shot. The flare shoned so brightly that Noah and Mio look from the tip of their eye toward the flare, and saw Guernica jumping right at them, both his hands pressed against their torso, bringing them to the ground. As Noah exclaimed: "What the...!"</p>
<p>Guernica asked, continued pressing them to the ground: "What do you all think you're doing? Why the fighting?!"</p>
<p>Noah didn't get it{{footnote: Or maybe, he was focusing on getting away from his grip, so he can't think properly.}}, "What's this... guy saying?"</p>
<p>Guernica pressed him back into the ground, "Just why? Answer me!" Lanz and the others, seeing their situation, ran from both flanks of Guernica and stopped at a distance.</p>
<p>Mio used her reply as a chance to get back up: "What do you mean, 'why'? If I see an enemy, I fight! So don't you... interfere!!!" With her final word, she broke free from his grip, landed in front of her teammates. She ran forward, trying to finished Guernica first, but before she could slashed her weapons, Guernica fist punched her stomach while she lost her strength to remain standing, pressing her whole weight against his fist for support.</p>
<p>Guernica lower his hand a bit before letting her fell to the ground, "Pull the wool from your eyes, kid. Think about your real target: that thing!" He pointed at the Ouroboros Stone, and put his fist on his chest, leaning forward, "And me!"</p>
<p>Turning to face the others, he continued, "No, you just have your little scrap. D'you have any idea, who the real enemy is?" He held his fist up high into the air, "It's over!" He punched down to the floor, sending a shockwave. Dirt, Noah, Mio, and dust particles rippled away from the point of contact.</p>
<p>His hands dangling from his shoulder while he stood up, continued his speech: "Now. Is that all you need to fight? Truly? That's all?" He looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>The Mondo guy immediately replied, "Of course. Countless comrades have lost their lives, thanks to this filth." He nudged at Noah's team direction.</p>
<p>Lanz walked forward, looking at Mio's team, "Oh really now? I could say the exact same thing. What'd you think it's like for us? Losing friend, after friend..." Mio's team raised their blade in a defensive stance in case he march towards them. "You steal everything from us!"</p>
<p>Eunie got up and lined up with Lanz, "You think we're even just because both sides do some killing? What good's filling up these flickering Clocks in our eyes! It'll never replace the friends we've lost. That's why!" Her right eye revealed the flame clock as she spoke to them.</p>
<p>Noah reasoned from behind: "We aren't fighting because we <em>want</em> to."</p>
<p>Eunie was awed, darkened the flame clock and looked back at him, questioned, "We're not?"</p>
<p>Noah walked forward: "We can see our lives written before our eyes. Fighting is all we have! Is it any wonder... we lose loved ones? Or have to take them from others?" As he stopped beside Guernica, "All of us... We have to fight so we can go on living!" {{footnote: Perhaps this was the thing he had been thinking about for so long, lost in his mind without ever saying it out.}}</p>
<p>Mio drew a breathe at his conclusion, never thought about it before.</p>
<p>Noah looked to the side, raised his voice and questioned, "Just who decided that this was how it should be? If I knew who they were, or where, I'd..." He paused to think what actions he would want to take, while Guernica interrupted him.</p>
<p>"I know who they are. You'll what?" He went up to him, shadowing him. Noah's eye lit up as he heard that he had an answer.</p>
<p>Noah looked up at him, while Guernica scanned his attire, prompted, "You're an off-seer, eh?" He put his hands on his chin, like when you're thinking. The blade was emanating the sound Mio heard just now. "I guess I can trust you with this. You better listen up now." He walked up to him and slightly touched his chest with his fingers. "'Cause the face of your real enemy is..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, a glowing yellow object the shape of a scythe pierced him in the chest. As the object emerged behind his torso, purple specks released into the air, several purple electricity flowed through his torso while he fell to the ground, groaning in pain. The Mondo guy was first to react, his Mondo flewed past Noah and his team while the rest turned to face the direction.</p>
<p>Thud, thud, thud.{{footnote: "er ung, er ung", FRENCH, NOT ENGLISH pronounciation of the alphabets, the sound of the joints of robots when they walked due to air pressure applied on the piston. }} A monster, it's chest had two rings, with a smaller ring inside, displaying a "infinity symbol" (or moebius strip). Leaf-like lobes and incision carved into its both sides, emanating a dark blue glow, probably its arms; walking towards them.</p>
<p>From behind the bark, Mwamba's body first appeared, dangling, as Noah immediately reacted, "Mwamba..."</p>
<p>Mwamba looked at Noah, having a hard time replying, "N... Noah! I... I messed up..." The creature probably waited for him to finish his sentence before emerging from behind the bark. Mwamba was held on its right hand. With a brighter background light and angle, we could see some crystal-like structure emerged from its shoulders. It had two horn resembling a bull's horn, sharp jaguar-like eyes like those of the red-suit guy we seen during homecoming. It's skin dark red, like those of the red-suit guy. We could see its teeth as sharp as razors. It had rings on its torso, as if it was playing hula hoop.</p>
<p>His left hand gripped an Agnian, "Mio...H... Help me, Mio...!"</p>
<p>"Hackt!" Mio shouted back.</p>
<p>As it walked closer, Noah's blade reverberate at an even higher frequency, to which he almost can't grip on it. "My Blade... What the...?"</p>
<p>He looked up{{footnote: no time to figure out what the heck is going on with his blade}}, hearing Mwamba's and Hackt's groans, "Mwamba?!"</p>
<p>The monster did not stop. Lanz's voice was shaking, "Wh-what is that thing?!"</p>
<p>Eunie replied, "Never seen anything like that before..." Yet, recalling from another hyperspace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Eunie's unknown memories</strong>: A monster similarly resembled this, but without horns, flat head, jaguar eyed but glowing purple, brought it's sharp yellow-glowing nails in front of adult Eunie. Smoke rising from the distance. A tall rock seen pierced into the sky in the background.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Eunie! Eunie! What's wrong?!" As Lanz tried to get Eunie's attention back, she gasp as her eyes opened to its maximum and took a step backward. "What is it? Seen that thing before?!"</p>
<p>Eunie didn't understand where her memory came from; it wasn't from her younger self, at her current reincarnation: "No, h-how could I have?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Noah?"</p>
<p>"No, never. This is no normal creature... It's something else."</p>
<p>"Oi, oi! Don't go stopping on my account. Get back to killin' each other! Come on. I thought that was your whole 'raison d'être'?" As the monster spoke, its eyes turned red, an infinity symbol appeared inside its eyes.</p>
<p>Mio was shocked, "It's... speaking?!"</p>
<p>Guernica, badly injured, held his hand by the wound, "M-<strong>Moebius</strong>..."</p>
<p>The moebius continued:</p>
<p>Moebius continued: "What's wrong? Too worried about your buddies to fight?" He{{footnote: We'll assume it's male, for it sounded male-ish, though we'll use "he" and "it" interchangeably, for "it" assumes the "monster," while "he" assumes his gender.}} held them up a little, concluded, "Can't have that! All right!" He held them high up into the air while Noah looked. He pressed hard, they made their final groan as he released his hand, their husk dropped to the ground while he made a series of action that looked like a wolf tearing meat from its prey.</p>
<p>"Mwamba!" Noah shouted. Mio gasped.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Grgh, you scum!"</p>
<p>Moebius: "Oh, wow. This is some entertainment." He signaled at the Ouroboros Stone, "Two rival factions, murdering each other over one little rock." Then, he held both hands towards the Ouroboros Stone while walking taking a few steps towards it: "Well! Your objective is staring you in the face! Try and take it! 'Course, you'll be dead before you can lay a finger on it." Then, stopping at a series of ledges, he put his feet on the first ledge, hands supporting on that feet while he sat down on the second ledge. "Don't you just love it? Don't you wanna savor it? The sweet taste of a life cut short!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ngh... You mudder!" Lanz and Eunie can't stand it anymore, both running towards him.</p>
<p>"Wait, Lanz! Eunie!" Noah shouted back, but they don't seem like they could calm down, so he had no choice but to run after them.</p>
<p>On the other side, Mio was enraged and started running towards him too, "You killed Hackt!"</p>
<p>The hammer girl was worried about her, running up behind, "Mimi!"</p>
<p>The intelligent guy probably thought it wasn't intelligent to make such move, but he, like Noah, had no choice but to run after them: "Spark!"</p>
<p>Guernica struggled and got up. He managed to get onto the manually-controlled robot which he brought with him, it's thrusters activated as it got up from the ground, warming up. He was sitting in the controller's seat, seen from the glass windows.</p>
<p>The moebius shot his fingernail at where Noah and Mio team ran, hit the ground, sending smoke rippling outward, covering our view. As he stood up and slashed its finger at Noah, Lanz got in front of him, it's fingers almost knock on his broadsword.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Guernica's robot flanked him, like how he flanked Noah and Mio earlier, pressing on the moebius's chest as they dragged along. It's other arm, clearly resembles a grip, punched towards the moebius, whom held his right arm and caught the grip. "Hmph. Well... What did I expect?"</p>
<p>The robot, about three times the size of Moebius, wasn't holding on to its torso. It stood up, threw the grip to the side, while gripping the arm of the grip with both of its arms, swinging it with himself as the center of rotation. "That's about... all you're... good for!" About half a round, the robot's arm broke off, sending the machine flying in a short distance. The moebius still gripped onto the arm, which he threw to the side.</p>
<p>Guernica, seated in his seat, called back: "Well, crud. Helluva throwing arm. But y'know... I ain't... takin' that lying down!" The other robot arm, equipped with a gatling gun, fired at the moebius as he walked towards the robot. Most of the hit missed. Some that shot, he deflected them to the side by flinching his arms. Then, he pointed his fingernails at the robot, it glowed more yellow, and shot. The robot bursted into flames.</p>
<p>Like a frog, he jumped forward and punched into the driving seat, shattering the glass. Guernica groaned in pain. Noah watched him sticking his hands through the windows, grabbing Guernica out and held him up dangling.</p>
<p>Noah: "Leave him alone..." His right eye glowed blue, and he ran towards the Moebius: "Let him go!" On his mark, the others (including Mio's team) quickly followed behind. The Mondo guy actually stopped for a second to think before he make his way.</p>
<p>Noah jumped, his sword seemed to slice the moebius' hand, whom released Guernica witha few red "lives" burst from the point of contact. Noah hit the floor beside Guernica.</p>
<p>"Tsk. Don't get on yer high horse. You're nothing more..." The moebius got angry, standing up, a ball of purple energy ball glowed from his left hand with electrical current flowing on its surface. "than a grunt!" He jumped mid-air and punched in front of the ground where Noah was, sending him flying backward. Lanz was in his trajectory and stop him on his track, after which Lanz summoned his blade.</p>
<p>Moebius: "You've got a real death wish. Maybe I'll take care of you first! How 'bout that!" He pointed his fingers up, nudged Noah and the others.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Halfway through the fight)</p>
<p>The moebius slid back, jumped into the air, his yellow fingernail shot towards the ground right in front of the hammer girl. A purple electric emits from it sent her flying backwards. Eunie ran towards her, casted a healing ring. She climbed, with her feet knelt on the floor, looked at Eunie: "Uhh... Thanks for that."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't appreciating it, "Pfft... If you're done thanking me maybe you can get up!" She continued, reload her rifle and pointed it at the moebius and shoot, "We have to beat him together or we're dead in the mud!"</p>
<p>The moebius didn't even bothered blocking, letting it explode in his face. He was busy breaking Lanz's defense. Two hits and his broadsword flew off his hand. The moebius brought both hands up, a purple energy ball gathered, and smashed it towards him. The Mondo guy got in front of him, his Mondo arranged in defensive form, blocked the ball of energy on time. Red and black particles emit from the point of contact, red electricity flowed across the mondos.
Signaling to Lanz: "Get out the way! You're just slowing me down!"</p>
<p>"Tch... The nerve on this guy!" Lanz gritted his teeth, swung his broadsword at the legs of the mondo guy, which he retreated his mondo and jumped to prevent being hit, and the moebius slid back for the same reason.</p>
<p>As the battle continues, Guernica crawled on all fours towards the Ouroboros Stone. He supported himself with both hands on the egg{{footnote: the Ouroboros Stone, egg-shaped.}}, then start punching the top of the egg with his right fist continuously. "Start working...! Wooork!!!" Blows he landed more furiously.</p>
<p>After a few punches, he talked to the egg, which isn't responding: "Ugh... If you don't start up soon..."</p>
<p>As if it listened, its upper shell starts cracking aside. Seeing his success, he continued his course, landing a hit with each phrase, "Those kids...!" Each harder than before, "And the world!" It's almost fully cracked open, as it started revealing a bottle with metal mesh. A second later, blue particles and smoke emanates from the gap, it's force sent Guernica fell on his back.</p>
<p>He didn't mind a bit. He had succeeded, "Ahahahah! That's what I'm talkin' about. Looks like it wasn't all for nothing!" The egg opened up, it's upper shell sliding downwards, covering its lower shell, fully revealing the mesh bottle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the moebius swing around and send his fingernails, hitting the ground before Mio as she fell. "One down, good start!" The moebius walked up to her, his fingernail thrusted towards her. She was still on the ground. Noah emerged from the left and deflected his fingernail, looked back at Mio, before grabbing her by the neck to help her move out of the way. A few steps later, she fell on the ground while they looked back, the moebius just took a step forward, shadowing them. It raised its left arm up, prepare to thrust his fingernail at the two, "Two for one!" Mio stood up behind Noah, whom pointed his blade at the Moebius.</p>
<p>Just before the fingernail sliced through Noah and Mio, Guernica got up again, his palm on the metal bottle, and press it downwards, which totally activated the egg. "It's not over yet!!!" Green ether in gaseous state blew off, like a high pressure liquid whom found a hole to release its pressure. As the gas flowed over Guernica's body, we saw his soul threw up into the air, separated from his body.</p>
<p>A moment after the first ripple, the ether, initially only showering Guernica, expands with the second ripple and hit Noah and the others, also sending their soul out of their body. Time seemed to stop as their soul rose into the air, with the egg still releasing ripples of energy.</p>
<p>Focusing on Noah's right eye, where Eunie displayed the flame clock earlier, the flame clock changed shape and form a full circle, materialize into a clear shape, like a blue snake biting its own tail. In its full glory, Noah's soul was brought into a world filled with yellow clouds.</p>
<p>"The off seer?... Really?" He saw several Mio's memories. A Mio was playing her flute. Another Mio at the top left look at where he stood. "<strong>Miyabi</strong>?..." The top left changed picture into a girl, which we'll assume it's Miyabi. The middle was the hammer girl lowering her head, fence in the background, rose her head, "This is what...". Miyabi appeared on the bottom right corner too. "Such a waste..." "Mio..." The central image changed to Miyabi, handing Mio her flute.</p>
<p>As fragments and fragments of Mio's memory swapped and filled the yellow clouds surrounding Noah, he managed to catch a glimpse of her past. "Mio, take this. I'm giving you my whole self. So please. Let me..." "Miyabiiiiii!!!" Mio shouted in the final scene Noah saw.</p>
<p>Mio was in the same situation as Noah, except she saw his memory surrounding her instead. Her left eye, originally holding the Agnian flame clock, demonstrated a yellow snake-biting-tail ring. "Stop crying then!" (Noah telling Joran in his memory.)</p>
<p>As we zoomed out, we see them reflecting on the ground. If you try stand on a mirror and look down at yourself, that's just exactly how they stood, except if Noah look down, he would saw Mio in the mirror. They were separated by a thin sheet of transparent floor, but didn't look at each other.</p>
<p>As memories swirled around, two separate yellow tornadoes encircles and engulfed both of them. They disappeared from head and leg towards the center of their torso. The final product was two ball that resembles like the Chinese Golden Elixir (金丹){{footnote: Unfortunately, the translator don't know if there are anything that resembles the Chinese Golden Elixir in the English world.}}. These two ball, Noah's blue, Mio's yellow, slammed towards each other, releasing a bright yellow ball of light as they collided. As the light dimmed out, a top-shaped core appeared, which we'll call it the <strong>Ouroboros Core.</strong></p>
<p>The ouroboros core looked like two bowls capped on top of each other, covering its content, forming a toroidal shape. Each "bowl" had 3 circles, one at the tip (like the bottom of the bowl), one at the top like its circumference, and one in the middle, which you can imagine a circumference drawn between the top and the bottom.{{footnote: If squashed on a flat 2D surface, it'll look like the tree's concentric ring.}} Between the top and the middle, various inscriptions too complicated to put into words carved its surface. The two bowls don't touch each other, hence some space in between.</p>
<p>As the ouroboros core emerged from thin air, blue stripes encircling it, the moebius covered his eyes, perhaps seeing the bright light from before. A purple-shaped monster materialize from the core, immediately punched the moebius whom slid backwards, fell a tree, before hitting on the cliff wall.</p>
<p>"What did I just... do...?" Noah was confused by his actions. He took up his arms and looked at it. It was purple in color, with some veins resembling blood vessels on its surface, orange fluid flowing within it.  Such orange veins formed a ring on his wrist. As he flipped his hand to look at its back, four such veins stretched from in between his fingers towards his wrist. "What...? This hand..." Then, both Noah and Mio sounded: "Is it... mine?"</p>
<p>He and she turned back to look at his/her teammates. They were in their defensive stance, as if (s)he was their enemies. "Huh?" Noah and Mio gasped. "H-how are you inside me?!"</p>
<p>The Ouroboros core was located at their chest, a ring stretches like a hula hoop dangling by the neck. The face had some furs by its neck. Eyes sharp, glowing brightly yellow-orange. There was a larger eye-looking feature on each side of their temple. As energy flowed through the veins, it glows brighter; as it leaves, it returned to its dimmer glow.</p>
<p>"Inside...? Hold on... Are we...?!"</p>
<p>As they stood up, we could see a tentacle dangling towards its back. It had a single horn, like that of a unicorn, pierced from its head. There was a sword sheathed on its back.</p>
<p>The moebius fling its right arm, throwing the tree bark to the side, exclaimed, "Well, you sure catch on quick." He stood up, laughing, "So, you got yourselves an <strong>Interlink</strong> going, eh? Guess I've gotta give the old fool credit where it's due."</p>
<p>As he spoke, we could see steam rising from the ouroboros core. Its skin color glow and un-glow at a rhythm. Looking at their arms, Noah and Mio prompted to the moebius, "Uhh.... Interlink?"</p>
<p>The moebius walked up to them, explaining{{footnote: Probably he was enjoying the time, so he don't mind spending some time explaining what was going on to them.}} "Well, whatever. That form you just merged into? It's called '<strong>Ouroboros</strong>'. Sear that into yer skulls."</p>
<p>"Ouroboros?"</p>
<p>The moebius didn't wait for them to absorb the information, continued: "Oh, and... Me, I'm Moebius. We look a bit alike, don't we? When Keves and Agnus come together in unity, you're practically one step away from being on the same level as us." He opened his arms, as if to welcome the new Ouroboros.</p>
<p>Noah: "So we're..." then Noah and Mio: "One Being...?"</p>
<p>The moebius continued, "Ehh, to put it bluntly, you're failures. Fact is, the two of us are mortal enemies."</p>
<p>"Enemies?" Noah and Mio unconsciously get into defensive chance, as their soldier instinct, hearing this word.</p>
<p>The moebius seemed like finished his explanation, or perhaps, out of patience, didn't wait for their reply either: "You got the picture? No further questions? Then let's get back on the dance floor!"</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-3"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-3">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-death-of-guernica-vandham"><a class="header" href="#the-death-of-guernica-vandham">The Death of Guernica Vandham</a></h1>
<p>The skin of the ouroboros now glowing bright pink. A punch sent the moebies into the air, while it leapt towards it. As the moebius did a sit up mid-air, the ouroboros appeared behind it and smashed it back into the ground. Dust rose at the collision point, blocking our view of his status. The others watched the battle. Guernica was breathing heavity. Red grass tiled their battle location, while taller grass, the top of its tip looked like grain, glowing dark blue, less concentrated than the red. Mountains surrounded the area.</p>
<p>The ouroboros landed as the moebius walked out of the dust. "Hahaha! Pretty good! Weeell, what a tough'un. Enough. We'll say I lost this one, yeah?" What dark-blue flows through the moebius then now flowed orange or bright yellow. He pat dust off his right shoulder while walking towards the ouroboros.</p>
<p>"Who is he talking to?" Mio questioned, to which Noah answered, "No idea. But..."</p>
<p>The moebius laughed so hard as if his lungs were falling out, as he continued, "Got a parting gift for you. Don't worry, there's plenty to go round."</p>
<p>He looked up into the sky, eyes projecting red laser as the moebius strip/infinity symbol glows bright red against the dark misty sky, so bright the surrounding mist glowed dark red. Red particles seemed to flowed into it. From a ledge afar, at the other side of the mountain, a red-suit humanoid with a purple core in its chest that we seen earlier from the Homecoming, presumably a moebius untransformed, watched the sign afar. At an even further place, beside a standing rock, another red-suit moebius watched the sign. A humanoid with several strips of red flowed from his/her arms, and some in his/her torso, long hair against the fog-ridden sky, had no difficulty seeing the glowing red, like a satellite. Around the sky, we could see some sparkles of electricity in the thick clouds.</p>
<p>Back at the battlefield, as the moebius strip flared, he told them: "And now, the whole world will be your enemy." The others looked at the symbol, nothing they could do to prevent it. "I wonder how your lives will turn out. I'll enjoy watching you." He gripped his left hand before teleporting away, transforming into purple particles that evaporated without a clear direction. Purple fog emerged where he evaporated from.</p>
<p>Steam rose from the ouroboros skin, and an emergency sound that symbolizes core overheating can be heard. "Who in the... Who even was that...?" Noah questioned the identity of the moebius. Reaching their maximum, The ouroborus disappeared in blue particles, while Noah and Mio, separated, reappeared as blue particles and strips materialized them mid-air, faling to the ground thereafter. They looked at their hands, then glanced at each other.</p>
<p>Eunie first saw their transformation, exclaimed: "N-Noah!" Lanz followed her glaze. Lanz asked as they ran towards him: "W-was that... Was that you guys just now?"</p>
<p>From the other direction, the mondo guy and the hammer girl ran towards Mio, "Mio, what's happening here? What's going on?"</p>
<p>Mio herself was confused, "I... don't..."</p>
<p>Eunie suddenly reacted with a gasp, sending anxiety signal to everyone. Eunie, Lanz, the hammer girl, and the mondo guy went into defensive stance, pointing their weapons at each other.</p>
<p>Guernica was walking step by step, each step more difficult than the last one, hands covering his wounds: "Hold it right there! You guys... Put away your weapons. You aren't... You're not enemies... now..."</p>
<p>"We're not?" The hammer girl questioned.</p>
<p>"Then..." Before the mondo guy could asked for more, Guernica made an action that resembles spitting blood into the air, as he kneeled, fell forward onto the ground. Mio, concerned, ran towards him as Noah followed; the rest followed behind, weapons unsheathed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mio and Noah, each holding one side of Guernica, laid his back on the ruins of the manual robot he controlled earlier, before taking a step back, knelt-sitting{{footnote: If you know how Japanese sit before a low table in the past, it looks like a knelt, but perhaps not exactly.}} before him.</p>
<p>"Thanks..." He put his hands onto the glasses he was wearing and took it off. The glasses, so huge it covered his forehead, a few centimeters thick, and the protruding of the glasses like one that would be wore by a scientist. Below it revealed a face old with wrinkles, a huge nose, moustache around his mouth and chin up to his ears. Two thick scars made a cross on his face, intercepting between his eyes, above his nose. He was wearing an eyepatch that covered his left eye.</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked by his facial features: "His skin's all wrinkled."</p>
<p>"Yeah." By now, Lanz and the others already sheathed their weapons.</p>
<p>To which Guernica replied, "Haha. It's called getting old, this."</p>
<p>"Old?" Noah and the others seemed not to heard of the phrase before.</p>
<p>"Well... Must be your first time, huh. Seeing a human... like me, I mean." He scanned the group. Speaking without stopping seemed to burnt his wound, "Urg..." He groaned in pain as he tilted his head backwards and closed his eyes to soften the suffering. Mio was concerned, moved a bit forward, but didn't take any actions thereafter.</p>
<p>He continued: "Well then. Looks like my plan was a success."</p>
<p>Eunie prompted: "What plan?"</p>
<p>"You six... You're now Ouroboros. Check the Flame Clocks in your Irises. Do they look different to you?" They looked at each other, Eunie and Lanz, Mondo guy and hammer girl. Noah gasped before Mio, her looking at him.</p>
<p>"Ah! Huh. Now you mention it..." He turned to face Mio, the ouroboros symbol flaming in his right eye. Mio exclaimed, "Our Flame Clocks have changed shape?!"</p>
<p>"You see it? That's the <strong>Ouroboros Ring.</strong> Guess I did good... entrusting this power to you..." Mio sighed. Guernica focused on her term symbol located on her neck. "That mark there... Late tenth term, eh? Three months left. Till your Homecoming - that about right?"</p>
<p>She put her hands up, as if to touch the term symbol, but put it down.{{footnote: An extra description of Mio. She had a core at her chest, diamond shaped, split upper-left-half magenta, lower-right-half cyan.}}  "As for the rest of you... You're probably about 2 years off, right?"</p>
<p>Having a clearer look at the term symbol, let's update our belief. The term symbol wasn't comprised of an outer diamond and inner diamond. Instead, it had five diamonds with a single dot at each of the diamond center. Except for the center, the other diamonds had a long tail that lay parallel to one side of the central diamond, forming what one called an <em>outer central diamond</em>. Hence, the original central diamond we'll called the <em>inner central diamond</em>. Followed by a dot in the center. The parallel line description don't changed. Mio only had the central dot red; while the others had the inner central diamond <em>and</em> the central dot red.</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." Guernica breathed out, "Me? I've been alive sixty years. Or should I say sixty terms, by your counting. Yeah. I've been alive six times longer than you lot. This is how people are really meant to be."</p>
<p>Black fog fills the darkens sky, itself already brighter than since they fought Moebius. "Listen, folks... That's not all. There's still... something else that needs to be done." As he breathed out, his chest droop down, his head tilted forward. "You guys... You wanna survive?"</p>
<p>He forced his head up to meet eye contact with the others, "Live on? Hold the torch?"</p>
<p>Mio haven't considered it deeply, turned to look at the other direction, as if feeling guilty about it. "You kids don't need to be fighting each other. Not... any more. But... that doesn't mean you get to relax. From this moment on, those Moebius bastards are never gonna leave you alone. Because now, kids... You share a common destiny. They'll hunt you constantly, relentlessly, without rest."</p>
<p>The sky brightens again as he spoke. Except for the cliffs, we could see trees without much leaves; those leaves left were grey. Vines climbed rocks at certain places.</p>
<p>"Even so... There's one place that might give you a chance: <strong>Swordmarch</strong>. The land pierced by a great sword. You gotta find our hope... Our City... It's the only way you're gonna defeat the real enemy... And reclaim what was lost..."</p>
<p>Behind the hammer girl stood a pinkish Nopon, wearing a white hat, with a wok attached to her back.{{footnote: Riku had a sword-like structure attached to his back.}} Some yellow glowing fluid like blood vessels of the wok constantly flow outwards, the "window" lined the outer circumference of the wok.</p>
<p>"The way the world, and life... should be. And listen." Yellow particles start floating out of Guernica, his skin lightly illuminating. As he spoke, more and more of the particles got released. "Don't give up. Ten years? You kids deserve better. The only thing that can change all this... is the will of Ouroboros... You kids, and you alone..." With his last phrase, he totally particlize{{footnote: pronounced "particle-lize".}}. Only his shirt remained, no husk. Yet, even his shirt glowed yellow after he particlize.</p>
<p>Mio and the others looked as his particles floated up into the sky. She stood up, drawing her flute out from her back pocket. Noah saw her action without doing anything. Eunie looked at her: "Hey. Is she..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah. An Agnian off-seer."</p>
<p>The melody played as she brought it to her lips. Noah, reminiscing, reached for his flute, stood up, while the agnians watched him joined her.</p>
<p>Mio opened her eyes and looked in his direction upon hearing a different melody, withdrawing her flute a second later. Noah missed her melody, opened his eyes and sent an affirmative nod to play together. Mio then continued.</p>
<p>Both of them closed their eyes and concentrated on the melody. All floated particles, yellow or red, changed blue in the process. Guernica's shirt now lay flat on the ground, of course emanating blue particles. So too the soldier's husks located around the battlefield. Even the black fog could not dim the lights the blue particles emanated.</p>
<p>Lanz reminisced: "Mwamba..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So close to making it..."</p>
<p>The agnians sighed.</p>
<p>As their joint melody came to an end, Mio looked to Noah with grateful eyes, "Thank you. For doing this with me."</p>
<p>"Well... This is what we're meant to do. To send on the voices of the departed, is an off-seer's purpose..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's memories:</strong> By a cliffside overlooking the evening sky, rocks protruding in the distance. Miyabi stood beside Mio and told her, "To send on the voices of the departed is an off-seer's purpose..." Blue particles rose into the air around them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the moment, perhaps it reminded Mio of what she don't want to reminisce, quickly nodded and ended the topic: "Right."</p>
<p>Lanz discussed with Eunie for a while and signaled to Noah, "We're leaving. Noah, Eunie." The he walked off, Eunie behind him.</p>
<p>Noah turned to look at him, asking, "What's up?"</p>
<p>Both paused and looked at him, Lanz explaining: "The mission's over. We've got an obligation. Need to report the sitch."</p>
<p>The mondo guy walked up a distance behind Mio and agreed, "As do we. Time to withdraw. Mio, <strong>Sena.</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio was still stuck in the hopes of Guernica, immediately turned to them and proclaimed, "Huh? But..."</p>
<p>The mondo guy snapped, "'But', what?"</p>
<p>Mio breathe out, "Come on, <strong>Taion.</strong> Don't be rude."</p>
<p>"It's hardly the time for pleasantries." He pushed his glasses up as he explained, "We lost a great many of our comrades. We have to inform those still in the Colony."</p>
<p>Lanz, complaining: "And we're any different? If you snuffheads hadn't come charging in..."</p>
<p>Taion was heated up with Lanz, "Indeed? Well, why don't we settle this here, right now?"</p>
<p>Eunie agreed, "Yeah, bring it! I reckon I could go for some payback!"</p>
<p>As Lanz moved forward, Noah moved up, his hand held up to block his trajectory, "Lanz." Lanz looked at him.</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"That's enough."</p>
<p>"What d'ya mean?!" Lanz and Eunie weren't satisfied with his reply.</p>
<p>"There's no point."</p>
<p>Lanz raised his voice: "Seriously?!"</p>
<p>Noah looked at Mio, putting down his hands, "Before, when she and I transformed, I felt her thoughts... or maybe her memories. There were so many. And then they were a part of me. There were so many different fragments... Hard to tell them apart. But even then... I understood. She's..."</p>
<p>Mio was looking down, probably around the ground where Noah's feet was. "She's lost a lot fighting us... Keves too away so much. She's experienced a lot of grief."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Transformed... You mean... the big'un?"</p>
<p>"Yeah," Noah nodded and looked at him.</p>
<p>Mio looked towards them, "I felt it as well. Your grief... It was like mine."</p>
<p>Taion rebutted, "Yeah, well..."</p>
<p>Mio didn't let him finished, turned to look at him, raising her voice to cut him "And in one of those memories...!"</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>"Is something that could be our fault." Mio's voice filled with anxiety. "That's what it's like... in war, I suppose." She turned away, facing down, couldn't met Taion's visual contact.</p>
<p>"Hm" Taion turned, pushing his glasses (again!!!){{footnote: The snuff with this genius pose.}}</p>
<p>Riku walked forward and asked, "So, what is plan from here? Sun kind enough to show face, but will hide again if this drag on."</p>
<p>The cooking pot Nopon flapped its wings, letting her jump up the height of Sena's head twice. "True, true! Time is wasting itself."</p>
<p>Noah made the decision, "You're right. Let's go. A lot's happened, but that seems best. You made the right decision, Lanz. Sorry. For confusing things." The surrounding already turned bright.{{footnote: We could see undergrowth with red leaves growing below trees, which one couldn't clearly describe how it looks except one single flexible trunk with long leaves shaped like a ship sticking out of its trunk.}}</p>
<p>"Ahh, don't worry 'bout it." Lanz shook his head.</p>
<p>"Mio, shall we leave it at that?" Taion prompted.</p>
<p>"Um. Yeah."</p>
<p>Then turned to face Lanz, "There you have it. I <em>sincerely</em> hope for your safe return."</p>
<p>Lanz: "You take care too. Take care not to die in a ditch somewhere, that is." Then he walked off past where Taion was, Eunie followed behind. That's the direction to Colony 9.</p>
<p>Taion speak from the tip of his vision, at Lanz, "The next time we meet, it will be as enemies. Don't forget that." Lanz paused his step, Eunie turned to look at Taion.</p>
<p>Lanz waved his arms in the air, "Hah! Don't worry, I've got a good memory," and continued walking off with Eunie. Sena saw them off.</p>
<p>"Hmph." (breathing out from his nose hard). Taion then walked in the opposite direction, Sena followed, Mio still standing still.</p>
<p>Noah looked at Lanz and Eunie for a while, where Taion and Sena already behind him. He took the step first, past Mio, whom quicken her step to not face him. A short distance and they both slowed and stopped, turned and looked once more at each other. She was already looking at him. In a moment, she turned away first, took steps to her group, and he followed a moment later.</p>
<p>Maybe what just happened was like the sea of mist surrounding them, appears in the break of dawn, but as the sun rise, disappeared into inexistence.</p>
<hr />
<p>A blue flame clock levnis, half-filled, its eyes shone bright red against the misty sky. It looked like Colony 9, but one can't recognize. Where its wheel was located, a bridge stretched toward a ground, allowing entry into the levnis. The flame clock levnis had its right arm resembles a beam cannon, one extremely huge. Barriers were set up beside falloffs. We could see one barrack, two tents, each with one or more table. An oil lamp was seen under both tents. The street lights were still turned on. Soldiers were chatting, walking around, or in their post.</p>
<p>The commander of Colony 9: "It's the enemy... The enemy's approaching." Faceless soldier, triggered, turned to look at his direction. Those sitting down stood up. Their Irises, including the commander's, glowed red. So red that the orange screen covering their eyes could not cover its glow. "Our sworn enemy..."</p>
<p>Behind the commander, a Moebius with a huge helmet, and a "W" stuck on top of its forehead, stood with his arm crossed. He probably hijacked their mind as long as the red in their irises don't go away.</p>

<p>As they traverse the route back to the colony, Riku walked up to be between the other three, sluggishly: "Ahhh (yawning)... Riku so sleepy... Could do with long soak in bath."</p>
<p>Eunie teased, "Oh, to be a carefree Nopon."</p>
<p>Lanz encouraged, "Just hold out a little longer. We'll be back soo-... Oh!" His face turned into a smile. From a distance, Kevesi soldiers with red irises marching towards them. "Look, friendlies! Hey! It's me! Lanz from-"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a bullet flew past a head.{{footnote: He would have died if he hadn't dodged as fast as his battle instinct brought him.}} Soldiers marched in rows towards them, the front row aiming their guns and firing relentlessly. By this time, the group hid themselves behind a rock protruding from the valley's wall. Soldiers from the second row summoned their blade.</p>
<p>Lanz can't believe what just happened. He attempted to signal his identity, "Cut it out! We're your friends here! From Colony 9!" To which his reply was a bullet carving some pebbles out of the wall they're hiding at.</p>
<p>Eunie: "They're not listening, Lanz!"</p>
<p>Lanz was infuriated, as if being misunderstood, "The spark? Don't they recognize us?... Noah, erm..."</p>
<p>As soldiers marched towards their location, Noah had limited time to assess the situation. The first row stopped a few hundred meters away, the second row surpassed the first, marching towards them with their blades. Lanz reminded, "Noah!"</p>
<p>Noah made a decision: "We'll just have to fight back!"</p>
<p>Lanz raised his tone: "Fight back? You crazy?!"</p>
<p>"Just... don't kill them." Then, he walked out of the cover. Lanz and Eunie followed, Eunie: "Oh, is that all?!"</p>
<p>Riku too: "Easier said than done."</p>
<p>Noah: "Whine later... It's time!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As they fell the last soldiers in their reach, the first row soldiers, whom stopped at the next tiny hill, fired their guns at them. Lanz raised his shield, confused, "Crap, what is going on?! We're on the same side!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "They keep coming, Noah!" More melee soldiers surpassed the first row, whom continued their shootings, while the group ducked behind where they hid before.</p>
<p>As Noah recalled the moebius's words: "And now, the whole world will be your enemy. I wonder how your lives will turn out. I'll enjoy watching you," he seemed to understand what he meant, murmured, "The world our... enemy...?"</p>
<p>Eunie didn't understood the sudden murmur, "Huh? What was that?"</p>
<p>"If we get any closer to Colony 9, we're just going to end up getting surrounded. We've no choice. We're gonna have to head back!" The others nodded in agreement. They ran into the distance in the midst of gunshots.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, Mio's team weren't in a better situation, either. As they ran from blaring bullets, agnian soldiers, their iris blood red, followed. They managed to take cover as the path turned right. Taion was observing the soldiers' status while Sena questioned, "How are they so good at finding us?!"</p>
<p>Mio wasn't any clearer than her, "What's going on here? Taion?"</p>
<p>"I..." He continued his observations. As the soldiers approached, he noticed the blood red iris, emotionless face, "That light... Is that...?!"</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I'll explain later. Right now, we need to focus on getting out of here." The others agreed. They continued their path.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note  on environment:</strong> Where they battled the moebius just now, the ground paved with red grass, low undergrowth with red leaves that stood about a meter or two, a waterfall somewhere, surrounded by cliffs, habitats to volffs, eagles with 4 wings (two above the other two, called "quadwing"), almost bald trees with their rare leaves dyed silver, some deers like those from Yzana Plains, is called <strong>Melnath's Shoulder</strong>, located in the Aetia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As Mio's team entered Melnath's shoulders, an agnian soldier got in their way. She stopped right in her path, "Oh no! Guess they knew we'd come here..."</p>
<p>The Gamma{{footnote: "Gamma" means "Colony Gamma".}} Soldier: "You're the ones that raided the Colony! I ain't lettin' you get away!" He drew his halberd and pointed at them.</p>
<p>The pink nopon, <strong>Manana</strong>, exclaimed, "Oh! Someone having real bad mood..."</p>
<p>Sena: "But why...? It's like nobody recognizes us..."</p>
<p>Taion: "As of this moment, the point is moot. Clearly, we ought to prioritize our physical safety."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"Sena! Come on. You don't want to get slaughtered by our allies, do you...?"</p>
<p>Mio: "I don't get it at all... But we can't go back to Colony Gamma with things like this. Taion. Is there somewhere we can hide out?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I suppose where we bade farewell to our new 'friends' might do."</p>
<p>"Understood. Let's try to slow him down at most."</p>
<p>"Exactly my thoughts."</p>
<p>Sena's emotion: "(sob)".</p>
<hr />
<p>Where Guernica's ship were previously. Eunie was sitting on the ground, leaning on one of the box. Lanz leaned on a taller box, standing. Riku stood by his side. Noah sat on one of the boxes. As Mio's team approached from a distance, she stopped for a while, surprised yet unsurprised their new friends were here.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah raised his head to register their presence.</p>
<p>"What?" Sena, with a surprising tone. Sena and Taion wasn't as calm as Mio.</p>
<p>Lanz boringly exclaimed: "You lot..."</p>
<p>Noah and Mio had eye contact, being quiet. Perhaps, they hadn't thought of a reunion so fast, after all the memories they shared.</p>
<p>The morning sun shines bright, illuminating the valley. The clouds skirted the top of the hills. A day passed, and it turned night.{{footnote: This, we used the 2nd video described in the prologue's notes. <strong>Because time is changeable in the game</strong>, the first video moved from night to day; while this we referred to switched vice versa. Though, one'll add extra description from the first video, because features are easier to spot than during the night.}}</p>
<p>Hours passed. The kevesi hadn't changed their position yet. Mio and Sena were sitting opposite them, on two of the boxes, Taion standing, with Manana by his side. Taion prompted: "Much as I love a friendly reunion... What exactly are we doing here?"</p>
<p>Lanz instantaneously reacted: "Yeah. Beats me. I'm starting to get antsy here."</p>
<p>Mio: "Mmm. What he said."</p>
<p>Taion, with a heavy tone: "And how do you suppose we feel?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Taion, don't be like this... Reel it in a little."</p>
<p>Mio was focusing on Noah. He looked at the floor, sorting out the information they had, as Guernica's voice stood out: "You guys... You wanna survive? Live on? Hold the torch?" Then, he opened his mouth, "Good question."</p>
<p>Mio: "What?"</p>
<p>He stood up and announced: "Guys... Let's live. Let's survive."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What kinda pep talk is that? 'Course we're gonna survive!"</p>
<p>"Well then... We know where to go. The City."</p>
<p>Lanz stood up straight to focus, looking at him: "The Cit-?! What are you even..."</p>
<p>He turned and faced him, "In the eyes of the world at large... we're outlaws now. We can't... go back to the Colony."</p>
<p>Both groups recalled how they were chased down by the soldiers. Their determined fire, to go after them until they die. Taion: "The soldiers... Their Irises glowed blood red. Just like his did."{{footnote: The moebius irises.}}</p>
<p>Mio: "Right, I remember."</p>
<p>"This is just conjecture, but what if... those soldiers are perceiving us as enemies?"</p>
<p>"Because of the red Irises?"</p>
<p>"Correct."</p>
<p>Lanz rebutted, "But... what's even up with the Colony? Did that freak do that? How?"</p>
<p>"We don't know the method, but it's logical to think he did something."</p>
<p>Noah tried to convince his Agnians friends: "That's exactly right. That's it. So, instead of going off our separate ways, we stand a better chance... if we all work together. Right?"</p>
<p>Taion was dumbstruck for a second, "I suppose I can't deny that."</p>
<p>"If we are gonna be running, we might as well have some kind of aim, right? People on opposite sides, working together. Do you see?"</p>
<p>Eunie asked, "You're saying we can survive that way?" Noah turned to her and nod.</p>
<p>Lanz was still living in the Old World, "Dude... What are we doing about the Homecoming?"</p>
<p>He turned and faced him, "Lanz. Are you being serious?"</p>
<p>Lanz stuttered. Noah continued, "Come on. You have to understand... If you still want to go after all this, I won't stop you. But... before you do..." Noah turned and look at the Agnians, Lanz following his glance, "You'll have to kill our friends here."</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>Sena stood up, and together with Taion got into a defensive posture. A few moments later, Noah continued, "Is that even... how our lives are supposed to go?" He turned back to face Lanz.</p>
<p>"Remember that ceremony, long ago?"{{footnote: He was referring to the Homecoming they saw when they were young.}}</p>
<p>"But after our Homecoming, what's left?"</p>
<p>Lanz thrusted forward, "Think of the praise they got, up there! Up on that shining platform."</p>
<p>Noah glanced down, replied, "To me, it was like a pillar of husks."</p>
<p>Lanz gasped, took a step back. "A terrible altar... built upon countless lives... You want that as your legacy? You're really OK with that?"</p>
<p>Mio eyes widened. Lanz leaned back onto the boxes, hands crossed. "Well... what'd you want me to do?"</p>
<p>"I can't... answer that for you. I don't know everything. But we need answers. I say we go out... and find them. I want to know... Why were we entrusted with these powers? What did he mean by, the 'real enemy?'"</p>
<p>Mio: "So... the City?"</p>
<p>He turned to look at her, nod, "Yeah."</p>
<p>Sena sat back down, turned her look at Mio's, "What did he say? 'A land pierced by a great sword'?"</p>
<p>Eunie recalled something, "Oh, right. <em>That</em> sword. Y'know, that massive one, way down south."</p>
<p>We couldn't see anything against the night blanket of stars; but in the morning light, a sword seemed to made of rocks pierced in the distant background, it's features faintly seen.</p>
<p>Mio recalled: "<em>Defeat the real enemy, and restore the world to order.</em>" She held her hand up in agreement, "Well, then... I guess you can count me in!"</p>
<p>Taion looked at her: "Mio?!"</p>
<p>"I think... I'd like to trust that man. Besides, how can we even fight any more, after all we've been through?" She spoke as she lowered her hands, exchanging glances with her teammates.</p>
<p>Taion disagreed, raised his voice, "They are the enemy!"</p>
<p>Mio, sternly: "They <em>were</em> the enemy." He recalled what Noah's group had done, fighting by their side, with the Moebius. He looked at the side, away from her glance.</p>
<p>"OK! I'm with Mimi on this one!" Sena raised her hand too. Both girl smiled back on him, hoping for his support.</p>
<p>Taion looked away, putting his hands on his waist, stuttered, "I-it may be to our advantage. I'll admit that, at least." They looked back to Noah's group. Noah and Eunie faced Lanz.</p>
<p>Lanz don't seem prepared to compromise, turned his head around, "Oi, what's that look for? Don't just stare at me. It's creepy."</p>
<p>To which Noah replied, "We're gonna need an answer soon."</p>
<p>"Do I even had a choice?" He tilted his head downward, closed his eyes, then raised his arm in refusant.</p>
<p>Noah turned his attention to Eunie, "Guess there's nothin' for it!" She raised her hand as she replied, breezily.</p>
<p>Noah nodded: "Good!" He jumped onto the obstacle where he sat before, overlooking his new expanded team, and introduced, "My name's Noah. Colony 9, Special Forces Unit. As you know, I'm an off-seer. These three, Lanz, Eunie, and Riku, are my long-term friends. Oh, and..." He pulled out his flute, looking at it, "This is my passion. Someday I'd like to play my own melodies. Not just... the same old music that I learned in training. Ok!" He tucked it backed into his pockets.</p>
<p>Lanz was perplexed, got up and looked at him, "Uh, what is this? Feels like a surprise inspection or something..."</p>
<p>Noah put his feet on the ground, "It'll help. In the long run."</p>
<p>"Come on, man... Really?"</p>
<p>Mio smiled, then stood up, "I'm called Mio. I'm an off-seer in Colony Gamma's musical unit. Erm." She scratched her head for a moment, probably boasting "I can do the hundred metri in seven seconds. Pretty quick on my toes, I guess."</p>
<p>Eunie was amused: "You go, girl."</p>
<p>"And... I keep a diary." She retrieved her diary out from her back pocket.{{footnote: Yeah, they got a secret tunnel in their back pocket that can store infinite amount of things, of any size.}} She held it with both hands, enthusiastically, "I like writing down what happens. I never miss a single day!"</p>
<p>Eunie got up, "Eunie's the name. Special Forces Unit, Colony 9. We act as Noah's escort. Me and the boys? Inseparable since we left the pod. My special move's Group Heal. It's great at healing my allies all at once. My hobby..." She looked to the side, thought for a while, before looking back, "Collecting Fourtune Clovers, I guess."</p>
<p>Sena stood up, in a lively but stuttering voice, no doubt she was shy: "And I'm Sena! I-I've been Mio's roomie, uhh... ever since I was posted to Colony Gamma!" She turned to face Mio, seeking for affirmation. As she scratched her head, "My special move... I'm just crazy strong... I guess?" Then, she bent her elbows as if to show her (invisible) biceps, "I don't look it, but I can lift far more than my own weight!" As she put it down, "My hobby is... lifting!" She ended with a jiggle.</p>
<p>Eunie found Lanz a buddie: "Oh! There you go Lanz, got a muscle-buddy!" Lanz shooked his head. They all looked at Lanz and Taion. They weren't speaking for the moment.</p>
<p>Taion looked at Mio and Sena for a moment before he sniped, "Tsk." As he compromised and looked at his new "friends": "Well... I'm Taion. I'm part of Operations and Planning in Colony Gamma's survey branch. For this mission, I was assigned as support for the off-seer."</p>
<p>As he paused, Sena tried to encouraged him to speak more, "And...? Go on! Your special move...?"</p>
<p>"I don't have a special move!" The mondo{{footnote: Remember, by his left shoulder, always, in or out of battle}} flapped its wings a little, seemingly disagreed. Then, it looked at Taion, whom looked back, and it flapped once to encourage him. "Urgh... What's the point? Why share details like that? I don't have... hobbies." The mondo look depressed. With the last word, it fell on its back, twisted, while gliding towards the ground.</p>
<p>Eunie smiled back at him: "Wow, Colony Dull."</p>
<p>He walked up front, "Riku! In Colony 9, Riku was head of maintenance and crafting. And... these are attendants of Riku. They at your disposal."</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't happy, complained, "What's this 'attendants' crap?"</p>
<p>She stretched her wings, jumped around, as she introduced herself, "I, Manana! Manana was cookypon in Colony of Mio and others! Manana master of food: stews, baked goods, fry-ups... Can even cook up a mean Gonzalez eyeball!" The last as if to raise goose bumps.</p>
<p>Eunie felt yucky, "Eyeball..."</p>
<p>Sena: "I didn't realize both Agnus and Keves assign Nopon to their off-seer squads. Weird coincidence, huh?"</p>
<p>Taion agreed, "Yeah. Wouldn't have expected similarities there." Meanwhile, Manana was dancing happily. She put her winged arms into the air.</p>
<p>"Hmph..." Everyone looked at the very reluctant guy. Noah had to nudge, "Come on."</p>
<p>He got up from leaning back, "Uh, my name's... Lanz. I'm from the same Colony as Noah. I work as the unit's defense. My special move... Ah, you figure it out! Urgh! Do we have to do this rubbish?"</p>
<p>Noah assumed patience, "Just bear with us. We can plan, now that you've joined."</p>
<p>He still can't accept their circumstances, "So you're acting like we're a team already? Urgh... sparks alive! Fine then. I'm with you."</p>
<p>Riku raised his wings. Eunie was shocked with his agreement, "You totally sure?!"</p>
<p>"What else do I do? Not like we've got much choice." Then he faced Noah, "So, what's our angle?"</p>
<p>"We have made some distance, but we're still in the colony's search zone. Luckily, we don't have any colonies south of here. And you?" He prompted at the agnians, to which Mio replied,</p>
<p>"We shouldn't have any colonies mobilized either."</p>
<p>As Noah spoke, Eunie looked at her clothes she's wearing. Then, she bent down to where she stood, as if to look for labels which describes the box's content. Then, she looked to her right, walked to another box.</p>
<p>Sena: "So we... go south, then?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Noah nod and agreed with Sena. Then, he turned his head to Eunie, "Um, what are you... doing there?"</p>
<p>Eunie was already searching the box. As Noah prompted, she replied frivolously, "Hm? Well our clothes...<em>are</em> pretty filthy. Just wondered if there was anythin' to change into." Then, some shirt caught her eye, to which she pulled it out, "Oh! Fashion and utility!" She held a green and black jacket-like furry clothes between her hands.</p>
<p>Sena agreed, "I need a change of clothes too." She tucked her hands to her back, embarrassed, "'Cause these are, uh... yeah."</p>
<p>Noah pushed for more, "Don't stop at clothes. Have a look around. Take anything that could come in useful.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah lifted one of the metal lid and put it on the floor. We could see several stacks of clothes arranged inside. "Hey... these are all clothing containers."</p>
<p>"Cooking ingredients here!" Manana and Riku found her favorite, her eyes shining stars, "Itchy to get at these!"</p>
<p>Taion searched a box between the two mentioned, "There's one with equipment too."</p>
<p>Lanz searched the one left to Noah. He picked out two gauntlets, "Not exactly equipped to match our setup... Eh, we'll just have to deal." Noah nodded his head, looking at him.</p>
<p>"Hmmm," Taion snorted. Sena saw his reaction, prompted, "What's with the frown? Have they got nothing in your size?"</p>
<p>Taion held out a black pant with copper strip to one of its legs, "Well... This fabric is awfully thin. It doesn't seem very reliable."</p>
<p>Mio rebutted, "You can't expect luxury, can you? Bound to be better than nothing. Unless... you're happy with what you have now?"</p>
<p>Taion can't deny, "N-no, I'll wear it! We all have to make sacrifices."</p>
<p>Sena found something, "Ooh! Y'know, I might be able to rock this jacket!" She brought out a dark jacket.</p>
<p>Mio pulled out one woolly silver jacket with dark collars, "Maybe I'll go for this one? I like the colors." She and Sena exchanged views on each other's choice.</p>
<p>Lanz also found something, "Not exactly the freshest threads, eh?" He pulled out a dark shirt, seemed very small to his size.</p>
<p>Noah: "Maybe it's on the old side, but there's no tears. It'll be fine." He brought out a red one.</p>
<p>Sena: "They've got lotsa funny designs here, huh?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "They sure do."</p>
<p>"Some of the stuff's like... How do you even put it on?"</p>
<p>Noah turned behind and found the girls already put on their desired clothings. They were moving their arms and feet, tucking it into position, possibly getting the buttons done, or maybe just moving around after they wore it to see if it's loose enough to not interfere with battle. Eunie: "Pretty easy to move in this! Score." They moved their hands and feets, testing if it interferes with battle.</p>
<p>Sena, "Oh yeah? Are there any more of those?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Sorry, just this."</p>
<p>"Aww, shoot..."</p>
<p>As Noah moved his glance, he focused on Mio for quite too long. She stepped on the ground to test her new shoes/boots, then pulled the new gloves she got. As if she felt something, she turned back to Noah, asked, "What is it? Not gonna change?"</p>
<p>Noah was taken by surprise, stuttered, "Huh?! Um... y-yeah, I... Hang on!" He gave a quick glance to Lanz, whom nod back as if something was going on. Then, he looked into the box, sounded nervously while he chose his attires. "Still gotta... uh - change my boots, I guess...?" He turned to look at Lanz, ask if asking for support. All the girls were looking at their drama.</p>
<p>Lanz himself got nervous, and stuttered back, "Y-your boots? Uhh... You'll need a hand with those, yeah?" Then, he and Noah turned back and grabbed whatever they chose. As he hugged the stack, he dashed to somewhere afar, with Noah following behind.</p>
<p>Taion almost didn't caught up with them, "W-w-wait, I can help!" He picked up his pace and ran off.</p>
<p>"Ahh?"{{footnote: Mio sounded}} Sena tilted her head to her left, as if to assess the situation, or to look through something blocking her sight of the boys. Eunie: "What spooked them? They could've just changed here."{{footnote: Remember, they showered in a mixed bathroom usually.}}</p>
<p>Sena: "They went pretty far off, huh..."</p>
<p>Mio eyes wide opened: "Ahuh?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku and Manana were flapping their wings furiously, dozens of potatoes, turnips, and some other unrecognizable fruits piled up behind them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Nighttime.</p>
<p>They made a fire and gathered around. Eunie was lying down on a sleeping back, hands behind her head. Right to her head, Riku and Manana were chatting. Below her legs, Noah sat. Behind him, Lanz was doing pushups. Opposite of Eunie, across the bonfire, Mio was writing in her diary. Far to her left, Taion was drinking tea{{footnote: This is a hindsight bias we used, after some thought}}; and between them, Sena was doing pushups. There were some glowing cyan lamp placed around them, which translator isn't sure what that was.</p>
<p>As she wrote, her necks felt sore. She closed her eyes, and looked up, twisted her neck a bit to relief the sore, before looking back down. She was right-handed.</p>
<p>Noah interrupted her as he walked and stood beside her, "Is that...?" Mio turned her attention to him. Both looked at her notebook. On the left, some illegible writings. On the right, with some title at the top, several diamonds chained together. Each chain (each row) contains 5 diamonds, 6 chains (rows) in total. {{footnote: So, \(5 \times 6 = 30 \text{ days} \).}} The first two chains had their diamonds slashed out, and the third, two of them slashed out.</p>
<p>"Yeah. My time left. Heh. <strong><em>Think about it. Wouldn't wanna lose track of time, and just run out.</em></strong>" As she closed her diary, "Today, it's exactly three months... Three more months... and then I'll be gone from this world." She looked down at her diary in her thoughts. Noah looked at and listened to her, without interrupting.</p>
<p>"I've thought about this a lot. About what I can achieve... What I'll leave behind... (sigh)" As she looked up to the bonfire, torso slightly leaned forward, "I've sent off so many... who felt the same."</p>
<p>Noah tried to get in sync with her, "I see... So, that's why you trusted that guy?" To which she nodded. "You hope to... live more?"</p>
<p>She looked up at him, "I dunno," then looked back down, explained, "Doesn't matter."</p>
<p>Noah sighed, while Mio continued, "But... <strong><em>You and me, just talking like this... I think that's kinda amazing.</em></strong>" She looked back at him, grateful, "And if there really is hope... in that place that the man mentioned..."</p>
<p>Noah's eyebrow moved closer to his eyes: "Is that... what you'd want for a legacy?"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio sighed, "Weird question." As the atmosphere relaxed, he went up and sat beside her, armlength distance between. Both enjoyed the silence looking at the bonfire; perhaps feeling awkward and uneasy, as he put his hands on his feet, hers caught on the head of the diary, put on her lap.</p>
<p>Noah broke the silence, "Those who can leave their legacy... Are they content at the end?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" By now, Lanz and Sena had finished their workout. Lanz was sit-sleeping, sitting on his sleeping bag. Both nopons drew out their sleeping bag, far asleep. Eunie still hadn't change. Sena was drinking tea with Taion.</p>
<p>Noah continued, "And the ones left behind... Can they really come to terms with that?"</p>
<p>"That's food for thought. Huh."</p>
<p>"I think about it all the time. What we leave... when we're gone... What that connection truly means."</p>
<p>"Connection, eh?" She sat straight up, both hands withdrew to the center of the diary, squeezed into a fist lightly; her right hand still holding the pencil. "Heavy stuff."</p>
<p>"Yeah." He looked at the sky, "That's life, I guess." The stars looked back at him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Somewhere near the fallen Guernica ship? A girl walked up towards the ship. She was wearing boots, shorts, pigtails. She walked up towards where Guernica's shirt remained, picked up his eyepatch. As she walked off into the distance, the ouroboros stone, previously still have ether flowing through its veins, shutted down completely. An object with three legs, each leg pointed like a compass{{footnote: for drawing circles, the sharp side}}, it's top flat, shaped like a cross, and four red comma-shaped dots at four sides, pointing towards its center, fell off; before, attached to the egg, the center part between its three legs had blue mist glowing.</p>

<p><strong>Mio's Diary</strong>: Agnus and Keves, working together as a team... Taion seems a little dissatisfied, but at the time, <em>his</em> thinking was quite aligned with mine. Finding a path that lets us all live... I will make that my mission.</p>

<p>Flames burning in the night. Agnian levnises rounded up against a Kevesi's, it dropped and exploded. More Agnian levnises marched forward, destroying everything it rolled into. As they moved, they searched for signs of living Kevesi.</p>
<p>The young Noah, hiding behind an obstacle with Eunie, seen the scanning levnises disappeared into the distance. He signaled to Eunie with his right hand, whom nodded her head, then ran off the other direction. Noah followed behind.</p>
<p>Lanz sobbed while he ran, his arms wiping his tears. Noah shouted at him from beside, "Stop crying, Lanz! It won't change anything! For now, just run!" He seemed to listen, putting his arms into a running pose. Riku and another guy (maybe Garland?) were running with them.</p>
<p>Eunie signaled, "Noah! Over here!" She pointed at a direction. "We can go through here, and then we're out!" As she finished, she made a turn to the right.</p>
<p>"All right!"</p>
<p>An Agnian levnises emerged from the junction along their escape route. Eunie cried, "Oh no!"</p>
<p>"Sparks! We almost made it..." Noah exclaimed as they backed down in small steps, away from the levnis.</p>
<p>Too late. The levnis spotted them, it's beam weapon preparing to fire.</p>
<p>Before it does, someone ran above the roof beside it, jumped off the roof, dove down and sliced. In a moment, the levnis bursted into flames as the young soldier covered their face with their arms. Black smoke washed over them. When they looked, a young girl about their age, maybe slightly older, wielding two swords, silver hair reaching her neck, landed on the fallen levnis. She turned and faced the kids. We could now see that she had silver iris, pointed chin. Her term symbol located at her breast.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the battle. Soldiers gathered in 3 to 5 around a bonfire, with many set up. Some walked around. They all were quiet, looking down. Lanz had his hands over his face, as if to hide his tears, or to pinch his nose to silence from crying out aloud.</p>
<p>The silver-haired girl approached, took a moment to catch eye contact with Eunie and Noah before turning her attention at Lanz. She lowered her head, her chin almost touching her chest, "I'm sorry..."</p>
<p>Noah looked up at her, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"If I'd been just a bit faster, I could have saved many more lives..." It looks as if there were tears in her eyes; or maybe, she was just blaming herself. Silence filled the air.</p>
<p>Noah broke the silence, "Uh, who are-?"</p>
<p>She looked up, smiled at him, "I'm <strong>Ethel</strong>, from Colony 4."</p>
<p>Eunie exclaimed, "Silvercoat Ethel...! She pushed her Colony, all the way to rank Silver, and in her third term at that."</p>
<p>"Some do call me that.", then she lightened her voice, "However, a person's worth isn't in their color. It's here." She touched her heart. Noah seemed shocked.</p>
<p>She turned and scanned Noah's blade, still held in his hands, eyes widened. "Nice Blade you've got." Then, she turned and walked off into the distance before he could say anything. He and Eunie watched her disappeared into the night sky.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a theatre. A projector was replaying the fight scene between the ouroboros and the moebius earlier. It's a huge room. The projected screen seemed small compared to it's volume, and perhaps only occupied a-fifth of the front wall. We could see some storey-like structure on both side of the walls,{{footnote: Unsure if people could stand there or just decorations}} with many seats laid on a single floor, like that of a Church, one behind another.</p>
<p>As the screen turns dark, the room lost all its illumination. The moebius that fought at Melnath's Shoulder a while ago walked into the room, still in its gigantic form, "Wow, tough guys, eh? It's a wild ride, this 'passage of fate'. We got ourselves a nice little awakening."</p>
<p>A light shone on a red-suit humanoid, as if she{{footnote: Feminine determined based on voice, and perhaps, one's biases and prejudices on higher tone seemed feminine, though it isn't always true.}} was staged. Her hand by her waist, wearing a helmet that covered everything but her eyes (as usual); her helmet had a ring about her chin, with a crown-like structure above her head. "You were all talk when you left here, but you've nothing to show for it, <strong>D</strong>."</p>
<p>"Oh, spare me, <strong>P</strong>. "After all, I did precisely what I was meant to do." As he finished the sentence, he transformed into the red-suit form. We could see his mask having two horns, with two artefacts dangling near its tips like earrings. The top of the helmet had a flat surface, 45° to the horizontal, reflected light brightly. Behind him, a joker face like helmet moebius was seen... or was it his tail, if he had one?</p>
<p>P: "So? About that <em>huge</em> bet of yours... Pray tell us, who won?"</p>
<p>Another moebius came into the scene. He looked chubby, his helmet seen like a chicken head with a crown from the side. From the front, two fan-shaped horn protruded from the top of his nose. He also had a really high collar, like a wall that blocked a third of the back of his head. "Pah... A draw, I think. And with two whole Colonies on the field! We should've sallied forth in the first place. The whole thing would've been done by teatime. (urghahahaha)"</p>
<p>A new moebius, mouth with a protruding structure that resembles a machine gun, rebutted: "It was J who insisted on it. I'd thought that that had already been communicated." It looked like some semiconductor-colored flat pieces protrude parallel to the top of his head, slightly longer towards his back, like a cap with a tongue wore backward.</p>
<p>A female moebius walked in from behind the machine-gun mouth moebius, from his right to his left. We could see short dangling tentacles (hardened) from her side of her forehead. "In that case... I believe it's my turn next..."</p>
<p>The machine guy rebutted, again: "<strong>H</strong>, I'm pretty sure you already had your kicks the other day when you wiped out Colony 8, no? Surely the turn is mine."</p>
<p>A guy with some purple specks flowing like fire, we could see his long hair, but not other features given that he's not under a spotlight, joined in, "Honestly, you make more noise than the rabble at a feast..."</p>
<p>All the moebius turned to face him, "<strong>Z</strong>!"</p>
<p>"Even if you did stop its raging flow, it will soon burst through. All it takes is the slightest fissure."</p>
<p>"And that is fate... I told you before, haven't I, D?" The moebius whom without a helmet, with red lines forming their body sketches, walked in. This is the special moebius we saw earlier.{{footnote: Recall the last guy whom looked at the projected moebius symbol when they transformed to ouroboros the last time.}} He had an X behind his chest. Behind him, another moebius, also red light shaping his/her body structure, with a "&gt;" symbol but facing the mouth of that symbol facing upwards, carved to his/her chest. As The X guy finished, the X symbol flickered.</p>
<p>D folded his hands around his chest, "Bah... The gang's all here again."</p>
<p>After a moment of silence, Z closed his eyes, the X-symbol guy asked, "K... Will you go?"</p>
<p>A new moebius with round head, like those of a motorcycle helmet, and a fan protruding from his shirt, like those really long collars that stuck out, rising so high it's almost as tall as his head, get into the scene. "If you say I go... I go." As he finished, he teleported, purple particles floating around. Light turned off.</p>
<p>As the decision was made, other moebius teleported away, lights off.</p>
<p>Z: "Well then... Let us see how far the flow brings them this time..." All lights turned off.</p>

<p>The morning sun cast on the environment, brightly reflecting its surface. Lanz, his eyes closed, performing moves that resembles Kung Fu. As if he tries to channel energy towards Sena, "Hnnnnaaaaaaagh!", his eyes opened, sharply focused on her. Sena was no different, random move out of sync with Lanz. "Yeaaaaaaaah!" "Huaaaaaaaaah!" "Wuaaaaaaaaah!"</p>
<p>Lanz new attire, sleeveless T-shirt, equipped with his "power" gloves and leggings, all black. Sena wore a sexy attire that covered only her breast, and shorts, silver gauntlets, leggings, and boots. Inside was very long black socks nearly reaching her hips, and very long gloves that's nearly reaching her shoulder.</p>
<p>Taion, standing where a referree would have stand, watched, softly but sternly spoke, "Guys... What do you think you're doing?"</p>
<p>His new attire, the pants as described before, silvery-white boots, silvery-white clothes, with a line of black running down beside the zip. The collars and the cuff dyed orange. He seemed to wore an inner shirt with long sleeves. An orange scarf wrapped around his neck, it's long side dangling to reach his foot.</p>
<p>Sena actually hadn't noticed him all along, called out: "Oh, Taion. Morning!"</p>
<p>Lanz greeted, in an upbeat tone despite the day before, "Hey! Did we wake you?" Didn't hear any embarrassment in his tone. They continued their moves as they greeted him.</p>
<p>"Honestly, I'm surprised you haven't gone and woken up the whole forsaken continent. So?"</p>
<p>He stopped the moves, Sena followed, to explain his motives, "Oh, this? We reckoned we might be able to do the same as what Noah and Mio did."</p>
<p>"You reckoned? You mean the Ouroboros thing?"</p>
<p>Sena was excited, "Yeah! How badass was that?! We thought if we pulled it off, it'd raise our chances of survival a whole bunch!"</p>
<p>Taion: "And you think it's that easy?"</p>
<p>"Huh? I mean..."</p>
<p>He, with a stern look, walked in between and past them, and faced the rocky walls in the distance. He stopped at the end of the grass patch, just before the shiny smooth-looking rocks that paved the floor. "I don't mean to burst your bubble here, but don't you think... maybe that power's meant only for them?"</p>
<p>Sena rebutted, "Yeah, but that Moebius guy... He did refer to 'us'... I just thought..."</p>
<p>Taion turned to look at her, "You thought maybe you could transform as well?" Sena nodded, though her look was less certain.</p>
<p>"What makes you think it would be you two, anyway? Say it is possible. It could be me and Lanz."</p>
<p>Sena voice got softer, "It's just... kind of a feeling."</p>
<p>Lanz looked at her, brought his hands up, to cut her uncertainty off by reverberating her feelings, "Yeah, just a hunch. Right?" Then, he turned and questioned, "Something wrong?"</p>
<p>"Not at all. Then... I-I guess... that leaves me with her." Eunie, in the distance, was stretching, perhaps she just woke up. Noah and Mio were chatting in the distance, Riku tries to wake Manana up. Belongings lay down on the ground, with Taion's kettle{{footnote: This looked like the modern electric kettle they offered usually at hotels in some countries that translator went before, like Malaysia.}} on one table, a white bottle, presumably holding tea, on another. With a sigh, he shook his head, "I envy you, I really do."</p>
<p>Lanz prompted: "Aw, what're you moaning about now?"</p>
<p>He returned a snide remark, pushing his glasses up (again!!!) "Let's drop it. I don't want us bickering this early. Especially... not now we seem to be sharing a common destiny. We happy few." As if to not look at their reaction, he turned his back towards them.</p>
<p>Sena replied in a lighter tone, but serious, "If I didn't know better... I'd say you were trying to get us all worked up!"</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, "Think whatever you want."</p>
<p>"I think you might be on the mark, though." Mio's sounded from the distance. He turned and saw Mio and Noah walking towards them. Riku, Eunie, and Manana closely followed behind.</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>Noah supported, "We were all there, every one of us. In the same situation."</p>
<p>"Now hold on..."</p>
<p>Noah continued anyways, looking down halfway to recall what had happened, what he felt before, "The only difference was... I was set... on protecting Mio. Protecting all of you guys. And then, I suddenly transformed."</p>
<p>"That's it? That's all it took?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"So you can take that form via a strong desire, or emotion?"</p>
<p>"Possibly."</p>
<p>Eunie said jokingly, "Probably too much to ask of Professor Grump here."</p>
<p>"What, me?"</p>
<p>Eunie walked up to him, "Well, who'd you think?"</p>
<p>"And you any different?"</p>
<p>"What, me?" She stopped at an arm length from him, then burst out, as if she had heard the funniest thing in the world, "Ahah! As if I'm gonna join with you."</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie..."</p>
<p>She turned back and faced them, "Come on, though..."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're not going to manage this overnight. Not the way you all are right now. Even so... It can't hurt to have a little hope, can it?"</p>
<p>Taion processed her sentence for a while, before pushing his glasses up, "Hrm. I suppose there's logic in that." Eunie folded her arms, looked at him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathered around, Noah asked, "OK. Everyone ready?"</p>
<p>Mio nodded in agreement: "Yeah."</p>
<p>Mio wore a silver coat, its sleeve reaching her elbow, with tighter black cuff, possibly fabric that greatly prevents air from blowing right through. A clover-shape orange tie with two short tails stuck to her belly. She wore a sleeveless T-shirt, white with two black stripes running down her chest. A long black socks covering her whole feet protected from the white leggings that reached just below her ankle, tied by an orange strip like how a Karate belt looks.</p>
<p>There wasn't much to describe Noah and Eunie. Noah wore a red jacket, black pants. Eunie, a green plus black jacket, black pants, and white running shoes.</p>
<p>Manana: "Tasty treats... Check!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "I just took a quick look-see, and this equipment seems surprisingly quality." Then, turning to Sena, "Dontcha think?"</p>
<p>Sena scratched her head, in half agreement, "Uh, yeah! Looks that way!"</p>
<p>Noah scanned his team{{footnote: From here on, when we mean team, we mean the expanded team, including Mio and the other.}}. He then turned and looked at the great sword, far beyond the distance, so tall even the hills that surrounded the valley couldn't block their view. The others followed.</p>
<p>Mio: "The 'City' we're headed for... Looks like it'll be a long journey."</p>
<p>Taion activated his Iris: "I've found us a route heading south. Will that work for you?"</p>
<p>All tapped on their temple, Mio appreciated, "Thanks, Taion."</p>
<p>Eunie was surprised, "Hey! You've got some real handy data there."</p>
<p>Mio: "I guess we should head through the caves, and toward Millick Meadows first, then."</p>
<p>Noah: "Chin up, guys. Let's get going." All nod in agreement.</p>
<hr />
<p>{{footnote: This is Variant B of the cutscene. Variant A is similar, which we'll put it in the appendix, including what's the difference between them.}}</p>
<p>Rain poured hard, deafening.  Eunie took her step towards Guernica remains. Where his shirt lies, zip half pulled down, dried blood stained where he'd been pierced. A triangular dog tag hang besides the zip.</p>
<p>"Are these his dog tags?"</p>
<p>Noah, Lanz, and Riku walked up from behind her. Noah knelt by her side while Lanz stood beside him. From the other side, Mio and her team looked down, her hands gripped together in front. Sena put her hand to her heart.</p>
<p>Noah read out the writings on the dog tag, "Guernica... Vandham... I guess that's his name." Thunders roared in the background.</p>
<p>Eunie, looking sad, "That's great..."</p>
<p>Noah wasn't sure what he meant, turned and looked at her, "Huh?"</p>
<p>In a low tone, "I kinda hated the idea of not even knowing who he was."</p>
<p>Noah's vision was on her for a moment, trying to read her feelings, before nodding and acknowledging, "Right, yeah. Let's remember him... as the man who gave us a goal, and the ability to choose."</p>
<p>Eunie finished in a sighing intonation, "Yeah..." They embraced the moment.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> A tall plateau stretched out, like the jaws of a crocodile wide open, stalactites hung like teeth from its bottom, held from collapsing by several pillars. We could see similar plateau in the distance. Very very far away, behind clouds, a tall mountain the shape of an animal, like a reindeer resting, the direction of its "head" facing the great sword. Second scene, we could also see steps of plateau, with a waterfall in the distance. A red vine for climbing from the lower to the upper plateau lurked around its center. The remains like the building emerged from the ground, birds resting on it. Third scene, some rusty remains of a building, demolished, lay together on the ground. Yellow-green grass paved the meadow. Lofty rocky platforms surrounded the location. A waterfall about 3 meters fell from a river to the remain's left, and a brog (purple frog) made the opposite river bank its habitat. Fourth scene, the crocodile jaw platform is at the top right, still a distance away. River flowed beyond the scene. Some blue mantis shrimp roamed the river banks. This, is <strong>Millick Meadows</strong>, of Aetia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group was walking down hill. Lanz and Sena were chatting, leading the way with Eunie. Riku and Manana behind them, followed by Taion, Mio, and Noah far behind. As Noah stopped, he called for their attention, "Hey guys... Could I have a moment?"</p>
<p>"Meh." "Hm" "Yeah? Wassup?" Everyone turned and faced him.</p>
<p>"There's something that I forgot to tell you."</p>
<p>Manana reacted instantaneously, "I-It's about who in charge of din-din duties?"</p>
<p>"No... From now on, I want us to avoid combat as much as possible. So... Keves... Agnus... If either of them decide to put up a fight, don't kill them. OK?"</p>
<p>Eunie questioned, "Not saying I'm against the idea... But why?"</p>
<p>Lanz proposed, "Guess it'd suck having to draw on our allies."</p>
<p>Sena: "Do we just knock them out cold or something?"</p>
<p>Noah agreed and added, "Or get them to surrender."</p>
<p>Taion: "How kind of you."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure our past victims will appreciate that." His hands tucked on his waist, closed his eyes, head slightly facing away from him.</p>
<p>Lanz spit words out from between his teeth, gritted, "You little-"</p>
<p>Noah, sternly and seriously, "We don't need to take any more lives. There's... no point."</p>
<p>To which he sighed.</p>
<p>Noah continued, "There's a reason we met. There has to be."</p>
<p>Mio: "You think?"</p>
<p>"Back then, if we hadn't met each other, we wouldn't be here like this now."</p>
<p>"Even though we're being chased... by both nations at once?" Mio questioned.</p>
<p>"We get chased, we run. Easy."</p>
<p>There was a silent for a moment as he scanned their faces. As he established eye contact with Mio, she replied, "A smart new decision." She nodded in agreement, he nodded back. As he turned his glaze towards the great sword behind him, "We'll keep on running... to that sword." Others focused their sight on the target.</p>
<hr />
<p>The wood melts in the bonfire. Sena and Lanz were sitting around it, about perpendicular to the bonfire. She was enjoying her moment looking at the bonfire, as Lanz broke the silence, "Ugh. Talk about bad blood."</p>
<p>Sena replied in a relaxed tone, "Just give it time. It's early days!"</p>
<p>"Maybe so..."</p>
<p>As she observed his muscles, having some lines carved like leaf veins onto it, she wondered: "Funny pattern you got there."</p>
<p>"You can talk. You've got those shiny chest doo-dads." He look at her chest, a cyan circle core attached. Inside the core, it's as if there were some oily liquid flowing. Inverted L lines glowing cyan stretched both sides on the bottom of it. She also had such lines on her arms.</p>
<p>As if looking at her chest core, she explained, "We've... always had these."</p>
<p>Lanz continued, "You know. I've never even thought of myself as strange before."</p>
<p>Mio sounded from another side, "So many things... taken for granted... We're pretty different, huh? Worlds apart." Mio and Taion walked towards them from a distance, stopped by the table to the left of Sena, with Taion's teapot and some cups on top, standing.</p>
<p>Taion rebutted, turning to Mio "No one's worlds apart. If anything, we should be questioning all that we've thought to be true."</p>
<p>She turned to her back and looked at the distance. Riku and Manana were playing with dirt. Noah was further in the background, lost in his thoughts, his back facing them. Taion continued, "Differences... are all a matter of perspective."</p>
<p>"Hehe... Our skeptics."</p>
<p>From their right, Eunie joined in, threw a question to Taion, "Hey! Are you always like this?"</p>
<p>"Of course. It's my nature." He immediately replied, hands on his waist.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Eunie closed her eyes partially, then turned to face away, "Personally, I think it's easier to take things at face value, you know?"</p>
<p>Taion spoke as his head looked downward, "Now wouldn't that be nice."{{footnote: Translator didn't catch what he's thinking at that moment, nor do one understand whether he means it or not.}}</p>
<p>Eunie was provoked, raising her voice as she stomped towards him, stopped by an arms length away, "Eh? You makin' fun of me?"</p>
<p>"All I said was, it would be nice." Taion patiently replied, eyes meeting hers. Mio stood beside them, Sena and Lanz still sat at their original location, watching their drama.</p>
<p>"Oh-ho-ho, no, you don't!" Eunie didn't seemed to believe his genuineness. "You just called me an airhead, you jerk!"</p>
<p>"This is just... How long are you going to drag this out?" Lanz and Sena looked at each other, unsure about why this couple was quarrelling.</p>
<p>"Far as long as I sparking need to! Until you come clean, four-eyes." Meanwhile, Riku and Manana had just finished meddling with their soil and walked out of sight. Their fights in the distance cut Noah's from his thought. He turned and faced their direction as he heard Taion from the distance, "I can't believe this. Someone shoot me."</p>
<hr />
<p>{{footnote: From this point onward till the end of this section, views will be taken from the 3rd video.}}</p>
<p>After they regrouped.</p>
<p>Suddenly, something caught Sena's eyes. "What's that? Hey, Mimi, you can see the <strong>Ferronis</strong>{{footnote: Ferronis means "flame clock levnis". From now onwards, we'll call it a ferronis.}}, over by the side of the big outcrop there, right?"</p>
<p>They turned to her direction, "Oh yeah!" Hearing of Ferronis, the group got defensive. Taion first checked his iris, "Odd. I don't have any data about a colony established in this locale."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Odd for sure... Noah, take a good look. Isn't it kinda... old?"</p>
<p>As they looked into the distance, it was the rusty junk that laid demolished along the low coast beside the river we saw earlier. They were on high ground, land rolled out below them. "It does look like it's seen quite a bit of service."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah. I don't think they make 'em like that any more."</p>
<p>Mio: "Erm... Do you think it's safe to be around?"</p>
<p>Eunie crossed her arms: "You're freaking me out a bit here, Mio."</p>
<p>Sena: "Sorry!" Perhaps she felt sorry for alerting them on an inexistent threat.</p>
<p>Taion: "I don't think an apology is necessary."</p>
<p>Mio asked him, "Do you think there could be some useful resources and stuff in there still?"</p>
<p>"A possibility, certainly." Then, he turned and face Noah, "It's in the general direction of our objective. Why not investigate it?"</p>
<p>He agreed, "All right. Let's check it out!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As they arrived in the evening, Mio: "Crustips", the blue mantis shrimp, roamed the <strong>Ferronis Hulk</strong>. After they eradicated all the crustips, they rested there for the night.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="consul-k-and-silvercoat-ethel"><a class="header" href="#consul-k-and-silvercoat-ethel">Consul K and Silvercoat Ethel</a></h1>
<p>Inside a workshop. Several Kevesi soldiers overlooking a hanging levnis with two giant copper wheel, two horns 45° pointing at the top, and one facing down, it's head faced down. It was hung by several threads. An faceless soldier was shouting instructions, "No, no, no! More to the right!" The threads hanging the levnis moves with it. "Right there! Start lowering!"</p>
<p>The sound of engines revved as the levnis come down. Thud. Soldiers walked towards it for inspection. He shouted more commands, "Make sure it's airtight. Sand around here? Finer than Ruska flour."</p>
<p>A soldier, thick hair, slightly dark skin, not wearing a helmet, suggested, "I could do a triple weld."{{footnote: A fact, his height is about the radius of the levnis' wheel.}}</p>
<p>"Sure. Long as the output's stable." He gave a green light before walking off.</p>
<p>"Yessir."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a soldier wearing a green hat like that of a nurse, thick hair covering his ears, moved towards a guy half a head taller than him, buff, his hair also thick and long. The tall guy was overlooking some hexagonal-prism-shaped metal containers. As he approached, he asked, "What's up with the K rounds? We're two caches short! Hope you didn't snuff up the order!"</p>
<p>The guy turned and faced him. He had two groups of hairs dangling in front of his eyes. As if being attacked, he sniped back, "I don't know, OK? Got a problem, take it up with logistics."</p>
<p>The guy with the nurse hat, we could see his irises red. He stated, "We're just a Dirt-rank colony, low as they come. You think the Castle gives a crap?" He looked to the other side, slightly lowering his voice with the last sentence.</p>
<p>"Queen's Oath, this pisses me off. We get better scores than any sparkin' colony out there."</p>
<p>The nurse-hat whispered to him, "Did you know? For Tin-rank field rations, I hear they get Ardun meat."</p>
<p>"Really? And... us mudders?" He also lowered his voice to a whisper.</p>
<p>"Trust me, you really don't wanna know."</p>
<p>"Ahhh..." He sighed, his left arm tucked to his waist. We could see his eyebrows shaped like a glisser. He wore a heavy jacket with zips that ends around his chest, and a sweater inside. From behind, we could blurry see a woman with silver hair and silver coat, accompanied by a man, walking towards their direction. The workshop was huge, and there was a huge workshop door that linked to the outside. All we could see was yellow sky. The interior walls looked rusty. The floor were metallic.</p>
<p>"I miss the good old Silver days. Didn't have to rely on rations back then. We had cooks come and serve us right on the front line. Used to get Armu sirloin, we did."</p>
<p>As he spoke, other soldiers, seeing the silver-coat, her silver hair spreaded like waterfall, length to her waist, continued walking with the accompanying guys. Other soldiers bent their arms, palm facing inwards just over their shoulders, held into a fist, legs together and stood straight, stopped whatever they were doing, as she passed. They didn't notice her arrival.</p>
<p>"Seriously?!" Perhaps the nurse-hat guy wasn't from their Silver rank colony before. As the woman stopped, they still hadn't noticed her. A soldier working at the levnis wheel had to signaled at them in a loud whispering tone, "Ah- Hey!"</p>
<p>The buff guy turned to face him, sniped impatiently, "What now?" As he turned, his eyes glanced the silvercoat. "...Urk!" He quickly do the welcoming pose, chest forward. Here, we could see he had yellow irises. He probably felt scared or awkward, being found out complaining of their situations than getting the work done.</p>
<p>The nurse-hat guy only reacted after he did the welcoming pose. He quickly face his direction, gritted his teeth as if biting his tongue, and did the same pose.</p>
<p>The woman, irises mostly turquoise with some magenta, long thick forward-pointing brown eyelashes, wore metal plates at her shoulder, "My own indiscretion... has caused you difficulties. I'm sorry."</p>
<p>The guy standing behind her had brown skin, wore a power suit, thick hair that curved at its edge, and no other features the translator could describe other than strips of orange on his power suit.</p>
<p>The nurse-hat guy anxiously blurted out, "N-no! We would never... Our apologies, Commander Ethel!"</p>
<p>To which the tall guy added immediately, "That was all, uh, just banter! Believe me, we had... no intention of-"</p>
<p>Ethel cut her explanations short, "You enjoyed eating Armu steak, did you?"</p>
<p>The guy relaxed his eyebrows, probably known Ethel for long that she won't punish him for this time, or maybe just recalling, "Uh... Yes, I did! Tastiest food I ever ate!"{{footnote: Ahem, ahem, unconscious reaction to delicious food.}}</p>
<p>"I liked it as well. And I hope we will have it again. So lend me your strength." She scanned the both of them.</p>
<p>The nurse-hat replied, "Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!" And the tall guy nodded.</p>
<p>Ethel maintained her eye contact for a second before turning and walking off, the guy followed closely behind. Their watched her leaving, fist up.</p>
<p>Outside the building, the guy behind Ethel asked, like chatting with an old friend, "I don't see what's wrong with <strong>Volff</strong>, personally."</p>
<p>Ethel facetiously replied, "Pfft. That's because you have poor taste. I'm jealous."</p>
<p>"Well, trade you my taste buds?"</p>
<p>"No, thank you. My mouth'd turn as foul as yours" The path they walked on consist of fine sands and dirt. Those beside the path were more coarse, grass grown sparingly. She stopped at about the end of the route, beyond which are coarse dirt, sand, grass, and some larger stones.</p>
<p>"Hahaha! True that." Where she overlooked was barren. Some taller pillar of rocks lurked at the edge of vision. A bonfire could be seen lit near those rocks.</p>
<p>If we look from the side, to her left, the double-wheel of the Ferronis with cyan tread and inner rim. Where they walked out had been barricaded, and a watchtower located at the entrance. A tent that opened in all direction, like the canteen in Colony 9, was seen inside, but we aren't sure what it hosts. Another watchtower could be seen behind it. We could barely see the plateau in the distance, as the misty dust heavily blurred our vision.</p>
<p>Looking from their front, we could see metal barracks behind them. The guy, with his hands on his waist, scanned the horizon, exclaimed, "They cleared out real fast."</p>
<p>Ethel changed the topic, "I hear the attending Consul... is a particularly punctual sort of character."</p>
<p>The guy complained, "Please not another stickler for the rules..."</p>
<p>"Can't be long now..."</p>
<p>"Yeah... Got about five minutes to go... Whoa!" As if he glanced something to his right, he raised his voice. "Well, well, Consul dear. Your reputation certainly precedes you..." Ethel followed his glance. Some tall irregular plateau stood in the distance. A watchtower was placed at the end of the barricades. There were even some weird plants, like flowers with half-opened petals, with some part of it glowing yellow, growing next to a rock just in front of the watchtower. As the sound revved through the air, a transporting levnis emerged from the dusty air, travelling toward their direction.</p>
<p>Zooming in, there were some short trees, probably just 2-5 meters, growing rarely. Some more of those half-opened petals flowered plants grew.</p>
<p>As the flying levnis made a turn, from where the levnis is currently at{{footnote: Still in the air}}, the Ferronis came fully into view. It had very long claws, each held up by double-wheels with cyan treads (yes, the one we seen left of Ethel earlier.) Two pointed spear-head stuck out to both sides of the rim, and in between, a tombstone-shaped metal with a steering-wheel-like structure at the bottom part. To both sides of the levnis body, we see even more giant wheels, as tall as the levnis body itself, about 2 times taller than the wheels on the claws. The watchtower was about a third of the smaller claw wheels. The levnis seemed to hugged their settlements between its claws. We could also see a tall entrance into the body of the Ferronis from a distance. A bird nest fern like, but colored more like trees in Avatar, grew near a rock where the transporter levnis flew past.</p>
<p>As the transporter reached its landing spots, six legs got stretched out and landed in front of Ethel and the guy.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Sparks' sake, a hover type...?" The guy put his hands over his face, facing his ears at the levnis, eyes closed from the dust. "I mean, did they not get the memo about the terrain here?" {{footnote: How he got to talk amidst the dust was incredulous.}} We could already see soldiers lining up behind Ethel and the guy as the levnis dropped.</p>
<p>As the door opened, Consul K, or rather, Moebius K, strodded down the platform. The others held up their right hand into a fist, the Kevesi welcoming pose. "(coughing)... Ohh, why is it so insufferably dusty around here?" He shook his right hand like how you would pinch a dirty piece of table cloth. "Clearly... the place befits its Dirt-rank status."</p>
<p>Ethel replied, "The rainy season will soon be upon us. I ask your patience, for just this short while."</p>
<p>Putthing his hands on his chin, "Is that so? Then, leaving aside the issue of cleanliness... " He scanned the surrounding with his blood-red-tinted vision, some purple foggy structure were visible, "Just what is with all this fog? I don't take kindly to my vision being obfuscated..."</p>
<p>Perhaps he had given up on complaining, not wanting to stand out in the dust further, asked, "Oh, forget it. So? Where are my quarters?"</p>
<p>"Yes, this way." Ethel lead the way, K followed, and the guy followed behind before the rest of the soldiers.</p>
<hr />
<p>A huge room tiled with wooden planks, along the slanted top were diamond-shaped metal grids with glass windows. Below are the "top beams" of the house, followed by "bottom beams". In between, we could see some displays on one side, with yellow fluorescent light to the other side, just below the windows. A metal plaque with kevesi symbol hung below the bottom beams, below the fluorescent lights. The consul walked below this plaque, sitting down with his hands on the table. An oil lamp could be seen placed on one edge of the table.</p>
<p>Never stopped complaining, "Guh, what a filthy room! How the Dirt rank has fallen..." Scanning the room, we could see some dustbin and two-layer cupboard, with a paper notice stuck in between them. "Ah, I suppose that would be something to take up with the Castle."</p>
<p>Ethel: "Our Ferronis is an old model. I understand your displeasure... but please don't escalate this."</p>
<p>"Do I detect some defiance?" K wasn't happy with things outside his control.</p>
<p>"N-No, no, that was never my-" She furiously tried to explain, shaking her head.</p>
<p>"Relax, girl. I jest. Now then, let's cut the chitchat and talk business." He brought both hands together, his right folded on his left fist. "I'd like you to eradicate some vermin for me." His eyes seemed to be closed, we could not see his iris or anything from the eye opening of the helmet.</p>
<p>"Vermin? By your leave, sir, we've detected no movement from Agnian Ferronises around this area..." She turned to the guy who followed her around, whom nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>K explained himself, "Not Agnus! People. Soldiers. A band of deserters from both sides. Well, something like that."</p>
<p>Ethel was curious, "Agnus and Keves... both?"</p>
<p>As he put his hands on his cheek, "Hah! I think it's best you see for yourself. Hmm? This is expressly at the Queen's behest. Don't foul this up." As he finished, he opened his eyelids, and the moebius icon glowed.</p>
<p>Back at where the Kevesi queen is, the pods still beside. She stood before the giant structure, her "seat," holding her staff. OK. Her seat isn't actually a seat. It is a metal platform, 5 metal "arms" stretches from its center at about equal distance. Two "armrest" like feature stood beside{{footnote: But if those were armrest, even if the queen held out her hand straight, she wouldn't have touch both at once, for her hands can't reach both.}}. Above, we could see a flame clock, the left filled yellow like Agnian, the right glowed blue like Kevesi, touching each other at 12 o'clock. Two of "&lt;" and  "&gt;" each lay at both sides.</p>

<p>Next morning, after they woke up. Lanz, Eunie and Sena were stretching. Riku was helping Manana with folding up her sleeping bag while she watched. Mio was observing Taion by the table. Then, she turned her attention to Noah, whom was checking his iris. On his copper-tinted screen, he was scrolling through some soldier's information. One of them looked like the guy following behind Ethel, another one never saw before.</p>
<p>She walked up to him, prompted, "Looking at something?"</p>
<p>His eyes still focused on his screen, "Oh, nothing in particular, really. It's just kind of a habit. Checking our status, the war... Watching for info updates..." Laughing at himself, "Silly... I don't know why I still bother to check it any more. Not like there'd be updates..." Then, with his iris activated, he turned and meet her eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah" With Mio filling his screen, her outline was glowing orange, to which he never seen before. As he glanced upwards to the top of her head, an orange{{footnote: The color isn't exactly orange, but something like copper orange; but just to make things easy, we'll just say orange without mentioning its shade.}} symbol that resembles Mio's blade came into existence. "What is it?"</p>
<p>"An icon just popped up -- over your head."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She activated her iris to check if she sees the same. Glancing over his head, "Oh yeah. Now I can see an icon for you as well." She saw an orange icon that resembled Noah's blade.</p>
<p>"When did we unlock a feature like this? I've never noticed it before." Evoked by their conversation, others formed a circle with them. Noah turned his head to face Taion and Sena. On Taion's head, a symbol with an "8" outline; on Sena's a hammer. Both were blood red. Switching attention to Lanz and Eunie, Lanz had his broadsword, Eunie her rifle-staff. Both were also blood red.</p>
<p>Glancing back at Mio's, "Yours seems to be... the only one not locked."</p>
<p>He tried clicking on it. Mio wasn't checking on her iris by now. She was galvanized, seeing before her eyes his outer jacket turned into one mirroring hers.</p>
<p>"Huh!" Having shocked, she drew a step backward. Noah scanned his new clothing, "Wha-?" (in a high tone)</p>
<p>Manana and the others weren't less surprised, "Ohoho-"</p>
<p>Eunie: "He's lit up like a sparkin' lightbulb!"</p>
<p>Noah reactivated his iris to check for more information. "I guess there must still... be more to this feature." He tried summoning his blades. Two rings appeared on both his hands, Mio's blade.</p>
<p>Sena exclaimed, "Hey, that's Mimi's!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "What in the blazes...?"</p>
<p>As he closed his eyes, his "soul" was practicing moves with the new blade in the yellow-cloud space, like those he was in when he transformed to Ouroboros the other day. "I've never used this kind of Blade before, but all the techniques I can use with it are flashing before my eyes."</p>
<p>Mio was eager to try, her smooth silver jacket replaced with one flurry dark red. Then, she withdrew Noah's blade. Closing her eyes, she saw what Noah meant. "It's so weird... Not like... we suddenly just gained the knowledge out of the blue. But... as if it were always ingrained deep within us. Strange..."</p>
<p>Sena eyed on Mio while she activated her iris, yet was blood red.  "Aww, doesn't look like I can get Mimi's gear. Now that's a shame..." As she looked, Noah and Mio sheathed their blades.</p>
<p>===</p>
<p>By now, the group were stoked. "Mm... This is?" As she gasped, Eunie's clothing transformed to Taion's, including the orange scarf. Yet, she wasn't satisfied, "How come I got moodyguts's and not Noah's huh?" As she turned and looked at "moodyguts," his jacket changed to hers.</p>
<p>After scanning his new attire, he looked back at her equally curious: "That's what I'd like to know. Your class is the only one I can seem to pick, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Then, Lanz long coat turned into a thin silver ones, with its inside egg-yolk yellow. Sena, before she transformed, also wore one of those; after, Lanz's long coat. They tried summoning their blades, him wielding Sena's hammer, and she carried his broadsword.</p>
<p>Feeling its weight, he exclaimed, "Whoa... You can lug this thing about without a power frame? Not bad!"</p>
<p>As he looked at her, she was scratching her head showered with his praise. She smiled back at him, after which they withdrew their new blades.</p>
<p>Eunie, "Dunno how this is even working, but cool!"</p>
<p>Taion, "But is this all part of Ouroboros, too? If it gives us more options in battle, I'm all for it."</p>
<p>Sena agreed, "Yeah, I wanna take this new Blade out for a spin!"</p>
<p>Mio turned to Noah, asked, "From here, we head due south, right?" He nodded back.</p>
<p>He turned to the others, "Perfect. We can test them out on the road." He activated his iris, and his clothes returned to his; same with Mio.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a test battle, they sheathed their blades. Noah described his experience to Mio, "I felt a lot more nimble there, like the way you usually fight."</p>
<p>She looked at him, excited: "It looked like second-nature to you. It was crazy."</p>
<p>"You should have seen yourself!"</p>
<p>"Hehe, I think I could've thrashed you! With a little more practice..."</p>
<p>Eunie turned to Lanz, her hands behind her head, "Y'know, it's totally bananas... Ouroboros is bonkers powerful."</p>
<p>Lanz was stoked, "Right?"</p>
<p>Sena activated her iris and looked at Mio, seeing something different. While most of the upper part still blood red, orange started to fill the bottom part, like water in partially-filled bottle. "Ah! The gauge for the locked icon has filled right up!"</p>
<p>She reaffirmed after doing the same, "Same here!" Turning to Taion, it's no difference.</p>
<p>Taion drew conclusion, "So, logically, if we gain enough experience by fighting together, we'll become able to use each other's classes.That seems to be it." Then, he changed the topic, "As much as I'd like to experiment... "</p>
<p>Noah read his mind and completed his sentence, "Yeah, I guess we shouldn't stay in one place for too long."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Well, better get ourselves down south!"</p>
<hr />
<p>In a valley, where lights were poor. Taion called for a pause, "Hold it a moment..." As everyone turned and faced him, he continued, "I have a proposal as to our next route."</p>
<p>Mio: "OK. Shoot."</p>
<p>"I'll send you the map data." As they checked their irises, a map with blue dot showed their current location. They were currently at an intersection, with two routes, one to the East, another to the West. "Broadly speaking, it's either east or west. I would suggest we go west." As he finished, he drew a line on the map to visualize.</p>
<p>"Why's that?"</p>
<p>"The area to the west is under Agnus's control. There is a certain degree of risk, as they'll have deployed a number of units... but it's the quickest way to get south."</p>
<p>"What about the east route?" Noah drew a line to the East, prompting for more info.</p>
<p>To which he replied, "No man's land. None of the colonies have laid claim to it as of yet. However, we'd suffer a significant time loss."</p>
<p>Sena: "Time... versus risk."</p>
<p>Lanz was concerned, "Wait a sec. We're gonna stir up the Skeeter nest?"</p>
<p>Taion looked at him, "I only said there was a 'degree' of risk." He tried to drum it up with livelier tone, "Really, it's not so bad."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't convinced, wrapping her arms around her chest "But Agnian troops <em>are</em> deployed there, yeah?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And we're still gonna go?"</p>
<p>"All I said is that it would be more efficient."</p>
<p>"Efficient."{{footnote: One didn't recognize whose voice is this, Mio or Eunie.}}</p>
<p>Sena seconded him: "Well, maybe we do need to be more efficient! Faster is better! We don't wanna be dragging our heels forever... right?"</p>
<p>Mio, with her arms crossed: "Hey! I just have to ask... Are you trying to push some agenda?"</p>
<p>He was pushing his glasses up (again), perhaps gotten caught? "Wha-? No... Certainly not..."</p>
<p>"But you admit the east route is the safer option. That's just strange. Why wouldn't you pick the safe way?" Mio pressed for more.</p>
<p>"Because time is of the-"</p>
<p>She cut him off, "Look. There you go again."</p>
<p>He sighed, continued, "That's not all, though! It's all wasteland to the east. The... the heat! It'll be unbearable!"</p>
<p>Sena agreed, both hands under her cheeks held into a fist and nodding to her, "Er... Yeah, you're gonna melt in the sun!"</p>
<p>Mio shook her head, "I'm fine with your choice. But we need to think about everyone's safety."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Noah, what's your take?"</p>
<p>"Me? Uhh..." Noah was watching their drama, haven't thought about his own decision. The Agnians turned their focus to him and waited. He looked down for a while, reminiscing his chat with Mio's, on her diary, on how she felt happy speaking to him just like that, on her smile. His raised his head, their eyes met. A few moments later, he seconded Mio's decision, "I think... I'd rather take the safe route."</p>
<p>Mio nodded back at him, grasping her hands together, palm on fist, putting it to her chest, thanking him in silence. Sena and Taion's slightly closed their eyes, heads tilted down in disappointment. He did not dismiss their worries. "As for the heat... We can probably figure something out."</p>
<p>Lanz: "There. Four against two."</p>
<p>Taion scoffed. Mio tried to convince the others, "Taion... Sena..." Sena looked towards Taion, he paused. "Please..."</p>
<p>With a sigh, he compromised, "Ngh... Fine, then. If you absolutely insist." Sena nodded back at her.</p>
<p>With a cheerful tone "Then it's settled!" As she walked towards the east route, taking the lead, "C'mon, cheer up guys! We're outta here!" Everyone followed behind. Noah was last to followed, his eyes on hers as she continued, perhaps relieved to had made her day.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note on Environment:</strong> A tall pillar made of irregular rocks stood in the center. Copper-colored birds with wings stretching meters, like the wandering albatross but not really, one rest on the platform, another flew around. We could also see some deer in the distance with green tails. Also smaller animals like "bunnit" (rabbit with the tail of a squirrel). There were lofty platforms to both sides, like a sandy valley. Plants were rare, with only a few grass stucking out here and there. Behind the scene was a tall bridge that joined both platforms at the entrance. Sand could be seen falling down. There were also red short trees, like those saw in Ethel's colony in the distance as we entered the dune. Most sands were brown, but there was a patch of white sand aggregated as well. Irregular pillars of rock stuck out here and there. There was two platform in the distance, like two fingers about to crush the desert. This is <strong>Eagus Wilderness</strong>, of Fornis Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The blaring sun shone on the rocky floor. Flora and fauna were rare: two species, one was the red-leaved low tree we saw when consul K visited Ethel; another with long purple sword-like leaves that spreaded from its center, at about the same angle, making a fan-like structure. The latter shrub grows tall or short. Behind them is a platform which leads to a sandy dune, surrounded by even higher rocks on the other sides. The rocks seemed to be carved out from the center, as it looked to translator like an annihilation event happened and caused the shape. The group were walking <em>really</em> slow, exhausted from the unbearable heat. Sena and Mio were falling far behind, both took off their jackets.{{footnote: The others don't took off their jackets.}}</p>
<p>"Ugggh... So... hot..." Mio's face was blushing red, her steps unstable as she leaned on Sena whom helped her move forward, herself sweltering. "Can't... go... on..." As she finished, she dropped her body weight totally on Sena.</p>
<p>Sena had her hands over her shoulders, "Keep it together now, Mimi! I'll drag you along myself if I have to!"</p>
<p>Lanz overheard their conversation: "I mean, I get that it's hot, but really?"</p>
<p>"Whether we're talking food or weather, Mio does not take to heat." Taion replied, looking back at her, "I knew this would happen." Probably why he preferred the detour earlier.</p>
<p>Noah: "Heat's never bothered you, has it, Lanz?"</p>
<p>Lanz smiled, showing his left arm's biceps, "Nnnope. I'm made of sterner stuff."</p>
<p>Noah took a look at Mio. Her eyes totally closed, ears drooped down. Then, he exclaimed in a lower tone, "Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little worn out. Spot to rest would be nice about now."</p>
<p>Something caught Sena's attention in the distance, "Hey, look! There!" The group turned to her. Mio's head totally bent down as she told her, "Mimi, look! It's water! There's an oasis!"</p>
<p>"Wa...w-water...?" She strenuously carried her head up to look at the distance. With blurry vision, she saw a glimmering spot, lights casting on it. The reflection from the pool was blinding. On the left of the water, there was a taller platform with a cave entrance to its end. On the right before the pool, there was a plant that looked like bird nest fern growing on the floor.</p>
<p>"Yeah, water!"</p>
<p>"Water!!!" Suddenly, she regained all her strengths. Her eyes lit up bright, focused on that pool of water. Her ears stood up straight. She no longer depended on Sena.</p>
<p>"C'mon! Let's go!" Sena encouraged.</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Immediately, she dashed past the group with Sena followed. The group quickly got to the side, leaving a trail for them. Lanz and the others can't believed their eyes.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh, come on. Talk about overreacting."</p>
<p>Taion: "We should be thankful they're back in high spirits." His Mondo was up in the air when they dashed past, and it spiralled back down slowly.</p>
<p>Noah wasn't feeling too hopeful, "Let's just hope it's not a mirage..." They slowly took steps behind those dashing two.</p>
<hr />
<p>Riku and Manana emerged from underwater. Sena was backstroking to float. Mio did some buoyancy breaststroke. "Ahahah! Nice and cool!" Now that she regained strength, she could play a while with the water, splashing up.</p>
<p>Sena: "Thank the Clock..."</p>
<p>"Ooooooooh...ahhh" Eunie had took off her jacket, ran and jumped, hands flung on top with bent knee, diving into the water. She landed in between the four, some water splashed around.</p>
<p>"Aw'right then... My turn!" Lanz took his jacket off, move backwards a few step, preparing for a run.</p>
<p>Noah and Taion turned their attention to him, with the former asking: "You too?"</p>
<p>He stretched his hands to his back and rolled his heads to warmup. "Don't happen every day!" As he finished, he made a run and jumped, "Yeeeeee...ahhhhhh!" He aimed to land at the center of the group.</p>
<p>"Waah?!" Sena and the group were shocked to see a huge shadow coming in their direction. His knees were bent while he soared. As he reached his desired landing point, he flung his arms up and stretched his legs straight, the others watching him slammed into the water as the ripple pushed the girls away from the point of contact. The nopons sink into the water, slowly floating up a moment later, fainted.</p>
<p>Eunie breathed hard as she emerged from underwater, turned to face where Lanz dived immediately, punching the water as she speaks, "You muppet!"</p>
<p>Lanz emerged a moment later, some water sprayed at Mio whom was very near him, which she blocked with her hands. "NEVER do that again!"</p>
<p>Lanz turned to his back, trying to soothe Eunie's anger, "C'mon! You're already soaking wet anyway! What difference does it make?" He swam off, freestyle, into the distance as he finished.</p>
<p>Eunie sniped back, "The difference is, you're an arsehole! What snuffin' difference..." Then, she pat one side of her temple hard, her head rolled in the other direction, "Uggh, I've got water in my ears now...!"</p>
<p>From a higher location, we could see where the Noah and Taion stood at an elevated platform, compared to the oasis bank on the opposite side. As those guys watched the drama, Mio and Sena regrouped, the nopons still fainted floating, and Eunie was trying to catch Lanz. Noah asked, "Staying here, are you?"</p>
<p>He immediately checked his iris, "I've got something to take care of.I'll send it to you now."</p>
<p>Noah checked it. "A map?"</p>
<p>"From a survey branch." There were several locations marked green, some cover huge distance, others puny. "Annihilation events occur frequently here."</p>
<p>Noah deactivated his iris and faced him, "Annihilation events? You mean..."</p>
<p>We were reminded by the two planets approaching each other, a huge blast of energy released, then looking at the animal-like snowy peak, a ball of energy emerged from nowhere and carved it into two as it disappeared later.</p>
<p>Taion nodded back. He turned to look at the opposite direction, "Look." This confirmed translator's guess earlier. (Though, something weird being a rock was floating mid-air, even though it's not an anti-gravity mechanism). {{footnote: There were some machines behind Taion, which is a nopon travelling merchant stall; but that's inexistent if you play the game the first time; only existed if you replay, so we'll emit it.}} Further away, we could see a platform stretched to the right.</p>
<p>"It happens here too." They turned their attention to the Oasis walls, which were also carved out by annihilation event.</p>
<p>"Given our route, we should take the safest way possible." He continued.</p>
<p>"Very cautious of you."</p>
<p>"It's my duty to be." He continued checking his iris.</p>
<p>"Thank you." He patted him on his shoulder, as if giving him the job.</p>
<p>Taion was shocked, turned his attention to him, "Uh... Sure." He saw him walked to the back, taking off his jacket. Then, he ran, jumped, and dived. Another big water splashed up, and we could hear the girls roared in the distance. "Whoa!"</p>

<p>As the night falls, they continued traversing their path, oasis beyond sight limit. Patches of grass now grows on both sides of the path. Gusting winds brought with them dusty sands, tampering one's vision. The destination? Nowhere to be seen. Rocks and detours, all that is. Plants glowed amidst the foggy air, like cat's eyes in the dark. Mio scanned for Noah, him far behind. She stopped and waited for him, walking beside him thereafter.</p>
<p>"Hey! Can I ask you something?" Curiosity lurked in her. "It's special, isn't it? Your Blade, I mean."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes, one part of it... glows. Why's that?"</p>
<p>In a lively, whispering tone: "Ah...! You can tell? That's amazing..."</p>
<p>"It's hard not to."</p>
<p>"Ah, right." There was a moment of silence as she waited.</p>
<p>Then, she asked, in a whispering tone, "Is it a secret?"</p>
<p>"No, I can tell you."</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="start-of-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories">(Start of Memories)</a></h4>
<p>The training ground. Young Noah, wearing a healmet and bullet-proof vest, along with other soldiers, drew his blade, a standard Kevesi sword. Others, with their broadsword or staffs or whatever, were already practicing by themselves, while he still tried to get a hold of it. Soldiers gathered in groups when they practiced; swords slicing the air; square gloves with four "well-shaped" protrudes, glowing cyan punching the air; guns shooting at the static humanoid targets in the gun range; long staff put into the air, ether meteor strikes the ground in front of them as they released, with a small explosion. Still, others practiced against each other.</p>
<p>Noah's group gathered by the fence, Lanz practicing while the others warming up. Eunie summoned and swung her blade like a Kung Fu monk swinging his wooden stick around. Then, pointing her rifle at nowhere, the staff rotates as ether energy got sucked in, releasing in a single shot. As it flew into the distance, Newton's third law took her off balance, jumping single-legged several times before landing on both feet, panting. She reloaded to try again.</p>
<p>His hands stretched out, one palm facing up, another down. A mace-like blade appeared, with a ball of energy glowing brightly at its top. He gripped it with his right hand, pointed it to his front, attempting to summon an attack but ended up drawing a green ring around him. Electric sparkled on the circumference of the ring. He looked at his blade, disappointed, but gritted his teeth, tried and tried, to no avail. With all his might, the ring suddenly glowed brightly; its range increased, but still no signs of damaging ranged arts. As he finished up, he wiped his sweat.</p>
<p>Noah didn't summon a blade; instead, gripped the training blade he had before. It was laid against the fence. He focused his mind, practiced slashing in sync with his breath.</p>
<p>"Noah, my man... Are you still playing around with that little toy?" Garvel approached with his team as they practiced. Eunie and Joran stopped and looked.</p>
<p>The broadsword girl sneered, "Have you considered a Nopon weapon? You might actually get somewhere with that." Noah didn't stop.</p>
<p>"Oi! You deaf or what, Noah?!" Garvel wasn't giving up.</p>
<p>Joran, with trembled voice, "Garvel!? Noah, this is bad..."</p>
<p>"Heh. Not even a peep? Don't need to pay us any attention?"</p>
<p>"Oh please... I wasn't ignoring you. Once I finish this set... we can chat!" Noah sounded as he made a slash that reverberated the air. The shockwave, or perhaps their shock, made them took a step back.</p>
<p>Eunie and Joran wasn't less shocked, Eunie turned into a smirk, as if showing off. Noah waited for a while before breathing out and stood up, turning his attention to Garvel.</p>
<p>"Well? What were you saying?"</p>
<p>"Noah... For dead weight, you're a right snuffing peacock!" As if what he did put him down, or perhaps, he was just jealous of his skills. He ran towards Noah and sliced a set of moves, him dodging them.</p>
<p>"Ugh, you...!" His sword can't beat his agility. "You slippery little mudder!" Several slashes and a thrust later, Noah put his leg on his blade and pressed it to the ground. He was dumbstrucked as Noah put his blade over his neck.</p>
<p>"Well, anything else?" Noah asked patiently.</p>
<p>"You... snuffin' weakling!" He broked away from his legs by slicing his sword upwards, kicking Noah in the chest concurrently. Noah put his hand over the injured spot as Garvel sliced his training sword in half.  Noah fell to the ground, one hand in a knelt position.</p>
<p>"Blast it all!" He punched Noah's face, he landed on his side, groaning in pain. Garvel wasn't satisfied, "Oh, you'll... get it now!", he was about to slice Noah as Lanz blocked his attacks.</p>
<p>A few breath to figure out what happened, he turned to look to his left, exclaimed,</p>
<p>"L-Lanz?!"</p>
<p>"Break it up now. Didn't know you could be so petty, Garvel."</p>
<p>"Peh. Ain't got no time for this musclehead." He bit his words between his teeth and put his sword on his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Wanna say that again?" Lanz was provoked.</p>
<p>"Hmph! We'll settle this properly... In tomorrow's trial!" He sheathed his blade, turned and walked away, shouting to his group along the way. "Move it!" Noah's team watched them off.</p>
<p>"Noah, are you OK?" Joran quickly ran up to his side, still laying on the ground.</p>
<hr />
<p>By a ladder inside the training ground, they were sitting at different heights, with Eunie laying her back against a wall. Lanz turned and faced Noah, "Don't let it get to you. Guys like that are the first ones to snuff it in a real battle."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not worried about him. I really can't call my weapon, though... I worry I'll end up being a burden."</p>
<p>"Never thought that here, not even once."</p>
<p>"Thanks... Kind of you to say."</p>
<p>"It's just the truth!" He watched him stood up and walked away, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>He paused and turned to him "To visit Riku. Since it broke. The trial -- it's tomorrow. I'm gonna need a new weapon for that." The others stood up and followed him through the alleyway.</p>
<hr />
<p>Riku's place, with some cylinders in the background, and rusty floor, or perhaps dirt floor. A silvery sharp blade with a hole where the handle and the blade joined, laid atop two stands, a weapon holder, displayed in the center of the room. The handle was purple in its center, with a snake-liked gold curled around it.</p>
<p>"What's this?" Noah asked.</p>
<p>Riku folded his wings and introduced, "Magic sword, Lucky Seven! In distant past, were seven legendary swordsmithpon. Over course of seven years, forged sword from seven types of steel. No other sword like it in existing."</p>
<p>"Magic?" The kids weren't convinced.</p>
<p>"Lucky Seven?" Lanz questioned.</p>
<p>Riku tried to prove it, "Lanz, please to give good cleave with Blade and split clean in halves."</p>
<p>"Sure 'bout that? Better not pull some, 'You break it, you bought it' sneaky sorta deal..."</p>
<p>Riku opened his eyes wide, reaffirmed "Riku would never dream! Just put all of heft into mighty swing!"</p>
<p>"Weird ask... Err, sure!" He summoned his blade, "You want me to cut it, I'll cut it, I guess." He put his broadsword over his head, "Here it comes!"</p>
<p>A single slice and his broadsword split clean. Riku smiled at the result, while Lanz observed as he sheathed his blade, exclaimed, "Queen's beans! There's not even a nick in it!" The others went up nearer to confirm.</p>
<p>"Friend surprised? Indeed, is most prized of swords. Even armor of Ferronis get sliced to itsy bits!" Noah's eyes couldn't leave Lucky Seven now, but his look, to the translator, was pitying, as if the sword had done something wrong.</p>
<p>He dipped his head, speaking without confidence, "I think... I'll pass." Lanz and Eunie looked at him, shocked.</p>
<p>"Pass?" Riku wasn't sure why. "So, you not have need for?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. It's too strong."</p>
<p>"Hmmmm..." Riku thought for a while, perhaps on how to convince him, asked again, "Noah want Lanz and friends to kick buckets?"</p>
<p>He instantaneously rebutted, "No, what the spark?!"</p>
<p>"Same as letting friends die." He pressed on, now on a heated debate.</p>
<p>"No it's not."</p>
<p>"If friends not fight, cannot survive."</p>
<p>"Sure, but I don't need to use your sword."</p>
<p>"Then, why Noah not call Blade?" The others was confused what he meant.</p>
<p>Noah explained, "It's not out of choice, I just can't..."</p>
<p>Riku cut him off, sharply looking at him, "False! Riku see through like transparent!" Noah drew a step back. He continued, "Noah <em>can</em> call Blade! Just no big desire of fighting spirit!"</p>
<p>"Riku..."</p>
<p>Lanz prompted, "Hey, is he serious?" He sighed, like one whom lost all hopes. Lanz took a step forward, raising his tone "Noah?" A blade appeared before his face. Noah drew out his blade, a standard red Kevesi blade{{footnote: The "red" probably being the only difference, while other designs, like a "startup" button as its joint, is purely cosmetics.}}, then sheathed it. Lanz took a step backward.</p>
<p>"What the... All this time, huh?" he took a step backward, shocked and questioned. Noah looked down, didn't want to look at the others.</p>
<p>Riku continued his lecture, "If death is not option, should live. Only way is fight like life depends. <strong><em>Thinking of self... alone... is way of coward.</em></strong> Though, Riku know feeling well."</p>
<p>"I'm afraid..." He blurted out, tempestuously.</p>
<p>"Of fighting, you mean?" Lanz asked. He shook his head.</p>
<p>"Of this world. It's so brutal and relentless. And I'm afraid of what... we might... become."</p>
<p>"Mate..." Lanz looked at him, concerned.</p>
<p>Riku the mentor cheered him, "Ohoho! Riku knew Noah was hero material!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah wasn't sure what he meant.</p>
<p>Riku looked at Lucky Seven, explained, "It true this sword possess incredible power. Might even rob enemies of many-much lives, yes. But, only those who understand nature of terror have right to wield..." Then, he looked back at Noah, "Eh, quote masterpon of Riku, anyhaps."</p>
<p>"So, if Noah can call Blade now, can still keep Lucky Seven, maybe in some kind of disguise. In different words, can turn it into sheath."</p>
<p>"Sheath...?"</p>
<p>"Can use it in fights like normal. But if ever push come to shove... Time will come when Noah truly need Lucky Seven's strength. Then, is only matter of drawing."</p>
<p>"When I truly need its... strength." His eyes laid on the sword, thinking, but hadn't understood yet.</p>
<p>"Exact," Riku assured, "If Noah never lose sight of that feeling, one day, such time surely come."</p>
<p>He looked back at Riku, "That is, if I can master it..."</p>
<p>"If fail to master, just give back. Can pick out different one!" Riku assured.</p>
<p>"Ah, right..." He seemed convinced.</p>
<p>"Please not to feel specially indebted to Riku -- just take! No need for overthinkings!"</p>
<p>By now, he had cheered up a little, "Hah! OK. I accept your offer. Oh, and... Riku?"</p>
<p>"What is?"</p>
<p>"Mind if I... change the name?"</p>
<p>"Meh?"</p>
<p>He smiled back and scratched his neck, "'Lucky Seven' just isn't doing it for me..."</p>
<p>"Aww...." Riku looked disappointed, with a long sigh.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories">(End of Memories)</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>The group continued their travel, sandy winds still blowing fro their side, and we still can see the two pillars behind them, as if they hadn't traveled any distance all this time Noah was storytelling. Mio curiously asked, "So... what name did you end up picking?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Uh... Name?" He turned to look at the sky, low on emotion.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh!" She teased him, "You don't wanna say? Or what, is it that embarrassing?"</p>
<p>"N-no... It's not embarrassing. That's not it." He looked down at the ground, denying.</p>
<p>Mio giggled, "Haha... I'm getting strong... <em>emotional</em> vibes here."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say 'emotional' per se... Rather..." He looked up into the sky, lost in thoughts, maybe thinking of the correct word to express his feelings, blurted out quickly "something I miss. Yeah." She looked at him for a while, sighed, perhaps didn't see success cheering him up. He then told her, "You know, you're the second one that's noticed this weapon."</p>
<p>"Really? Is that something special?"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"And the first? Who was it?"</p>
<p>"She's incredible," he replied indirectly, "and we... owe her our lives." They finally reached the detour to turn left, after a long walk. Noah and Mio had closed in behind Riku and Manana, and the others.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ethel's colony. Streetlights turned on, but its range was limited by the extremely dusty air. The lights by the platform and ferronis control room displayed red. Soldiers were seen chatting at the platform extending on the same level as the control room's roof. Ethel stood inside the control room, looking out of the glass windows, her Iris glowed blood red.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-10"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-10">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="confronting-ethel-confronting-k-smashing-the-flame-clock"><a class="header" href="#confronting-ethel-confronting-k-smashing-the-flame-clock">Confronting Ethel, Confronting K, Smashing The Flame Clock</a></h1>
<p>Lanz noticed something unusual, something stood out of the bleak environment. He walked towards it, Eunie followed behind. He knelt on one leg and examined the footsteps. "This'll be sketchy."</p>
<p>"Yeah... Agreed."</p>
<p>The rest of the team, noticing their absence, now gathered around them. Manana prompted, "What friends afraid of, hmm?"</p>
<p>Noah: "I'm seeing signs of patrols. Was it Colony 4...?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Colony 4?"</p>
<p>Riku explained, "Colony of badbutt elites, led by commander of great repute. Whole rest of Keves acknowledge their superiority."</p>
<p>Taion: "Are you certain? This is Nih'l Valley!"</p>
<p>Apart from the tall valley wall, there were another layer of lower platform that shrouded where they stood.</p>
<p>Lanz stood up, "Right. Like Riku said."</p>
<p>"But how can this be? How can their zone of control extend this far out...?"</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud noise could be felt afar, the ground trembling with increasing magnitude. Sena first felt its presence, "Huh? Anyone feel that?" That alerted the others.</p>
<p>"A quake?" Mio asked.</p>
<p>Noah was the only one not in defensive posture: "No, it's..." He sensed its source, "Over there!"</p>
<p>Ethel's ferronis's claws appeared from behind a tall stone, its wheels crushing the stone into pieces, any stone, as it rolled on its path. The ferronis, its flame clock a third full, drove and parked at a distance from the group. Levnises and soldiers, appearing from beneath the ferronis, marched towards their location. From its top, blue globules of energy, cannonballs, were fired and landed in front of where the group stood, spitting out flames as it hits the ground.</p>
<p>The group ran for their life, dodging to keep themselves outside the blast radius. Just as they were about to run out of the valley, two cannonballs hit the walls of the valley, sending pebbles falling down, forcing the group to a halt as they watched rocks tumbling down as they turned and ran in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Atop the head of the ferronis, ethel and her bodyguard, standing with their hands behind, watched, shouting at them, "There you are. You monsters." The guy raised his hand, ordered the volleys to stop firing as they waited for the dust to clear. From atop, we can see the rocks that tumbled down closed off the back route, while the ferronis occupied the front route.</p>
<p>"Us, monsters?" Noah couldn't believed his ears.</p>
<p>Then, Eunie pointed towards the top of the ferronis, "Noah, look!"</p>
<p>"That's... Ethel!"</p>
<p>Mio: "You said... Ethel? You mean Silvercoat Ethel?"</p>
<p>Lanz was surprised: "You know about her?"</p>
<p>"Even in Agnus, the name has spread far and wide. Silvercoat Ethel... A veteral soldier unmatched in strength. People would whisper... about how she felled three colonies at once with just a hundred troops!"</p>
<p>Eunie rebutted, "Yeah, but... this is Ethel!" Noah turned his attention back at Ethel, thinking of a solution.</p>
<p>Taion immediately spit out, "We know her name! So?"</p>
<p>"So, she helped us out once before! She was strong, but kind. She could still help." Then, Noah took bold steps out into the open. Eunie saw his move, prompted, "Noah?"</p>
<p>"It might not work, but..."</p>
<p>Taion raised his voice: "Noah!"</p>
<p>"It's all right!" Then, he dashed off by himself towards Ethel's ferronis. Ethel watched his move, but saw him as some abominable monsters enshrouded in thick black smoke with two red eyes glowing in the dark. Noah stopped in front of the ferronis, shouted at her, "Ethel! It's me! Noah, from Colony 9! You know us, you saved us back in Colony 14! You praised my Blade... You must remember!"</p>
<p>Ethel: "You say I helped you... in Colony 14?"</p>
<p>"You did!"</p>
<p>"Really?" She closed her eyes for a second, reopened them, trying to peer through the dark clouds but failed. "I've no recollection of helping, you!" Cannonballs with its trajectory targeting Noah flew as she spoke her last word. Noah ran just before flames engulfed where he stood, Lanz quickly stood out from behind the obstacle and stretched his hand out. As he caught Noah, he slung him behind the obstacle and blocked the attacks.{{footnote: It's not on screen, one just assume this is what he did as he did not hide just before a volley was about to hit him.}} The cannonball landed so close, sending dust into the air, almost dislodging the group's balance.</p>
<p>"This is far from 'all right'!" Taion complained as they gathered around him, whom was sitting on the ground.</p>
<p>Mio: "It's pointless..."</p>
<p>"Sorry. I thought I could convince her. Should've known it wouldn't work."</p>
<p>Volleys blasting every inch of the ground in front of them like they costed nothing. The bodyguard again ordered for a stop as dust obscured their views.</p>
<p>Ethel: "Taking cover? Bad move." As her red iris glowed even brighter, she gained red-tinted X-ray vision that filtered out every obstacle, revealing the group's current location.</p>
<p>"Very well done, Ethel." Sitting in his quarters (presumably inside the ferronis), K was satisfied. He had borrowed his X-ray vision to Ethel, eyelids closed as the moebius sign glowed in his right eye. "I do so love your loyalty. Now, the enemy is before you. Chase them to the ends of the world. Not a single one of them can escape."</p>
<p>The bodyguard then ordered the levnises and soldiers to advance into the dusty air.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lanz knocked out a soldier with the back of his handle, assuring himself, "Ngh! Yep, just keem 'em coming, no problem!"</p>
<p>Noah faced the opposite direction, looked into the night sky as brightly-lit balls fell from the sky at them. They quickly escaped their current position.</p>
<p>Riku: "Risky business!"</p>
<p>Eunie looked up while she ran, "Doesn't help that their cannons are way too accurate!"</p>
<p>Mio: "They shouldn't be able to see us from over there." The head of the ferronis wasn't visible from their hiding place, and they assumed vice versa.</p>
<p>"How they know location of Manana and friends?!"</p>
<p>As they passed some narrower part of the valley, Taion looked up into the sky, reminded, "The Iris."</p>
<p>"Meh?"</p>
<p>"Her red Iris is doing this. It's relaying our exact position to her troops!"</p>
<p>"Snuff this..." Lanz put one hand on his back and another on the back of his head as he trodded backwards, as if pulled by gravity than his own muscles.</p>
<p>Eunie shouted, "Lanz! 6 o'clock!"</p>
<p>"Spark!" He complained as he summoned his blade, squads of soldiers approaching from a distance.</p>
<p>"Again!?" More volleys caught Noah's eyes. Lanz and Taion raised the shields as it barraged in front of them. One of the blast devoured the soldiers that was just about to approach them, leaving husks behind.</p>
<p>Taion was surprised, "The soldiers!"</p>
<p>"Their whole squad?! Those heartless mudders..." Lanz was ruffled.</p>
<p>Noah: "Guys, pull back to the cave!"</p>
<p>Sena: "What cave?"</p>
<p>He looked behind, a cave entrance at a distance. "We're sitting Bunnits out here. In there, we can take cover from the volleys."</p>
<p>Lanz: "And after that?"</p>
<p>"Think about that later."</p>
<p>"No Plan B?"</p>
<p>"I didn't have time!" He lead the way and took for a run while the others followed.</p>
<p>K watched with both his eyelids opened. "You can't run from me, brats." He closed his eyelids and the moebius sign appeared again, playfully announced "I've got my eye on you!"</p>
<p>His x-ray vision was focusing on the group as purple fog disturbed his vision, rendering them unstable.</p>
<p>"Black fog...?" As the group continued running, Taion held his step. All the time he planned to not let the annihilation events determining their lives, and here they were.</p>
<p>K wasn't amused either, "Ugh, really? Suddenly fog? Heh! Ah, no big deal. It'll hardly slow me down. I still have eyes on the prize." With stuttering interruption, we could see Taion falling far behind, trying to catch up with the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the cave outlandishly bright (given there were no glowing light source at their location), Taion was lost in thought, analyzing the situation.</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Lanz seethed. As he saw Taion thinking, prompted: "Hey, Taion! Have you been hit?"{{footnote: Translator wasn't sure how one could associate a thinking pose to "being hit", but oh well...}}</p>
<p>"No..."</p>
<p>"Then what?"</p>
<p>"The enemy's acting strangely. Something's off."</p>
<p>Mio: "Off how?"</p>
<p>"Even when we engage, the other soldiers don't provide backup. It's like none of them have been given orders."</p>
<p>Eunie, from behind him, "You're overthinkin' it."</p>
<p>"I thought I was, at first..." Then, he turned to get someone to perhaps second him, perhaps noticed the same thing as he did "Hey, Noah!"</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Yeah. I agree with Taion. They did seem kind of slow to respond."</p>
<p>Noah's words probably triggered something "Oh, no." He looked back towards the entrance. We could see the cave wall about 5 meters above them, with what seemingly looked like scratches.</p>
<hr />
<p>There was an oasis below the elevated platform at the end of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Noah: "We can get down from the left side. With any luck, we can lead them the wrong way. (gasp)"</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ground was shaking. The ferronis parked itself to their right. Ethel jumped down from the head of the ferronis and landed in front of them.{{footnote: God knows how she did that without breaking her legs.}}</p>
<p>Eunie: "Ethel!"</p>
<p>"So unfortunate." As Ethel spoke, soldiers and levnises emerged from the tunnel and cut off their retreat route.</p>
<p>Taion: "Huh! She read us like a book!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Ethel! Do you really not recognize us at all?!"</p>
<p>"Disgusting..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"The sight of you <em>things</em> speaking the words of man... It makes my skin crawl!" She summoned her blades, prepared to fight.</p>
<p>"Ugh... We'll never get through..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Come off it! Just what the spark does she see us as, Gogols{{footnote: Gogols are a gorilla-like monster in the game}}?"</p>
<p>Eunie drew her blade, "She's right there. Why don't you ask her?"</p>
<p>"Like we'll get a straight answer!" Her eyes now glowed bright orange, like someone stuffing the sun into her eyes.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of her blade dug into the ground as she slid backward. She looked up, jumped into the air, and sliced, releasing a sword wave into the air, which Lanz blocked. The group now had their backs on the ferronis. Yet, the shockwave released was so strong a plateau in front of the ferronis came crashing down.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ugh! She's way too good!" He resummoned his blade, knocked out by her sword wave earlier.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well, I guess we don't call her Silvercoat Ethel for nothing, eh?!"</p>
<p>"Tight pinch keeps getting tighter!!!" Manana exclaimed.</p>
<p>"Mimi?"</p>
<p>"Understood." She then looked at Noah, asked, "Ready?"</p>
<p>Noah refused: "We can't."</p>
<p>"But... why not?"</p>
<p>"It's too powerful. We could just wind up killing her." Ethel strode nearer before stopping by a distance.</p>
<p>"Yes, but..." Ethel's approach cut her before she could finish.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her red iris seemed disturbed. She dropped both her blades as she covered it with both hands, crying in pain.</p>
<p>Noah: "What happened? She just stopped...?"</p>
<p>As she glanced at them with her other eye, the abominable monsters she saw so far was no longer stable. The actual form of the group appeared before her eyes in flashes, though insufficient for her to recognize: "Whh-what's... What am I... fighting against here...?"</p>
<p>Noah saw the chance, withdrew his blade, "Maybe now..." Then, he shouted out to her, "Ethel! It's me! It's Noah!"</p>
<p>"Did... you say... Noah...?"</p>
<p>He took a step forward. "Ethel!" It's not just the voice, but K had filtered the speech she heard. Meanwhile, K's moebius iris glowed stronger, trying to regain control.</p>
<p>"Oh, if needs must." He no longer sit behind the scene, teleported from his room. Seeing Ethel falling onto the ground, Noah tried to ran towards her as a purple electrical barrage fell from above, one foot in front of him. He evaded by taking 3 steps backwards.</p>
<p>K teleported in front of Ethel. She looked up, "C...Consul..."</p>
<p>"Really. This is why I can't stand fog." He shook his hands of the surrounding air. "And we were just getting to the good part..."</p>
<p>Noah's blade resummoned, now vibrating tempestuously.</p>
<p>"C-Consul... I... I'm... What... What am I...?" She looked up at him, trying to get an answer; but faced the ground as she got more confused.</p>
<p>K sniped back, "Silence! You were pathetic!" A new purple electrical barrage hit her as she groaned in pain, fainted thereafter. K walked away from her, towards the group.</p>
<p>"Ethel!!!"</p>
<p>"Heh. I suppose it's more fun this way." He get into a boxing stance, untransformed, mischeviously, "Well...? Don't you agree? It's the big bad boss. Boo!"</p>
<hr />
<p>K was knocked back, panting as he was dragged along the floor.</p>
<p>"Did we do it?" Eunie was panting as well.</p>
<p>Noah: "Wait! Something's wrong."</p>
<p>As he stood up, purple electrical current illuminates his vicinity. The electricity, now turned pinkish, grew into a dome-shape in front of the group. As it rotates, purple-pink particles from the surrounding enters his body as he transformed.</p>
<p>Taion: "The light's being drawn in..."</p>
<p>Sena: "The same as when Noah and Mimi...?" After which they gasped.</p>
<p>Mio: "He transformed... He looks exactly like that other one...!{{footnote: The latter sentence, translator actually can't recognize who spoke it, but associated it with Mio as the female voice doesn't sound like any others either.}}"</p>
<p>Well, not exactly <em>the same</em>. The one before had sharp (canines) teeth, this had flat teeth (molars). His right iris glowing red with the moebius symbol. He had a fin-like structure on his chin. His head had a fan-like very thick structure, like that of a bull. He had very strong muscles, a single moebius core{{footnote: This was the double-ring with an infinity sign in the middle, transparent purple}} attached to his chest (the last one got two, if you remember), and "leaf-like veins" on his hips and the under of back of his arm. A hula-hoop ring encircled his waist, floating.</p>
<p>"That Iris... So he was the one controlling the troops?!" Taion noticed.</p>
<p>Noah: "Moebius..." His blade's fluttered at an even higher frequency, emitting a higher pitch sound, the ouroboros sign could be seen on the ring that joined the blade and the handle.</p>
<p>Lanz: "But he's looking pretty hurt... Come on!"</p>
<p>"Waaaaaaa!" K opened his arms wide, "lives" were drawn in both from the battlefield and from the flame clock. The "lives" from the flame clock was "filtered" into green than red before entering him.</p>
<p>"Wha...?!" Lanz was shocked. The holes in his body illuminates green as it disappeared.</p>
<p>Eunie: "His wounds... They look like they're healing!"</p>
<p>Soldiers standing around, not joining the fights, were unable to lock their "lives". They collapsed as "lives" were sucked out of them forcibly. Levnises fell to the ground as the "liveless" soldiers lose control of it.</p>
<p>Lanz and Sena were running towards K as he was healing. K put his arms over his chest, like how boxing players protected their face, deflecting their attacks. As he landed on the ground, he looked back, "Any good?!"</p>
<p>His face emerged from behind his arms, moebius ring glowing. The flame clock, seemingly one-fifth filled, more 'lives' were drawn from. More soldiers fell onto the ground. Taion scanned his vicinity, "He did it again!" Then, looking at the flame clock, "No way... He's stealing from the Clocks?!"</p>
<p>Noah gasped as K laughed, "Hahahahahah! My dear boy... Your vaunted intuition... is shit!!!" A purple ball of energy wrapped around his right fist as he punched in on to the floor, sending shockwaves that threw the crew flying backwards. Ether bullets and Monds were fired before they fell to the ground. He didn't care about blocking, in a "meh" shrug posture.{{footnote: Unfortunately, one can't describe this better than this emoji: <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code>.}}</p>
<p>K continued, "I'm not <em>'stealing'</em> from them. I, as Moebius, have the right to do with the Flame Clocks as I please." Mio and Lanz were launching their attacks on his backs.</p>
<p>He continued to draw more 'lives' from the Flame Clock, now one-tenth of its full gauge, and more soldiers fell to the ground. "You may hurt me as much as your hearts desire... But where there is life and vitality... I'm afraid I... shall... not... fall."</p>
<p>The holes on his body were glowing with green particles. They dissipated as he bent and put his index finger on Noah's blade, dragging it as it injured him, then healed almost immediately after. Noah watched his performance in front of his eyes, gritting his teeth but not daring to attack.</p>
<p>"Come now. Whyyy don't you give it your best shot..." Then, he stood up, dancing, "and <strong>HAVE AT ME!!!</strong>" As he turned his body to face Lanz, walked a few steps, and turned his face backwards, directing his speech at Noah, "Hahahaha... If you think you can!"</p>
<p>Noah saw that Ethel was wriggling on the floor as life was sucked out of her. Then, he shouted at the others, "Stop attacking! Eunie! Lanz!"</p>
<p>Lanz didn't obey his commands, slicing K on his legs as he replied, "You must be sparkin' joking!"</p>
<p>Eunie jumped on his shoulders and stuck her rifle in between his muscles (which have holes, for some design reasons), firing shots as she replied, "If we let up now, he'll take <em>us</em> down!"</p>
<p>"But... our friends from Colony 4...!"</p>
<p>The moebius punched the floor in front of him, sending rocks and smoke tumbling in a ripple. Giant rocks were sent his ways, which he didn't react. A group of mondos knocked him outside the affected region, a rock landing in front of him as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Taion: "Wake up, Noah! They're not your friends any more. They're his fuel!"</p>
<p>"Even so...!" He stood up, Mio ran to his left.</p>
<p>"Haaaaahahahahahah!{{footnote: The first "haaaaa", if you were to imitate, you should laugh it in one go until your lungs deflated more flat than they usually does in normal breathing.}} These soldiers will nourish me like Glitter Radishes in season, and we can always grow plenty more!" He made dancing moves, treading his way with his backs facing them as he continued, "If I need a little extra, I can pluck them whenever I want!"</p>
<p>Noah was floundered, "He's killing more of our friends... the more we hit him! There has got to be a way..." Then, as he thought, he looked up, reminded by the Flame Clock, "What if we... But then..."</p>
<p>Mio urged, "What? Did you think of something? (pause) Come on!"</p>
<p>"The Flame Clock... What if we smashed it?"</p>
<p>"You what? How should I know something li-{{footnote: "li-" is "like" in full.}}... Do you mean..." Mio get what he was trying to convey.</p>
<p>The Moebius, glowed in purple, now floated up to the front of the Flame Clock. Noah continued to doubt, "But... What if we just end up killing everybody...?"</p>
<p>Both Noah and Mio were now half-knelt (with one leg) on the ground. Mio tried to convince him to try it out, "If we keep fighting like this... we're all dead."</p>
<p>"Rock and a hard place, huh..." Risk the Colony 4 soldiers dying, or risk them all dying.</p>
<p>The ferronis's wheel moved as it reversed.</p>
<p>"Whatever life is lost... I won't let you shoulder it all alone!" She looked at the direction of the ferronis with intensity.</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>Above the ferronis, there stood 3 pillars aligning about parallel to each other. Electricity were released from all 3 pillars, centering on the center pillar, which a globule of purple energy ball aggregated. K was still floating below the head and the flame clock of the ferronis, about the height of the ferronis's 'chest'.</p>
<p>"Hah. I think it's about time we entered the final act!" The ferronis stood up on both legs, both legs had their ankles bent in front. He raised his right index finger, and the purple electric shot out a beam barrage on the ground in front of it, slicing the floor, sending mud flying off on both sides. Noah and Mio rolled towards their left as the beam sliced through their former position. As the beam were dragged about, it sliced not only the floor, leaving flames burning out of the 'hell hole' but sliced through the valley wall behind it before the rest of the beam blasted into the distance.</p>
<p>This was enough to tip his judgment. "All right... We'll try it!" Mio nodded back. Then, he turned and shouted, "Lanz!"</p>
<p>"What's up?" The group were on the other side of the flames, behind covers. Taion and Eunie were together, Sena in front of them while Lanz beside them on another rock.</p>
<p>"Draw his attention for me!"</p>
<p>"And then what?"</p>
<p>"I'll get in close... and destroy the Flame Clock!"</p>
<p>"Wha- But... If you do that..."</p>
<p>Noah and Mio looked at him sternly and obstinately, "We've got to. It's the only way. On my head be it!"</p>
<p>Lanz was shocked by their unshakeable decision. "(gasp) The spark are you on about? I'm not gonna let you take the fall alone!"</p>
<p>Noah and Mio eyed on Lanz as he analyzed the situation. K was ready for another beam barrage, his right hands held up in a readied position. "Nngh, snuff it. Fine! Have it your way. Get going! Eunie!"</p>
<p>"Cover fire? Leave it to me!"</p>
<p>"Taion! Sena! We need you too!"</p>
<p>Taion was shocked and confused for an instruction from a dumb head, "Huh?" Then, he laughed and smiled back, "Understood!"</p>
<p>"Just say when, guys!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Thanks, everyone... I'll count down from three!" Noah moved to the other side of their hiding place, counting, "Three... Two... One...!" The group stood up as they got ready. As he dashed, he shouted, "Let's go!"</p>
<p>From K's blood-red tinted vision, we can see they were separated into groups of 2 from 3 different direction. "Heh. I know what you're thinking. However..."</p>
<p>The ball rose up high into the air, firing in multiple directions. "If I keep on firing potshots... I'm bound to hit one of you sooner or later." The electrical beam barraged the ground at random. "Preferably <strong>SOONER</strong>!"</p>
<p>As Noah dashed, one of the beams exploded very near him, toppling him as he screamed unconsciously. Running in front of him, Mio turned her attention as another beam hit behind her, sending her towards Noah.</p>
<p>Lanz, back to back with Sena, saw their situation, "Oh crap!" They quickly dashed towards them. Noah on his feet, jumped towards Mio as he saw her fall, held his hands out to reach for her.</p>
<p>"Noaaaah!!!" "Mimi!!!!" As they held their hands out in sync, their will to protect had reached its threshold. A blue dim light illuminated their body surface, and swirling blue strips engulfed their flesh, reappearing in the yellow-smoke space.</p>
<p>Lanz, still floating in the air with hands held out position, Sena's memory floated around him. He quickly regained his step on the ground. Sena was no different with Lanz's memory instead. Their iris glowed with the ouroboros ring as they watched the shared memory fragments. Lanz, realizing what happened, smiled as yellow swirling bands swirled and engulfed them, turning them into circle core, which collided together and formed the ouroboros core. Outside, the ouroboros core reappeared as they transformed.</p>
<p>This was a purple cone-shaped head monster, with two string-shaped structure curled around their back, it's sword-like tip pointed to the front. There was a hula-hoop ring by their neck. Two spikes protruded from their back up, as if you sheathed two spears on both side of your shoulder with its tip pointing up. There are two bright eyes that replaced the temple, and similar half-eye that replaced his ears. Two shields were located at the back of their arms. It's leg 'wore' a high heeled.{{footnote: Meaning, as if it was wearing a high heel shoes; but it's an integrated one, not an external 'shoes'.}}</p>
<p>Just before the electrical barrage landed, he extended a purple frequency shield as his back faced. He was above Noah and Mio, the frequency shield created a dome that prevented multiple strikes from landing on the ground. Eunie and Taion looked from afar.</p>
<p>As the electrical barrage dissipated, Lanz's ouroboros {{footnote: From now on, we'll name the Ouroboros based on who was controlling the ouroboros. With hindsight bias to look into the future, we would know there were 6 forms of ouroboros altogether, corresponds to our 6 protagonists, so you won't get confused.}} landed in front of them, Noah prompted: "Lanz... That form... You mean..." He released Mio as she got up on her feet.</p>
<p>Sena didn't like to be forgotten, "Hey, I'm here too!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Sena as well? So then..."</p>
<p>K didn't give them time, was happy they gathered together than splitted out, "Well, lookee here... Fooound you." He threw a beam at them, which Lanz's ouroboros blocked, both hands over his head.</p>
<p>Lanz: "That mudder..."</p>
<p>Taion spreaded out his Mondo, Eunie stuck her staff onto the ground; their combination created a huge healing ring that rejuvenated the Ouroboros (and Mio and Noah, they were probably injured).</p>
<p>Sena warned, "Lanz! We can't keep this up!"</p>
<p>"Gotta... stick it out..." Lanz persisted. Eunie and Taion struggling to heal them, while Mio blocked her face from the brightness of the beam. "(disappointed grunt) Was that it?"</p>
<p>K: "All right. Now for the coup de grâce." He gathered an even larger ball of energy, so large it's almost as large as the head of the ferronis, and certainly larger than his transformed form. With both hands on top of his head, "Get a load of this!" This launch broke his defense, sending Mio and Noah flying off as Lanz's ouroboros got hit in the center of the beam.</p>
<p>Eunie looked up into the air, her eyes closed, shouted, "Noah! Lanz!" A blue glow along the surface of her body responded to her desire to protect, and was brought into the yellow-cloud space.</p>
<p>She opened her eyes as sounds from Taion's memory fragments interrupted her. She looked around to see his history. Taion was in a posture as if he's about to fall, a shocking face as he absorbs Eunie's memory fragments.</p>
<p>The yellow ring devoured them as they turned into the a circle core, collided and formed the ouroboros core. In the outside world, the healing ring exploded and formed a dome, sending a shockwave was sent into the distance, replenishing her teammates. The other four was glowing bright green as they got up from the ground.</p>
<p>Noah looked at his hands, "My wounds..."</p>
<p>Lanz's ouroboros also looked at his hands, "They're already gone."</p>
<p>As the dust thinned out, a thin ouroboros with two wings on her head, two broadsord-like structure floating on both sides; two pairs butterfly-wing like structure stuck out at the back of both her feet, one pair on each side; and two eye-like structure on her temple/ears, appeared. There was a hula-hoop ring, it's circumference attached to her back, 'pointing' slightly upwards{{footnote: Maybe 20° or so.}}, with two spike-like structure at slightly less than halfway through the ring.{{footnote: Imagine a straight rope with spikes on both ends, folded into a circle; the extra that overlaps will be on both sides of the ring, the point of overlap attached to her back.}}</p>
<p>Looking at herself, Eunie exclaimed, "Did I... Uh... I did this?!"</p>
<p>Lanz's ouroboros: "Whoa..."</p>
<p>Taion sounded, "There's time for that later!"</p>
<p>Eunie was reminded, "Ah, right!" Then, looked at Noah and Mio, "Noah! Mio! Now's our chance!"</p>
<p>"Yeah!"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, K couldn't see anything, now that the black fog grew thicker, "Wha... The fog?!" He complained while tilting his head left to right in search for the team, "This is absurd! Can't see a damn thing... Ugggh!!! Where are they?! Where?"</p>
<p>On his UI, wherever he scanned, he could only see fog. "Where have they gone? I can't see... Can't see anything!" He covered both of his eyes with his hands.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lanz's ouroboros had got behind, launched himself high up into the air as he shouted at K, "Hey, mudder... Catch!"</p>
<p>He punched on K, sending him flying towards the floor before K could react. While he was flying,{{footnote: which seemed to take somewhat too long for the distance between his original position and the floor and his flying velocity}}, he didn't stop complaining, "Why you little... When did you get the jump on me? Well, in that case..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, Eunie's ouroboros appeared in front of him, "Now you decide to open your eyes? Bad sparking shout!" She caught his arms and give him extra force to reach the ground quicker. Her blades on both sides opened up like the wings of a butterfly. He crashed on the ground, sending dirt flying up but didn't create a crater.</p>
<p>As he struggled to stood up, "I... can't heal...!"</p>
<p>"Now, ain't that a snuffin' shame?!" While he was "three" on the ground, one hand on one of his bent leg, Lanz's ouroboros punched him on to the ground just as he was about to stand up, like a police pressing the criminal face onto the floor. He shouted out, "Go now! Do it!!!!"</p>
<p>Noah's ouroboros flew up straight at the Flame Clock, the sword from his back now held on his right arm, "Mio!"</p>
<p>"Yeah!"</p>
<p>Swords against Flame Clock, didn't even create a dent. As the sword got deflected, Noah can't believed his eyes, "Huh?! What the?! Did that not do it?!"</p>
<p>Mio: "How is it so strong?"</p>
<p>"Then... we'll try!" Lanz's and Eunie's Ouroboros, side by side, smashed at it full force, no change in shape. They slowly floated back on to the ground, like feathers.</p>
<p>Lanz: "No use... Bloody embers..."</p>
<p>K on his feet, danced{{footnote: God knows how he had been beaten so badly and still didn't forgot the dance.}}, embraced the ground, "Haaaaaaa.... Haaaa.. Haaa...! Oh, the futility! The Flame Clock... is life itself. One might say, a coalescence of the will to live. I very much doubt it's going to break <em>THAT</em> easily now, is it?"</p>
<p>As they dropped to the ground, Eunie's Ouroboros tucked her butterfly wings back.</p>
<p>Noah{{footnote: Or was it Lanz, translator can't recognize the exact tone, though the Ouroboros in the picture looked like Noah's to one's eyes.}}, disappointed: "Sparks... We almost had it, too..."</p>
<p>"Hah. A fool's errand indeed." Purple mist{{footnote: Moebius's energy.}} evaporated around him. The Flame Clock sent beams of green to heal his wounds, as he joyfully continued, "But you now, I appreciate what you've done. For bringing your lovely selves... <strong><em>SO. CLOSE. UP</em></strong>. Because now I can look upon you..." with his index finger pointed on his right iris, "<em>in all. your. radiance.</em>"</p>
<p>"Wahahahah" Arms embracing the air, he regained control of the beam barrage.</p>
<p>"M-meeeeeh..." Suddenly, Manana sounded from the side, with very short stones encircled them. "Lightning... s-so frightening!"</p>
<p>Riku tried patting on her, "I-it all be OK... Noah and friends will set things right!" Riku turned to meet his eyes with Noah, to remind him what he had bestowed with him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Even armor of Ferronis get sliced to itsy bits!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's the last piece of the puzzle he needed. Looking at the Ouroboros's blade, "If it can really take a Ferronis clean out... then maybe...!" Let's enjoy two second of silence.</p>
<p>"Mio! Try again! Cancel the Interlink after we jump!"</p>
<p>"What's the plan?"</p>
<p>"Looks like the time's come!"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about...?" Her eyes widened, only to realize the story from earlier, "Fine then. Ready when you are!"</p>
<p>They jumped back up at the Flame Clock with Lanz surprised, "Noah! What are you-"</p>
<p>They arrived in front of K, kicked him towards the ground and used him as a stepping stone to get higher up, even higher than the energy ball on top of the ferronis. Mio and Noah, separated at the top of the crescendo, with K watching as he fell backwards, "Y-your Interlink... <em>But why?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah held the sword scabbard with his left, the handle with his right. As the blue circle light on the sword ring faded, he shattered the scabbard withdrewing Lucky Seven; the pieces recombined into a red glove gauntlet, wrapped around his left arm.</p>
<p>Turning his head to his left, Mio's eyes met his, nodded at him as they flew closer to each other, grabbed each other's hand as they were within reach, then put their hands behind each other's chest, even closer together. As their dives came to an end, he raised Lucky Seven up high, gently pierced it into the as-hard-as-tofu Flame Clock, gritting his teeth, "<strong>HUUUUUURRRRRRRAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Every inch they cut, 'lives' escaped the container, until it was in half, and Noah and Mio, his sword now withdrew from the Ferronis, free falling back to the ground. The container lost its purpose, blood spilled like water fountains from its wound.</p>
<p>K, still on his way to the ground "Im...impossible!" He held out his hands, trying to reach for the Flame Clock, moaned "The Flame Clocks cannot be broken! What is this?! <em>Who. are. these. people.?!</em>" He noticed Lanz's ouroboros appeared below the blood fountain, but that's not the point of attention.</p>
<p>'Lives' swiftly showered the ground, seemed not to enter the fallen soldiers yet, to the translator. K looked at his body, "Waaaa... The Flame Clock's power, utterly lost... No..." The purple glow on his skin diminished, leaving the dark purple flesh. "But hooow?!"</p>
<p>The Ferronis couldn't maintain standing, crashed on one side on the floor.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Lanz and Mio had landed on top of Lanz's ouroboros. Noah had sheathed the Lucky Seven back into its sheathed. He asked, "How's Ethel? Everyone OK?"</p>
<p>Then, he and Mio stood up as Lanz's ouroboros touched down, jumping onto the floor. Eunie and Taion had cancelled their interlink, with Eunie replying, "She's gonna be fine."</p>
<p>Taion added, "Seems she only lost consciousness." They were facing K, who wasn't awake from the shock.</p>
<p>"Right... That's good." Mio was scanning Lanz's ouroboros for a while, as he turned and saw Noah took a few steps forward, pointing his sword at K, whom had one-foot-knelt on the ground. "Which leaves..." Lanz also cancelled the interlink now.</p>
<p>Eunie finished his sentence, "Someone who deserves a real thrashin'!"</p>
<p>Lanz walked up as he and Sena summoned their blades, joining the others, "Playing with our lives like they're nothing... You're dead meat!"</p>
<p>K had just stood up and faced them.</p>
<hr />
<p>"No... Nooooo!" Black smoke were escaping from a fatal wound in his chest, which he pressed against with his right hand. He held his left hand and head up onto the sky, asked, "But... why?! How could I have failed?! I just... wanted to play around a little more!{{footnote: Yeah, your dance, yeah.}} Nooo... I don't want to diiiiieeee!!" He couldn't suppressed the black smoke anymore, escaping from his body like a fountain spitting water.</p>
<p>Noah was panting as he considered K's legacy. Certain that he fell forever, they sheathed their blades. It transformed back to humanoid form. They walked up to him.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Just playin' around, was he? Let's take a look at this ugly mudder's face."</p>
<p>"Yeah." Lanz agreed, knelt down beside his corpse as he tried to remove his helmet. "Stuck tight. How d'you get this thing off?" He found the button to release, a click sounded. "Ah!"</p>
<p>As the helmet evaporated off with a red glow, we saw an old man's face with wrinkles, short hair combed back into a fashion with applied gel, pointed ears with earrings, huge nose, thick brows, eyes wide opened grasping for more lives, mouth opened too, triangular chin, slicked-back dark hair. "(gasp) This guy..."</p>
<p>Taion: "He's so different from us... Is this what Consuls look like?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "All wrinkled... Just like Guernica. Is this what aging's like?" She turned and asked Noah.</p>
<p>To which he replied, "I dunno."</p>
<p>Ethel, awaken, slowly got off the ground. Noah saw her standing up. As her vision returned, she had a clear look at the group. The others were alerted by her awakening and turned to her, as she recalled Noah's face, "Ah... It's you..."</p>
<hr />
<p>After Noah told her the whole story, she replied "I see. I'm so sorry. All I remember is that I was fighting against some abhorrent creatures... And you tell me it was you..." Then, she turned towards K, blue moats started to float out of his remains as she walked towards him.</p>
<p>Taking a clear look at his face, "So this is the Consul... This is how he really looks." Then, he evaporated into lights.</p>
<p>Eunie exclaimed, "He's fading... Just like during a Homecoming..."</p>
<p>As Noah looked at his moat, it seemed to brushed through him, hearing the remainder of his wish, "<em>Nooo... I don't want to diiiieeee!!!</em>" Noah's eyes lit up, wide opened. He looked up at the moat, seemingly realized something, and made his decision.</p>
<p>As he took out his flute from his back pocket, Lanz pugnaciously reprimanded, "Nope, no way. You're not sending him on. You realize how messed up that is?"</p>
<p>"Huh? You think so?" He lowered his flute as others focused on him.</p>
<p>"How do you not... Think about the things this guy did!"</p>
<p>Taion agreed and added, "He tried to kill us all, and rob the soldiers of their remaining life!"</p>
<p>"You're right. Both of you are right." Then, he turned to her and asked, "And Mio?"</p>
<p>Mio got awestruck for a second before replying, "Honestly..." She looked down to not face him, "I'm not... sure I would."</p>
<p>"OK..." He respected her beliefs. There was a moment of silence as he looked at the floating particles. Then, he made up his mind to go forward, with Lanz admonishingly cut him off, once again, "Oh, well just do it anyway!"{{footnote: This is spoke in an opposite tone, to mean the opposite of what you had spoken.}}</p>
<p>He put his flute down again as he shared his feelings, "Just now... I felt his essence... brush past me. It felt just the same as ours." Then, he lifted the flute back to levelled with his lips, "So... I feel I have to do this, y'know?"</p>
<p>Mio, looking at him, recalled,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's memories:</strong> Miyabi, crouched down; her hands hugging her legs, spoke out, "Mio... Have you ever touched a mote of light from a Kevesi?"</p>
<p>Mio standing beside her holding her flute, shook her head. Miyabi wasn't looking at her; perhaps she wasn't expecting a reply anyways.</p>
<p>Miyabi held out her left hand, "They're the same as ours. On the other side, the people live hoping the same things as us."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As she looked at Noah whom started the melody, she brought out her flute and joined him. He looked at her for a second, the melody undisturbed. Blue moat rose from his costume as it sounded, illuminating the ground in its vicinity.</p>
<p>Taion: "Well, he's started now."</p>
<p>Lanz explained, "Sometimes... he's just... too kind."</p>
<p>Sena tried to support them, "That or he just loves his job."</p>
<p>Manana asked, "He too 'by the book'!"</p>
<p>Eunie replied, "An airhead -- that's what he is. Don't think he's thinkin' about it too deeply."</p>
<p>Lanz crossed his arms, "Just doing it because it's part of his nature, eh?" Then, closed his eyes and shook his head, "Mmm... Weirdo."</p>
<p>Taion: "I concur."</p>
<p>"Mimi..."</p>
<p>Most of the essence floated straight up, as if into the heaven. As the melody ended, Mio stucked her flute back into her pocket, Noah's lowered it. He turned to her and apologized, "Sorry... You didn't have to help."</p>
<p>She shook her head, "It's fine. It's our duty."</p>
<p>"I'm worried... I didn't play well."</p>
<p>"But why? You did it expertly, just like last time."</p>
<p>"I still... can't stop shaking."</p>
<p>"Because of the Flame Clock?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... I was... terrified."</p>
<p>She looked up at the sky, lightheartedly told him, "Still... All thanks to your decision, we're alive." Then, she looked back at him, "You're really... something."</p>
<p>He didn't face her, "It was... a team effort." Then, he turned and look at the others, Ethel inclusive. Then, he looked up and see the final of the moats floating into the distance.</p>

<p>The ferronis, tilted on one side, its body features enshrouded in dust, rendering only its wheels and lights viewable. Dusty winds never stop blowing. The soldiers now woke from the ground, including Ethel's bodyguard. In the distance, we could see Ethel leading, the group followed behind. Oh, and a blurry platform, a rock <em>on</em> the platform, and a large fern, to add to the collection.</p>
<p>"Commander!" They dashed at her as they called out. The bodyguard first fixated his sights to Ethel's left, occupied by the Kevesi of the team, then to the right, where Mio and the other Agnians were following up.</p>
<p>"You're Agnus!" Alerted, he drew his blade, a broadsword like that of Lanz. Other soldiers behind him too. The group, including Noah's, got into a defensive posture, though didn't summon their blades.</p>
<p>"Lower your weapons, <strong>Bolearis!</strong>" Ethel ordered irrefutably.</p>
<p>Bolearis, the bodyguard, flabbergasted, "Come again?"</p>
<p>"I'll explain everything to you later. Please, Bolearis." She looked at him firmly, the last sentence in a softer tone.</p>
<p>Probably he wanted to grant her a favor, or maybe her orders were undoubted in nature, he obeyed, "Uh, sure..." The other soldiers withdrew their blades after him. The group cancelled their defensive posture afterwards.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Then it seems, the Flame Clock is indeed gone, as you say..." Ethel was examining her iris, the Flame Clock originally at the bottom left wasn't displayed anymore. Bolearis and another guy were checking their irises too.</p>
<p>"And yet... I'm seeing nothing of these symbols you speak of. It seems evident you possess something... that we do not have." Confusingly, despite not being an ouroboros, her right iris displayed a "full-ring" like that of an ouroboros; similarly with Bolearis. Though, she certainly don't seem like she could switch classes with any of the others; there wasn't any weapon symbols displayed.</p>
<p>Currently, they were inside a room, but we don't have a full view of the room. An "oil lamp" could be seen on a table behind Ethel. The room was relatively empty where the group stood.</p>
<p>"I see... Sorry. For getting you involved." Noah apologized.</p>
<p>"No need to apologize. Exceptional as this is, I consider it a blessing to be freed from constant battle." She folded her arms as she spoke; the others ended their Iris examination.</p>
<p>"Glad to hear you say that. I was pretty worried."</p>
<p>Mio: "Are you sure... it's OK for us... to be hanging around here?"</p>
<p>One of her hands on her waist, she explained, "My troops are under strict orders. It's true you three are affiliated with Agnus... but we also owe you our lives. We should count our blessings, no?"</p>
<hr />
<p>As they were leaving the ferronis, walking on the ground where the nurse-hat guy were dealing with lowering some levnises at the start of this chapter, soldiers on atop the platforms and standing by the sides, as if it's a "welcoming event," watched them as if they were a rare species living in the zoo. The ground floor of the ferronis where they walked seemed to have been cleared.{{footnote: Clearly, the ferronis already drove back to where it was originally at the beginning of this section.}} Mio and the others looked at the soldiers around them as they passed.</p>
<p>Eunie: "This feels awkward..."</p>
<p>Noah reassured, "We can stick it out."</p>
<p>Mio: "Sorry... This is kind of our fault."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it. You heard Ethel, right?"</p>
<p>"Mm-"She nodded as they walked out into the darkness, living quarters seen outside.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside their assigned barracks, with beds on both sides of the entrance, and stools directly facing the entrance. Everyone was sitting except for Taion (and the Nopons), whom was thinking and recalling, speaking out his thoughts, "The Consul we fought back there..."</p>
<p>He looked up, Eunie pressed forward, "Uh-huh?"</p>
<p>"Oddly... he was strikingly similar to our own Consul." Behind Taion was the entrance, it's zip/doors wide opened. Directly opposite them, it looked like some shops or canteens with unrecognizable structures, perhaps a storefront?</p>
<p>Lanz blurted out, "Both sides are gonna have Consuls. Why's that odd?"</p>
<p>"More accurately, not just similar... They're the same."</p>
<p>Noah's eyelids and voice raised, "They're the same...? Are they really?" He turned to Mio and Sena sitting opposite of him, and both nodded back.</p>
<p>Taion continued, "Our colonies regard each other as enemies. But... if the Consuls giving the orders are the same, it means..."</p>
<p>Lanz pressed for more, "It means...?"</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>Lanz impatiently demanded, "Come on... Just spit it out, man!"</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Are Consuls such a big deal? I thought they were everywhere, like your run-of-the-mill Nopon."</p>
<p>Both Riku and Manana jumped on their tiny feet, both "got shot by an arrow lying down"{{footnote: This is a Chinese phrase, called 躺着也中枪。}}, strongly rebutted against her comments "Riku refuse to let remark of Eunie slide."</p>
<p>Manana supported him, "Got that right! Nopon are rare species world cannot live without! Protect at all cost!" Both of them had their wings tucked, as if they put their "hands" around their "waist".</p>
<p>Feeling awkward, Sena returned to the subject, "Uhh... Leaving Nopon out of this..." She turned to face Taion, "What's this mean? That these guys are mega suspicious?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I suspect they may be more deeply involved than we thought."</p>
<p>Eunie turned her attention away from the Nopon towards him, prompting for more, "Involved how, though? With what?"</p>
<p>"With the reason why we fight... With deciding our fate."</p>
<p>"Our fate." Mio looked down and think. Moment of silence befalled them as they connected the chains of thoughts.</p>
<p>Eunie broke the silence, "And the Queens? You think... they're in cahoots?"</p>
<p>He prompted as he put his hands around his chest, "What can you tell us about your Queen?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "I think we've only laid eyes on her once. Right?" He turned to Noah.</p>
<p>Noah seconded, "Yeah, at the Homecoming, I think. She had long, silver hair..."</p>
<p>Eunie added to the description: "Yup, real dignified. Proper pretty wings too."</p>
<p>Mio asked, "Wings? Like yours, Eunie?"</p>
<p>She pinched her right wings with her hand as she replied, "Sort of... But they were much more of a shining white."</p>
<p>Sena took over the conversation as she recalled, "Well, as for <em>our</em> Queen... She was relly elegant... Refined and graceful... And her ears... They were super long!"</p>
<p>She gracefully appeared behind Mio and held her palms up behind her ears, showing how long they were compared to Mio's, "Up to here!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Hmm... Guess that means our Queens are different folks all right."</p>
<p>Lanz: "The Consuls are... kinda like the Queen's servants, right?"</p>
<p>Taion: "The Castle's. Their role... is to convey the Queen's directives to the colonies, along with handling admin and decision-making."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So, what? If we explain the deal to the Queen, you think she might actually get the picture, yeah?"</p>
<p>Lanz was optimistic: "Pretty much."</p>
<p>Taion was rather pessimistic, "I don't recommend getting your hopes up."</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah?"</p>
<p>Pushing his eyeglasses up, he continued, "The Queens sit at the very pinnacle of the hierarchy."</p>
<p>In a lower tone, more disappointments, "So you think they won't even give us the time of day, huh?"</p>
<p>"I'm <em>saying</em> they might be the same as the Consuls: our enemy."</p>
<p>Eunie, shocked, hadn't considered that thought: "What?" All enjoyed a moment of silence as they tried to digest the theory. Sena had sat back at her original seat, on her bed.</p>
<p>Mio added, "Also... Somehow, that Consul... He became Moebius."</p>
<p>Noah: "Or maybe... Moebius <em>is</em> the Consuls." Taion nodded to his conclusion.</p>
<p>Taion continued, "The situation's already dire enough. It'd be best to temper our expectations." The group fell into silence as someone sighed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Atop the Kevesi castle. From this angle, we could see the double-flame-clock (6 o'clock-12 o'clock clockwise Agnian flames, anticlockwise Kevesi flame.) Two "thunder needle" pierced to the dark clouds above it. It seemed like the clouds was mixed with black fog.</p>
<p>Inside the queen's room, The Queen stood at her "seat" while soldiers lined up on both sides of the central pathway. A Consul was seen reporting to the Kevesi Queen.</p>
<p>"Is that so?" The Queen asked. "Colony 4..." The Consul, wearing a  helmet that looked like a duck with its beak twisted pointing downwards, some wavy shape at both side of the helmet, skinny, and nothing else stood out, nodded.</p>
<p>The Queen held her staff, pointing it in front of her, ordered, sounding venomously, "Henceforth... all orders are rescinded. Eliminate Ouroboros at all cost! Make this known throughout the colonies!"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Agnian Castle, itself a building behind gates and walls. The building's has a square base, followed by a reversed pyramidon top of it, joined by a smaller room on its seemingly second or third floor. The largest square area was at the penultimate layer, covered a "normal" roof (that slanted down) as the final layer, and some roof designs like flaps.</p>
<p>Inside the room, the Queen stood on her "seat", a taller platform. Some flames were lit atop a metal pot that were placed on 3-legged stands. The tiles looked wooden, to translator, comparable with ancient Greek designs. Soldiers lined in a "triangular" shape, and probably a Consul reporting to her, though with the darkness, we couldn't see clearly other than its outer figure.</p>
<p>The Agnian Queen, wearing a mask, short hair, 'very tall ears' (looked to translator like metallic horns, to be honest), announced acrimoniously, "Ouroboros... has no place in this world. Their existence... must be erased without a trace!"</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Update on the diamonds:</strong> Four rows of diamonds slashed out, the fifth row 2 of 5 slashed. Seemingly, 10 days had passed since the previous chapter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's Diary</strong>: We have endured the fierce fighting at Colony 4, and learned that the Consuls and Moebius are one and the same. Truths we took for granted continue to crumble at our feet... We have spent so long blindly walking the path set before us, without question. But we are more curious now, of our future selves... Of our purpose...</p>

<p>Cliffs higher than the clouds boundaried the valley, where steps of giant, long waterfall splashed on the lake below, creating misty vapor that shrouded its leg. Plants grown horizontally hung between the waterfall, and to both sides. A huge Agnian Ferronis stood with its two legs on the same level as the lake. On an island in front of it, several soldiers could be seen standing and communicating.</p>
<p>An Agnian, gelled spiky short hair, some remnants of his hair cut short by his ears, checking his iris, "... So, split into 3 units, our main troops go wide, and first to make contact withdraws...? What are you, a coward?"</p>
<p>Behind him stood a female soldier, young, seemingly having cat-ear-shaped hair, grew to her neck. At her left, a blue-haired Agnian, both ears with cyan crystals. They were checking their irises. Directly in front of him stood Taion, which the guy directed his speech to; and to Taion's right, a brown-skinned smooth long hair tied to a pony-tail boy, also checking his irises. A nurse-hat indigo-haired girl with some cyan-like horn, young, stood behind Taion.</p>
<p>Young Taion wasn't provoked by his remarks, "What was that?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" He replied blandly, a head taller than Taion.</p>
<p>Taion's body leaned forward, ardently pressed for more, "I asked you what you said! You think I'm scared, is that it?! I'll have you know my plan is textbook!"</p>
<p>The brown skin guy came forward and, with his arms, pushed him backward, "Drop it, Taion."</p>
<p>"...Let go!" Taion sniped at him, then he continued to speak to the gelled-hair, "Colony 13 is a complete enigma. Our data is incomplete."</p>
<p>The Agnian patiently rebutted, "It's just way too cautious, you clod. It's tedious, and it's dull." Then, he pointed to the Ferronis's Flame Clock, asked, "Can you see that?"</p>
<p>"If we don't eat now, we'll starve." The Flame Clock was only a-tenth filled, raising his voice, "We don't have the time to mess around!"</p>
<p>Taion rebutted, "What does-"</p>
<p>He cut Taion, lowering back his tone, "Look, Taiky-boy... I mean, we're <em>Iron Lambda</em>, yeah? The colony led by Commander <strong>Isurd</strong>. And this is some no-name backwater. We hit from the side, and we hit hard. Am I wrong?"</p>
<p>Taion scoffed for a while, lowering his head, floundered.</p>
<p>The guy pressed on, "What we need is momentum! Gotta play hard to win big!" He left Taion speechless.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a tent room, lit by standing lights. Taion, with his dull face, stood while a female's voice sounded, "Right, I see..."</p>
<p>A female standing front-right of Taion was checking her iris. She had a clover-shaped brown string tied to her chest and beside her skirt. She had indigo hair, indigo iris, half of her forehead covered by hair, while the other part had 2 cyan translucent ice crystal pikes grew out like a horn. The crystal like structure also covered her palm and half of her arm adjoining her palm. She continued, "One team draws the sentries away, then the main force can strike en masse, where the flank will be left loosely defended."</p>
<p>On the map,{{footnote: Surprisingly, flame clock showed gauge half-filled, doesn't seem to fit the previous scene.}} four blue dots on one side drawing many triangles{{footnote: One counted seven.}} away to the right of the map, and there were three other blue dots to the left of the map. As she spoke, the three blue dots on the left moved towards a large triangle at the top left, probably Kevesi's ferronis. The four blue dot engaged with the smaller triangles following them on the right. "Seems optimal."</p>
<p>The girl stood in front of a table. Seated behind the table was a guy, probably Commander Isurd, scruffy-haired. The girl turned to Taion, "Is that right, Taion?"</p>
<p>Taion wasn't focusing, softly replied after the initial 'what is happening', "Huh-? Yes. Correct."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as their eyes met. "All right. If that's your opinion, we'll approve it. Yes, Isurd?" She turned to face the commander behind the table.</p>
<p>We can see there was two blue lines that drew like tears down both side of his face, extending from the midpoint of his eyes towards his neck. It continued above on his forehead, joined with a dip at the middle, with an "I" or "1" above it. He agreed, "Yes. If you say it'll work, I trust you. Happy, Taion?"</p>
<p>"Y-yes..." Taion weakly replied.</p>
<p>An Agnian soldier entered the tent at this moment, drawing their attention, "Commander, Strategist. It's almost time. The new Consul should be arriving from the Castle soon."</p>
<p>Isurd replied, "Of course. On my way."</p>
<p>The girl took out a time-showing machine that looked like a stopwatch with a cover from the back of her pocket, "My, that time already?" It was showing 9 o'clock. As Isurd walked to the front from behind the table, he prompted, "<strong>Nimue</strong>, why are you still using that gizmo?"</p>
<p>Nimue rebutted, "Now, that's not very polite, Isurd. This mechanical 'gizmo' is much more precise than the Iris clock... And unaffected by the black fog. Right, Taion?"</p>
<p>Taion, still lost in his thought, he stuttered back, "Huh? R-right...!" Their eyes met for a moment, the commander smiled for a while as he walked off, Nimue followed behind, and the soldier followed, exiting the tent. Taion saw them off.</p>
<hr />
<p>In absolute darkness, someone wearing a Kevesi suit with a helmet, his eyes leaves a red trail as he moved, fired something at a distance. It landed in front of some Agnian soldiers, creating purple fog (Maybe poison? Certainly not black fog.) that blocked their vision and their oxygen intake.  An Agnian soldier, holding his twin blades, cried out, "I can't see a thing! Seargeant?! Where are you?! Seargeant?!" He looked around him as he spoke.</p>
<p>"Wha... What's going on?!" A Kevesi soldier moved behind an Agnian soldier as he was still figuring out the situation, drew out his blade, and stuck it on him. His 'lives' escaped immediately. Other soldiers, one by one, were no different.</p>
<p>"Agh!" More and more soldiers die, only one with twin blades managed to ran out of the thick purple fog, mixed with 'lives'. As he exit the fog, he fell to the ground, his blades sheathed. Kevesi soldiers watched him struggled, slowly approaching from behind. As he tried to crawl away, the soldier arrived and stuck his blade onto him. He immediately returned to the Queen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Agnian soldiers ran through a platform, arrived at the artificial bank of a gushing stream. They turned and faced the other direction. Purple smoke engulfed the distant area. We could see man-made structure in the huge cavern, seemingly a mine. Nimue and Taion was between the team.</p>
<p>Nimue turned and faced Taion, "There should be an exit through the southern water vein. Head straight for that."</p>
<p>Taion: "And you, Ma'am?"</p>
<p>"We'll hold the line here, keep them occupied."</p>
<p>Taion stomped forward, pugnaciously stared at her, "Begging your pardon, that's idiocy. And certain death!"</p>
<p>"Taion..." She took few steps forward and put both her hands on Taion's shoulders.</p>
<p>"You can't..."</p>
<p>"You all still have a future. Until the day of your Homecoming... Please, just live." Then, she held up his right hand, "And here..." She put the stopwatch into his hands.</p>
<p>Taion was afraid, "I-I couldn't...!" He looked up at Nimue, "I won't! Don't do this, ma'am!"</p>
<p>"Listen. I need you to live, Taion. You must! Flee for the colony!" She was smiling at him, he felt he's gonna lost something in this moment, his mouth wide opened, dumbstruck.</p>
<p>Nimue turned and dashed into the distance, several faceless soldiers followed behind. The young soldiers, the brown skinned pony-tail guy from earlier shouted, "Taion, get moving! Hurry!"</p>
<p>Taion snapped, "How?! How can I?!" He was still looking at where Nimue left, his hands still held the stopwatch. The young soldier with her ears crystal left, the pony-tail soldier grabbed Taion's by his left arm, dragged him along, "Taion!"</p>
<p>"Ma'am!" Taion shouted back, her hands stretched as if to reach Nimue.{{footnote: He probably kept the stopwatch not in the scene, otherwise, it would had dropped if not, given he reached his hands out palms wide opened, facing down.}}</p>
<p>They jumped into the gushing current. As Taion emerged from underwater, as he was being washed with the current towards an opening, probably a waterfall, shouted with despair, "Ma'am! Nimue!"</p>
<hr />
<p>A light came on, a Moebius wearing a feathered cape appeared, "Shouldnt've put so much stock in your Irises, K." He had a "horn" structure that stick out behind his helmet, like the motorcycle exhaust pipes, and some "earrings" that hung at the middle of the horn. "That is what you get!"</p>
<p>The moebius with a W on his head rebutted, "It's just bad luck. The plan was sound. If not for the black fog."</p>
<p>Ok, not a single horn, but double horn, the first moebius, looking from this angle. It looked like the moebius Noah and Mio first fought to the translator, "It's all about the skinfeel. You've only got eyes up front. That's why K lost. Sounds, the air, breathing... When you can feel all that, you don't need the Iris."</p>
<p>A female moebius, tall hat like that of a chef, and a fat ring wrapped around her neck, "And for all that, you still slunk back, tail between legs. Are you forgetting that fact?"</p>
<p>That fat moebius with fan-like structure sticking from his eyebrow teased, "Hehehehehehe, He's awful forgetful, isn't he? Huh!{{footnote: This sounded with the Chinese "fourth tone", rather than "second tone".}}"</p>
<p>The bull moebius crossed his hands, rebutted, "So? I'm still breathing, ain't I? I had a ball with them kids, right until I had to scarper."</p>
<p>The snakehead Medusa moebius came online, "Excuses are ten a penny."</p>
<p>The cowhead took a step forward at the medusa, "What are you implying...?"</p>
<p>"'Scuse me...?" A joker hat walked into the scene, "Is this a private party, or can I interject?" (S)He{{footnote: Some words are male-ish, other words were spoken feminine. The gender, hence, can't be determined via the voice alone.}} continued, "I was thinking I might head out alone next. Is that allowed?"</p>
<p>The cowhead interjected, folded his arms, "You wanna see with your own Iris, eh?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much."</p>
<p>Then, (s)he put his/her hands on the back of his/her neck, in a relaxed posture, "Plus there's Isurd in Colony Lambda, right? It'll be an extremely amusing situation. Don't you think?" Then, (s)he put his/her hands down, "Yeah. We'll have fun. I'm sure."</p>
<p>The cowhead first nodded in agreement, the lights went dark. Others followed to agree before leaving. He turned to his back before the lights went out.</p>

<p>Bolearis was speaking a a guy as he looked beside him. Then, he continued a sentence with him{{footnote: Maybe something like "continue later"?}} before walking off. Noah and the others were entering the ferronis as he approached, asked, "You lot sleep all right?" The person he talked to walked off towards another direction.</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah, like a log. Thanks for the room. You cleaned it out just for us?"</p>
<p>Borealis shook his head, "Nah, don't sweat it. Just a token from us higher-ups. My Iris's clock... I couldn't quite believe it."</p>
<p>The scene turned to the barren desert outside, "hox" with brown manes, a horn, black fur, and a squirrel-like tail scurried around. A lake or an oasis could be seen by the distance, with a red-leaf tree grew on this side, and some taller rocks that made up walls on the other side. Grass grew sparingly amongst the sandy dirt.</p>
<p>"So I went outside, hunted down a Hox as a test."</p>
<p>"And?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, in an exciting tone: "Didn't get snuff all. The Flame Clock didn't show, and neither did any motes." Then, he calmly spoke, "Looks like it's real."</p>
<p>Noah nodded: "Yeah. We were baffled too, at first."</p>
<p>"Anyway, we're all thankful to you. Flame Clocks don't work so good when you're Dirt. Hated having to worry about when my number might be up."</p>
<p>Lanz instantaneously reacted, "Wait, Dirt...? I thought Ethel's rank was Silver? It was when she saved our hides, wasn't it?"</p>
<p>Borealis looked for a while, then closed his eyes, "Well. Snuff happens."</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="start-of-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-1">(Start of Memories)</a></h4>
<p>Borealis continued to speak to the team as he recalled, "Cammuravi... Heard of him?"</p>
<p>In a battleground covered by dark dirt. Nothing was growing in the area. The distant mountains enclosed the duet ground. A guy with a hand by his forehead, a short beard along his chin to his ears, having a flaming head and flaming red-painted shoulder plate, his weapon that of a broad-tipped yellow-green glowing spear. He was driving a ferronis, inside its control room.</p>
<p>"Call him the 'Smoldering'."</p>
<p>His ferronis, a flame clock in the middle of his chest, with some plates that stuck out of his shoulders and back, wielded a flaming spear. At the distance, we could see another Agnian ferronis not joining the fight. Levnises were seen lined up in front of the "living quarter" ferronis.</p>
<p>"The greatest warrior in all of Agnus. The commander loves to spar with the guy."</p>
<p>Ethel wielded another ferronis, with rings to its shouders, wielding dual sword, fighting Cammuravi.</p>
<p>Mio: "I know him. They say his spear technique is unparalled; that and he's an ace Ferronis pilot. Wow... So Cammuravi and Ethel were rivals..."</p>
<p>Soldiers, including Bolearis, stood straight with levnises behind them, watched the duel.</p>
<p>Borealis continued, "That's right. We've fought against him who knows how many times now. Took our share of damage... But then, so did they."</p>
<p>"One time, one of his Ferronis's knee joints blew clean out." Electric sparks appeared on Cammuravi's ferronis's right knee joint, causing it to fell to the ground. Ethel took the chance and slayed fragments out of Cammuravi's ferronis as it fell backwards. Cammuravi climbed out of his ferronis thereafter.</p>
<p>"Ahh, most likely, it was a failure of maintenance. The commander could've ended it then and there."</p>
<p>Ethel's ferronis's sword pointed at Cammuravi as he knelt{{footnote: Because he was getting up, so he knelt, of course.}} Ethel did nothing to him. They looked at each other, not moving. Ethel looked through the eyes of her ferronis.</p>
<p>"But no..."</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-1">(End of Memories)</a></h4>
<p>Ethel approached from behind him, "Telling other people's tales again? Not very endearing. Cut it out." She stopped beside Bolearis, looking at him.</p>
<p>Bolearis was shocked by her appearing, shouted, "C-Commander?! A-apologies, ma'am..."</p>
<p>She scoffed, "I'm joking."</p>
<p>Noah prompted for a continuation, or maybe, for an explanation: "Ethel."</p>
<p>Ethel continued, "It became a tremendous scandal. The Castle stripped our colony of our Silver rank, demoting us to Dirt." Then, she turned to her right, looking over Bolearis, "but look!" The other faced where she looked.</p>
<p>Soldiers were meddling with the hexagonal-prism-shaped cylinder. Some soldier were soldering something. Others stood as they listened to a higher ups speaking, then did the Kevesi welcoming stance.</p>
<p>"They were made the lowest of the low... and still they chose to stick by me. Even though it meant having to live day to day... That, is why I must prevail, over him."</p>
<p>Mio, in her <strong>appreciation stance</strong> (palms wraping around fist, put it to her chest, optionally looking down if she's thinking): "Huh? But you're..."</p>
<p>"Free from the yoke of the Flame Clock, yes certainly. However, this is another matter." She folded her hands and shook her head.</p>
<p>Noah wanted something more precise: "What is it about, then?"</p>
<p>"Hunger. Pride. Desire. Joy, maybe... It's a little hard to put into words... But something along those lines. I haven't all the time in the world,... and my troops understand this full well. For me..." She paused for a while, "well, all of us, really... a rematch with Cammuravi is everything. And that... will give purpose to the remainder of our lives."</p>
<p>Mio: "A purpose... to life..."</p>
<p>As Mio was thinking and absorbing, Taion interrupted, "Right, OK... On an emotional level, I could understand."</p>
<p>Eunie was fascinated that a logic-head could be 'emotional', folded her hand and teased, "Wow, really?"</p>
<p>Taion rebutted, "I didn't say I agreed. I just see her point of view, that's all."</p>
<p>Ethel: "Ahh all right now. Let's put a pin in the philosophizing." She turned to Noah, changing the topic, "When we talked last night, you said your destination was... Swordmarch, as I recall?"</p>
<p>"Right." Noah nodded.</p>
<p>"Come along." She and Bolearis lead the way.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the ferronis commander's room, tables arranged in a rectangular shape with 3 sides closed, the only side opened was towards the entrance. The group stood there facing the glass panes (windows). Ethel was transferring data to their iris.</p>
<p>"This right here is Swordmarch." A map came onto their screen. There was a huge hole in the middle of the map, presumably not land, or maybe impassable. "Well, that part is common knowledge, I suppose."</p>
<p>Ethel continued, "To get there, you have a few possible routes." Plotted on the left of the 'impassable'{{footnote: We'll assume it's impassable without special transport.}} was their current location, and they need to get to the right. "Mainly, the northern and the southern." (Both routes go around the impassable). The southern route seemed like lands, nothing too special. The northern route seemed to be joined by something "empty", and since they aren't impassable, we'll assume it's water bodies for now, maybe sea or ocean, given their wideness.</p>
<p>"And then, the direct route, cutting through the ocean vortex." This directly cut through the 'impassable', the ocean vortex as they called it.</p>
<p>Taion, in a shocking voice, "You don't say... That works?"</p>
<p>Ethel shook her head, "Nobody's done it before."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Such a tease..."</p>
<p>Strong winds, that comparable to a giant hurricane or giant tornadoes, blew on the surface of a sea, drawing misty water vapor with it. A Kevesi ferronis is seen trying to penetrate the strong wind. "You can try to approach it from sea or from air..."</p>
<p>"but soon as you're close to it, you'll end up being ripped to shreds." Electric sparkles from the ferronis, itself blasting into flames, taken up into the tornado as it blasted completely.</p>
<p>"Trust me, it's not just the waves and the wind. We believe there's some other force at play there. And so... Through elimination then, these two." The line that cut through the 'impassable' was erased from the map, and she continued, "and quite frankly, I wouldn't advise going north." The northern line changed from blue to red.</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Why's that?"</p>
<p>Ethel took her fingers off her temple, "the road's dangerous, and it runs right past Agnus Castle territory. You'd have a hard time getting through." She shook her head.</p>
<p>Sena praised Taion, "Taion, turns out you were right!"</p>
<p>Taion pushed up his glasses as he enjoyed the vanity, "As always."</p>
<p>Ethel added, "Additionally, you are Ouroboros. If you face another Colony, you may find the same thing happening as did with us."</p>
<p>Lanz folded his arms: "I'd feel safe betting on it."</p>
<p>Ethel continued, "If you go south, the battle lines are relatively fixed. If you can proceed along this route, you'll get there in about two months."</p>
<p>Mio looked down, "Two months..."</p>
<p>Noah sighed.</p>
<p>Ethel degraded their hope even more: "But..."</p>
<p>Sena: "But? There's more?"</p>
<p>"Even if you reach the Sword... This... 'City', yes? It's hard to believe you would find it there. It seems far-fetched."</p>
<p>Noah: "How so?"</p>
<p>Ethel shared an experience, shooked her head "Once, we had to advance across this region ourselves. It was empty. Nothing but the Sword piercing the landscape. And then... There's that word you mentioned, 'City'. What could that possibly mean? Is it a person? Or a thing?"</p>
<p>Eunie turned to Lanz, "When Guernica talked about it, it sounded kinda like a colony...?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Uh...? I was pretty sure it was an object..."</p>
<p>Ethel pressed on, "Will you still go there? Regardless?"</p>
<p>Noah nodded, affirmed, "Yeah... That was the idea... For a chance to live on." Mio looked at him, as well as Ethel. There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Ethel disrupted the silence, closed her eyes, "Then there's no more to say. Bolearis!" She turned to face him, whom stood straight like a palm.</p>
<p>"Ma'am!" He shouted back.</p>
<p>"Our guests will be leaving soon. Let's give them any assistance we can."</p>
<p>"No worries!"</p>
<p>Then, she turned to the group: "Feel free to use the facilities here at your leisure. Get ready for what's ahead."</p>
<hr />
<p>In front of a canteen, Mio and Sena could be seen lining up by a canteen to take some food. A kevesi soldier before them took two rolls with mixed stuffs inside, unrecognizable to the translator, two brown buns maybe, and some tomato-colored soup, all on a tray with sections, before he walked off. Two trays could be seen put in front of Mio and Sena, the rolls weren't ready yet so they waited. Sena was looking down nervously. Soldiers like the brute guy who talked about Ardun meat to the nurse-hat stood at one leg of the tent with another female soldier, looking at them. Other soldiers seated by the table or walking in the canteen looked in their direction too. Mio was undisturbed.</p>
<p>Sena turned to Mio, "Uhh, Mimi...?"</p>
<p>She loudly replied without shame, "Relax. We're just doing what Ethel said. Just using the facilities at our leisure. You have to eat, else you won't grow."</p>
<p>Sena eyed the soldiers from the tip of her eyes, whispered, "It's just..."</p>
<p>"Don't let them get to you, yeah?" She smiled back at Sena.</p>
<p>"Ummm...{{footnote: On the verge of crying sound.}}"</p>
<p>Someone sounded from behind, "Hey." They turned. It was the third guy when they first released their flame clocks, stood beside Bolearis and behind Ethel when they first drove the fallen ferronis back to its original location. He had some weird scruffy hairs covering one side of his forehead, and his ears too. He stood behind the girls as they turned to face him.</p>
<p>He showed them something, to which Mio asked, "What is this?" Translator couldn't recognize the object, probably a brown hankerchief? Or some remnants of clothes?</p>
<p>He continued, "It used to belong to my friend. He always wore it, till last year." Mio breathed in deeply.</p>
<p>"Yes. He died. Fighting against Colony Psi. You animals killed him. Shot him right here." He pointed his index finger at Mio's glabella{{footnote: Actually, moving up the glabella, you'd find a hole. Unfortunately, one couldn't find what it's called.}}, "Clean through." He put his index finger down.</p>
<p>Sena shouted back at him, "You're wrong! We're actually from Colony Gam-"</p>
<p>Mio raised her hand in front of Sena to silence her.</p>
<p>"Mimi, what?"</p>
<p>Mio ignored Sena, looked at him as she put down her hand, "If that's what you want, go ahead and shoot. It's not like I'm a hard target."</p>
<p>"Now we're talking." He looked at her term symbol, sneered, "Oh, what? You're nearly done anyway. Well then, keep your lousy embers. Die today, or in three months' time... Not much difference." Mio gasped.</p>
<p>He turned his body to his side, head still on Mio, "Ah, just... mind you don't get poisoned before your time's up." They watched as he walked away.</p>
<p>Sena commented, "What a jerk! So uncalled for."</p>
<p>"Sena. It's fine. He was right, we did kill people. Maybe not his friend, but certainly others." They turned back to face where their food tray was.</p>
<p>Sena rebutted, "We had no choice! If we hadn't've, we'd be goners."</p>
<p>Mio repeated: "We had no choice... Yeah, that was clear, until now. But not any more. Right?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh!" Sena nodded.</p>
<p>She turned to look at the guy, still walking in the distance, as Mio continued, "There's a chance... we can make amends. Even if we're misunderstood..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, some food was put on her tray. Hearing the sound, they turned and and found extra portions piling up, like hills, which translator counted 10 of them{{footnote: Oh, boy, that soldier whom only got two...}}. "Huh?"</p>
<p>The person whom served them, wearing a black short chef hat, having tanner skin to both sides, split at the middle of both his eyes, red iris, smiled to the girls, "On the house. Eat your fill, friend."</p>
<p>Mio: "Huh?"</p>
<p>"We're Dirt rank, remember? Life ain't easy here, but you did help. Besides... You gave us a choice. (pause) The choice not to fight. Now, we won't have to take others' lives. I've... I've wished for this. And you made it true. Thanks for that." He added the same mountaineous portion to Sena's tray before moving off.</p>
<p>Mio saw him off, smiling. At least she had made someone's life happier, despite.</p>

<p>One morning. Seated by the rectangular dining table, Lanz, seated at the short edge, took the lead, "OK. So what now?"</p>
<p>Taion, to his left, analyzed the situation: "I believe the southward route is currently blocked by rockfall. I would estimate that clearing it will take some time..."</p>
<p>Noah, seated directly in front of Taion, agreed: "I guess we'll just have to wait till it's done..."</p>
<p>Mio, sitting next to Taion: "Uh, guys. Can I say something?"</p>
<p>Eunie, hamburgering Riku with Noah, got into a focused position, "Huh? Sounds heavy..."</p>
<p>"I've been thinking and... I think there might be something else that we could try."</p>
<p>Taion: "You mean, about Colony 4...? It's hardly your responsibility."</p>
<p>"Taion, it's not quite like that... I mean, if I see someone in trouble, I just want to help them. Maybe it's not a sense of responsibility, exactly. It's more like a natural reaction."</p>
<p>"Oh... You feel that even for a former enemy?"</p>
<p>She nodded. "That's how I feel about it... Right now, at least."</p>
<p>Sena, sitting next to Mio, "Mimi... Your heart's big enough for everyone to have a slice."</p>
<p>Noah seconded Mio, "OK, well, no time like the present! Let's do something to help!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, why not? Ethel helped us out way back, after all."</p>
<p>Eunie, getting back to her relaxed position{{footnote: With one foot on her chair.}}: "Now we've got a chance to give something back, right?"</p>
<p>Taion: "... I suppose it'll help us earn their trust. And kill a bit of time, maybe."</p>
<p>"I... I think Mimi's right!"</p>
<p>"Guys... Thanks."</p>
<p>Lanz, moving the topic forward, "Right, well, that was heartwarming, to be sure. But what are we going to do the help exactly?"</p>
<p>"Lanz, you need to expend some mental energy on it yourself instead of blurting questions. I get this may be tricky for you."</p>
<p>"Oi, watch it, buddy!" Lanz snapped back at Taion.</p>
<p>Noah suggested: "Well, if we're going to do that, perhaps a little intelligence-gathering is in order."</p>
<p>Eunie seconded, "Yeah, I guess we gotta. It's one thing to want to lend a hand, another to know where to stick it."</p>
<p>Mio: "I guess we'd better ask around the colony then!"</p>
<p>Sena looked down, "Hmm..."</p>
<p>Mio asked, "Still feeling weird about this?"</p>
<p>"N-no... It's just..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What, worried about helping the bad guys? It's a bit late for that, love. Anyway, if anyone tries to stir the pot again, we'll just punt 'em under a Levnis, right?" Then, she wryly glanced sidewards, "And by <em>'we'</em>, I mean Lanz, obviously."</p>
<p>Before Lanz could reply, Taion interrupted, "I'd like to call ixnay on the punting, if it's not too much bother. I'm afraid it would get quite messy."</p>
<p>Lanz: "C'mon... It was just a figure of speech, mate." Taion tilted his head aside in disagreement.</p>
<p>Noah: "OK then! Everyone good to start asking round the colony to find out how we can help?"</p>
<hr />
<p>(A day passed, evening. They were seating around another dining table at the canteen, after they gathered the intel.)</p>
<p>Noah took the head start: "All right, let's recap."</p>
<p>Taion: "Injuries from local monsters, trouble owing to the Colony's location... There were also some more urgent cases, with more wounded appearing by the day."</p>
<p>Sena: "Yeah, the medic team seemed super busy..."</p>
<p>Mio: "It sounded like they couldn't provide adequate care, so they had always more patients coming in."</p>
<p>Lanz suggested, folded his arms, "I got the feeling they could deal with the staffing problem if they didn't also have a 'not enough stuff' problem..."</p>
<p>Sena: "You mean, if they had, like, drugs and bandages?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Those kinds of medical supplies are difficult to craft without specialized facilities."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well, we're in the arse end of nowhere, and therefore bang out of luck."{{footnote: This is an unspeeched scene, so without the voice, one couldn't put emphasis or commas between sentences by one's ears.}}</p>
<p>Taion: "Precisely. It's only a matter of time before all the supplies start running out."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Spark it all. So what, we're up a creek with no paddle...?" The group breathed out hard, been going in circles.</p>
<p>Mio: "But we have to do something...!"</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Noah was thinking for a solution, eyes closed.</p>
<p>Taion: "...Ah! Hang on... No, that wouldn't... Or would it...?"</p>
<p>Eunie got annoyed, "Taion, if you've got something to say, then do, or by the Queen's knuckles, I'll slap you."</p>
<p>"Yes, but... Hmm, then again..." Confirmation is more important than Queen's knuckles, eh?</p>
<p>Noah prompted, "What is it, Taion?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Did you come up with something?"</p>
<p>"... First of all, I have to say there's no guarantee."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Spit it out, man. We can work out the kinks later."</p>
<p>"... I hear you. Then let's leave, this instant."</p>
<p>Eunie found it insane, "You wot? Oi! Where are we off to now?!"</p>
<p>"Galghour's Menhir. If we're lucky, we might make it in time."</p>
<p>"In time for what? You're not making sense!"</p>
<p>"I said we have to go this instant. I'll explain when we get there."</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie, drop it. Let's just do as he says." Eunie shook her head, but whatever.</p>
<hr />
<p>===</p>
<p>After the group left their tables, on the way to exiting the colony, Bolearis came running up towards them, "Hey, you lot! Got a second?" He sounded agitated, like he lost his coolness.</p>
<p>Noah prompted, "What's up, Bolearis?"</p>
<p>"It's the commander!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "What's the commander?"</p>
<p>"I haven't seen her for ages! Do you know where she is?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Um, I don't think we've seen her?"</p>
<p>"Are you sure? You haven't seen her at all? Think very carefully!" He bombarded them with really fast speech. The group looked at each other, they shook their head, raised their arms, shrugged.</p>
<p>Bolearis was disappointed, spitting out his worries, "She wouldn't hesitate to die for the colony if it came down to it! And she's so strong, that she'll bear any burden alone, however heavy! If anything were to happen to her, then Colony 4... then we'd...!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "OK, OK, calm down."</p>
<p>"Ugh... S-sorry. Got carried away."</p>
<p>"Yeah... Yeah, don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"If you see her, just tell me, OK? Sorry to have kept you."</p>
<p>Noah: "Y-yeah..." Then, he walked off in the direction of the ferronis, the others towards the left where the entrance was.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Outside at an elevated platform, probably Galghour's Menhir)</p>
<p>Noah saw Ethel in the distance: "Ethel?" Where she stood, the ferronis lay in the distance to the left.</p>
<p>Ethel turned as the group approached her, "Oh, it's you..."</p>
<p>Mio prompted, "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"That's what I was-" Ethel shook her head.</p>
<p>Something caught Sena's eyes, "Wait, look over there!"</p>
<p>To their right, there was a huge patch of red smoke arising. It came from behind a half-buried ring.</p>
<p>Noah was reminded of something: "Was that a supply drop?"</p>
<p>Ethel replied, "Yes. Sent from Agnus."</p>
<p>Noah: "How can you tell?" Behind them, quicksand was flowing down from a higher platform.</p>
<p>"We got word that an advance troop from Agnus had been seen in the area. And if they're in the middle of enemy territory, it has to be due to some kind of operation. The supply drop must be timed for the arrival of a main force."</p>
<p>Taion cut in, "Funnily enough, it's that supply drop we're after."</p>
<p>The others were surprised, and Noah prompted, "Did you know about the Agnian troops, Taion?"</p>
<p>"I've known about the presence of Agnian forces in this region for a while. I could never verify that supplies were being dropped, but I won't say I didn't suspect."</p>
<p>Eunie stoically replied, "Oh yeah? Well, looks like you can verify it now."</p>
<p>Ethel figured their motives from their conversations, "From the way that you're talking, it sounds as though you're after supplies too."</p>
<p>Noah explained, "Well, medical supplies specifically. We thought Colony 4 might need them."</p>
<p>"I see. Then it looks as though we happen to have the same goal."</p>
<p>Mio was surprised: "Really...?"</p>
<p>Lanz complained to her: "Bolearis was looking for you. You didn't actually come alone, did you?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh... I actually did. Your understanding of the situation is correct." She shook her head, "and I can't risk any more casualties."</p>
<p>"So you thought you'd go and take care of this yourself, huh." A giant triceraptor-like creature lurked in the distance, very near to the ferronis wheel.</p>
<p>Mio: "In that case, we-"</p>
<p>"I said I couldn't afford any more casualties, and that includes you. I appreciate that you're willing, but Colony 4 is my responsibility."</p>
<p>Noah reprimanded, "We want to work with you, Ethel."</p>
<p>"Be that as it may..."</p>
<p>Mio cut her off, "We've already made our minds up. That's why we're here."</p>
<p>Ethel tried to dissuade her, "You might end up having to cross swords with people from your own country.{{footnote: Do they have the idea of 'country'?}}" Noah looked at Mio. She got into her appreciation stance, didn't know how to choose for the moment.</p>
<p>Noah helped her redirect the question back at Ethel, attracting her attention, "Talking about avoiding casualties... You know that includes you too, Ethel, don't you?" Mio looked back at Ethel, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>"Hm..." Ethel lowered her eyebrow, sternly looking at him. Noah frowned back, weren't willing to give in either.</p>
<p>Ethel finally compromised, "... I yield. I can't very well refuse you now."</p>
<p>Lanz affirmed, "Don't worry, Ethel. We're not who we used to be." He's referring to their kids stage long ago when Ethel saved them.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, we won't drag you down."</p>
<p>Taion ushered, "Then if we're agreed, let's hurry and pick up those supplies."</p>
<p>"Apologies. And thank you all."</p>
<hr />
<p>Nighttime. As they approached, they saw two Agnian soldiers standing in front of the supplies, surrounded by wolves. Several Agnian corpses were already lying around them.</p>
<p>Lanz: "H-Hey... Something's not right."</p>
<p>Sena: "W-what do we do?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Noah: "No time to daydream. We have to hurry!" Ethel made the first move, summoned her blade and ran towards the wolves, slicing one on her way and killing it.</p>
<p>The group caught up from behind, Noah shouting to her, "Ethel!"</p>
<p>"You're right, Noah. We have no time to waste... Let's rout those nuisances." Together, they summoned their blades and face the wolves, which now turned to face them. The two Agnian soldiers ran off to the side, away from battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the fight.)</p>
<p>Lanz, after sheathing his blade: "Phew, glad that's over."</p>
<p>The rest of the group sheathed their blades too, except Ethel. Eunie reminded them, "Yeah, just one thing left." The two injured Agnian soldiers were standing between them and the supplies.</p>
<p>Mio, in a whisper{{footnote: Ethel probably didn't hear her, but we don't know}}: "Ethel." She wouldn't want to have their blades pointed at Agnian soldiers, but she couldn't help Ethel made her decision, either. She was worried about her decision.</p>
<p>"Huh." Ethel sheathed her blade, to the Agnus soldier's surprise.</p>
<p>"Wh-what?"</p>
<p>She shouted at them: "Take your wounded and get out." A second later, she shouted to them sternly, "Leave now." They quickly ran off into the distance as she watched them off.</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, directing her question, "Did I do the right thing just now... as a Kevesi commander?"</p>
<p>Noah reaffirmed, "There was never a reason for any of us to fight in the first place. You did the right thing, in my opinion."</p>
<p>She turned and faced him, "<em>The actions you believe to be correct don't always lead to good outcomes</em>. Some situations aren't salvageable. That's the nature of war." Then, looking down on the ground, "It's beyond anyone's control..."</p>
<p>"Ethel..."</p>
<p>After having some time for herself, "I'm sorry. What a tedious thing to talk about." Then, she looked at the supply drop, "We'll recover the supplies and head back to Colony 4. I'm afraid I'll need you all a while longer."</p>
<hr />
<p>(After they recovered the supply drop, as they crossed the barricades to enter the colony)</p>
<p>Bolearis shouted from a distance, "Commander! Commander! Commander Ethel!!!" He ran up to her and complained, "I looked for you everywhere! Where in blazes were you?!"</p>
<p>Ethel patiently replied with instructions, "I went to fetch medical supplies. Distribute them to the med team."</p>
<p>Bolearis unconsciously acknowledged, "Yes ma'am, I'll-" Then, he realized he almost got sidetracked, "W- ah, wait! No, Oh no, no you don't!"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry for making you worry. Just, please. I did this for everyone."</p>
<p>"I understand your feelings, but... Agh! Well, I suppose at least you're unharmed." He don't know how to put the situation into words, maybe.</p>
<p>Ethel turned to Noah's team: "That's twice you've helped me out. I owe you another one."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Nah, don't worry about it. We were acting of our own free will."</p>
<p>Ethel smiled back, "Then to reward your efforts, I'll work on getting our injured up and about again." Then, she turned to her bodyguard, "Come, Bolearis."</p>
<p>Bolearis did the Kevesi welcoming stance, "Uh! Coming!" Noah and the team watched as they walked off into the distance. Bolearis walked in line with Ethel, not like the usual one step behind.</p>
<p>Noah called out, "Ethel."</p>
<p>"Hm? What's wrong, Noah?" Noah closed the distance between them as both turned to face him. The rest of the group watched without moving.</p>
<p>"I was thinking about what you said. <strong><em>'The actions you believe to be correct don't always lead to good outcomes.'</em></strong> "</p>
<p>"Mm..."</p>
<p>"If someone like you says it, then I don't doubt it's probably true... But, back then. You helped us. You saved us. You risked your life. Thanks to you, we're alive right now. I can say with certainty, that's a good outcome. That's the only thing I'm certain of, actually."</p>
<p>"Noah, you..." She felt speechless. Lanz and Eunie came up front and stood one step behind Noah, to support him. "And we never properly thanked you."</p>
<p>Lanz was reminded: "Huh, so we didn't."</p>
<p>Eunie too: "Oh, yeah!"</p>
<p>Together, they did the Kevesi welcoming stance, with Noah speaking, "Silvercoat Ethel, we want to formally thank you for your courage."</p>
<p>Ethel lowered her eyebrow, "Heh..." She and Bolearis replied back with the Kevesi welcoming stance. She admitted, "I can hardly recognize the three of you." As she turned to her back, "I'll continue to do my best to live up to my nickname." Then, she walked off into the distance with Bolearis.</p>
<p>Mio got into her appreciation stance as she looked at the three.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-ethels-hero-quest"><a class="header" href="#end-of-ethels-hero-quest">(End of Ethel's Hero Quest)</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>A quiet night.</p>
<p>In their assigned barracks, Mio was alone, combing her hair, looking at a handheld palm-sized mirror. It reflected her term symbol. She looked at it closely, concerned, "Another bit... thinner, I think..."</p>
<p>"Haaaah... Best bath ever." Sena gleefully exclaimed as she got near the tent. Mio turned and saw her walking in, then returned to comb the left side of her hair with her right hand crossed over in front of her.</p>
<p>"Mm? You takin' a dip, Mimi? It's nice and warm!"</p>
<p>"Uh, I might skip today. It wasn't really a sweaty one..." She tried to sound confident, replying with loud and clear voice.</p>
<p>"Whaaaaat?! How can you miss a hot bath opportunity? Then again, I guess when you smell so nice already, maybe it's no problem" She walked and sit by her bed, facing Mio. Mio turned her head slightly to face her, but since she sat at the short edge of the bed, her body still faced forward.</p>
<p>Sena continued: "Are you, um... embarrassed about other people seeing you? There's no need to be! Miss Ethel thought of everything. She even managed to give us a window when the bath'd be empty."</p>
<p>Mio was looking down, her fingers pressed against her bed, perhaps thinking about something or maybe just ears facing Sena. As Sena finished, she looked at her, commented, "Ah, yes. I didn't know that." She smiled for a while before turning away, her smile faded, perhaps thinking about her time left, and what she wanted to do while she last.</p>
<p>Sena caught her tempestuousness slightly, but before she could think deeper, Mio stood up, "I guess maybe I will take... a dip."</p>
<p>Sena cheerily replied, "Attagirl!"</p>
<p>"Mm, OK. Don't wait for me."</p>
<p>"All right, then. Have a good one!" As she saw Mio off, "And g'nite!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, good night, Sena." She turned to face her as she was about to leave the tent, the last word was dampened.</p>
<p>After several steps, she stopped amidst the tents, in the middle of the road. Breathing out air, as if to breathe out all the worries and anguish, had a moment for herself, looking down at the soil. The street was empty. As she looked up, a three-quarter moon{{footnote: Wait there's moon??? After the world split and recombine??? Did they share a moon? It's unclear.}} hung high on the partially-clouded sky. Stars blanketed the dark nights. It's the end of another day.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning. Noah was checking his iris. He announced to the team, sitting and standing around in their tent, "They should be finished clearing the landslide soon. We'll be able to set out to Ribbi Flats."</p>
<p>Taion paid his tribute, "Colony 4's engineers are excellent. They took care of that faster than I thought they would."</p>
<p>Eunie: "I guess we'll be saying bye-bye to Colony 4."</p>
<p>Mio: "Ethel and the others have been good to us. I'd like to see her before I go."</p>
<p>Sena: "Yeah, I want to do that too."</p>
<p>Lanz: "I guess we all should. Let's go mob Command!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(In the command center)</p>
<p>Ethel: "I have to ask, before you go. Why is it that you stick together?"</p>
<p>Lanz thought it was due to situation, "Given what's what, we pretty much have to."</p>
<p>Taion accepted his explanation, added, "Considering how everybody attacks us on sight now..."</p>
<p>Noah: "At this point, I suppose... it just panned out this way."</p>
<p>Ethel disagreed: "You really think so? That's not really how it looks to me."</p>
<p>"Well, one thing's for sure. We were sworn enemies once. And yet, we all share the will to live in the now. Before becoming Ouroboros, I never realized. But that common will, it was reason enough to stick together."</p>
<p>"I see... Not everyone makes the choice to fight willingly. Lanz said that you <em>'have to'</em>. Well, right now every one of us has to." Then, she looked up, "There's no question it would be better if they didn't." She turned back at the group, "Your journey may have started out of necessity, but now, you're pushing forwards towards a common goal. And that... That might be all we want, and all that we wish the world could be."</p>
<p>Mio, focusing her sights on Ethel, picked up her words, murmured to herself, "<em>What we wish... it could be...?</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside by an entrance. A transporting levnis parked there lowered its front door. Some soldiers were boarding it with Ethel and Bolearis watching from behind. The group approached Ethel from her back. Noah prompted, "You're heading out as well?"</p>
<p>Ethel galvanized him, "As soon as we're done here, I'll make for the Castle."</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"You forget, I <em>am</em> the commander. We haven't revolted against our nation, so... I have to report in."</p>
<p>"Ethel, are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't worry. I'll be leaving you out of it."</p>
<p>Noah dissuaded, "That's not it. The Consul earlier turned Moebius. Were it to..."</p>
<p>"If you mean that monster, I'm well aware of the risk."</p>
<p>"Then why?" He asked softly.</p>
<p>"Because it's my responsibility to those I command. As for the Consul, we can say he died in an accident."</p>
<p>Lanz proposed after a short pause, "And you can't do it remotely?"</p>
<p>"Now that the Consul and Flame Clock are both lost to us, I have to make a report, and not over comms. I have to requisition more supplies, too."</p>
<p>Noah had a sense of foreboding, "And what if... What if they fit you with a new Clock?"</p>
<p>Ethel laughed it off, "Hah... I can worry about that then."</p>
<p>Lanz effetely asked: "You're fine with it? Really?"</p>
<p>"Don't get preoccupied with us. Keep to your path. Follow it, wherever it may lead you. <strong><em>Life is short.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Noah stoically replied, "I suppose."</p>
<p>Ethel: "Hey. While we're all still here, one more word of warning."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"The Consul was attempting to remove you from the picture. In light of that, you'll likely come up against hostility. But listen. You should keep engagement to a minimum. Keves, or Agnus. That goes for both of them."</p>
<p>Mio reprimanded, "But... If we break their Clocks, just like with Colony 4 here, they would... Well, they would be free, wouldn't they?"</p>
<p>"You'd do well to remember not everyone thinks the same as I do, even within this colony. Many still haven't come to accept their new reality."</p>
<p>Sena: "Ah!" She was reminded by the guy whom sneered at them earlier in the canteen.</p>
<p>"To make things even more fraught, in other colonies, there are those who are more than willing to fight... as you'd expect."</p>
<p>Taion summarized her warning, "So it's no use appealing to their sense of compassion or hoping they'll treat us fairly, is that it?"</p>
<p>Mio turned to look at him, scoffed at his conclusion. Ethel agreed, "Yes, precisely. You will change the fate of others, just by virtue of coming into contact with them. It's quite the burden. You may not want the responsibility."</p>
<p>Noah: "A burden... Perhaps..."</p>
<p>"All that said, you get embers on your coat, you have to brush them off. If push comes to shove, do not flinch. Do whatever it takes, for the greater good. I wish you all a smooth and fruitful journey."</p>
<p>Noah and Mio nodded back to her before turning left and continuing their path. The others followed behind.</p>
<p>As Ethel and Bolearis watched them off, Ethel commented, "Ouroboros, huh? If only... we could have been there as well..."</p>
<p>Bolearis turned to look at her. She strode in front of him almost immediately towards the (transporting) levnis, he followed behind.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After exiting the colony, before setting off)</p>
<p>Taion: "We should check the route data again. Make sure we're on the right path. We're on course for Swordmarch. But first, we'll need to take the south-east road through Ribbi Flats." They turned to face the direction they <em>are</em> to go. It was across a pond or small oasis where Borealis recalled where he killed some hox that lurked there before.</p>
<p>Noah: "Ah, yes. That's the route that Ethel recommended."</p>
<p>"Correct."</p>
<p>Mio: "She said the battlefront are pretty static at the moment, but do we have any intel about colony development?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "As far as Ethel and Colony 4 is concerned, we've got a pretty good idea... But what about any others?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "I wouldn't expect any shenanigans all the way out here..."</p>
<p>Noah: "In any case, we mustn't let our guard down along the way."</p>
<p>Taion, pushing his glasses up, "Danger could be lurking anywhere in the background, so insecurity stalks us... Not much we can do about that, though."</p>
<p>Lanz was optimistic, "Ah, c'mon man. We'll muddle through."</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "Let's hope so."</p>
<p>Noah: "Hey, I mean, if we run into another colony, it isn't necessarily a bad thing."</p>
<p>Lanz was pessimistic this time, "Uhh... Are you sure about that? It doesn't matter if we run into Agnus or Keves. Either one would mean getting into a dust-up."</p>
<p>Noah immediately forgot Ethel's warning, "True, but what I meant was... If we destroyed their Flame Clock, we'd set everyone free, like we did for Colony 4."</p>
<p>Eunie folded her arms, "Easy to say..."</p>
<p>"Well, sure, I mean... if conditions allow it."</p>
<p>Taion: "If we're 'brushing off embers', we'll have no choice in the matter."</p>
<p>Mio: "...That's right."</p>
<p>As the atmosphere got too pessimistic, Eunie tried to turn it around, "Hey, maybe it's better if we put off worrying about that until the time comes."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Eunie's speaking sense there."</p>
<p>Mio seconded, "True. We can just react to events as they happen. Play it by ear."</p>
<p>Sena was happy with that, "Gotcha! I'll apply myself to that!" They took off in to the distance thereafter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> By a riverside, some fluffy animals called "kapiba" could be seen, with yellow furs and poop-brown head, short horns, occpying a rocky river bank. Further ahead, green and brown grass carpeted the uneven surface. A triceraptor-like creature lurked in the distance. Trees that shoot up like pine were occasionally seen. Beyond, we could see tall mountaineous regions, sometimes screwlike, other times nail-like. Taos appeared in the distance. Another scene, water falls from a huge circular-ish hole down to a river below. The bank roofed by the water-falling platform looked sandy-white, while the opposite side of the bank, yellow-back green brogs made it their home, together with some trees. Yet another scene. Cloud lurks below the edge of the ground towards infinity. Triceraptor-like creatures occupied the platform. At a distance, we could see a tall cylindrical rock like an island on clouds with some unknown creatures{{footnote: This could only be seen on the morning scene, second video.}}. A Taos flew above the clouds. In the background, some snowy peaks hid behind thin clouds. It was the monster-shaped snowy mountain that got its body destroyed by an annihilation event we seen earlier. Despite being flat, this area had lots of staircased platforms, layer by layer. This, is <strong>Ribbi Flats</strong>, of Fornis Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group were walking up some rocky slope by a body of water to their right when Eunie called out, "Hey! Over there!" At the top of the slope was a tree. She turned to face the group, "If we set up camp there, we'll have good visibility. Think it's time we took a break?"</p>
<p>"Riku, for one, want to rest, anyway! Relentless walking has left legs like numbed-out sausages..."</p>
<p>Manana, triggered by food, waved her wings, "Sausages indeed! Mealtime is here!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Sounds good." Turning to Eunie, "Let's go for it, I say. Should we rest in shifts? I can take sentry duty first."</p>
<p>"Ah, Mimi! Let me back you up on that!"</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "OK! Then let's take a break there."</p>
<hr />
<p>Night time.</p>
<p>To the right of the path was the tree, a big rock stood beside the tree. The groups, seated in two, formed a diamond. Assuming the tree as the "top" of a diamond, Noah and Riku were on the "right edge" of the diamond, with Riku showing Noah something circular while he listened to him. Taion and Manana, him sitting by a table with his teapot and teacup, and Manana stood on top of a box with her tea served, talking to Taion. They were on the "left edge" of the diamond. Eunie and Lanz, perpedicular to each other, slept with their back on the tree trunk. A waterfall could be seen in the distance, beyond the road. Mio and Sena were looking in their direction, their back facing some laddered ledge, totalled probably a few meters high. Their emotions seemed neutral to one.</p>
<p>Further "right" of the diamond were ledge that seems to fall down to infinity, just empty space. Further, some taller ledges could be seen.</p>
<p>Perhaps something came into her mind, Sena sorrowly commented suddenly, "Meanies..."</p>
<p>"What was that, Sena?"</p>
<p>"It's just, I was up all night thinking. Those guys are so selfish."</p>
<p>Mio didn't get it, "Selfish how...?"</p>
<p>"You know what I mean! Every time we Interlink, they're the ones taking the lead! And me? All I do is watch..."</p>
<p>"Ohh, that's what you mean."</p>
<p>"Tell me you don't think so too?"</p>
<p>"Maybe not 'selfish', but like... 'Hey, why didn't you move that way?!', and stuff like that, yeah..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, right?!"</p>
<p>"So, you'd prefer to take the reins?"</p>
<p>Sena looked down, "I just wanna do more! Like, pull my weight... Y'know?"</p>
<p>Mio laughed at her, "Hahah, that's so you, Sena." She turned to look towards Noah and Riku, shared, "I think it's probably fine, though. They're just being protective, I think."</p>
<p>Sena looked at her, "Like what Noah said? Yeah.{{footnote: One can't be sure whether she answered her own question or...}}"</p>
<p>"I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure we'll get our turn." Noah was tuned in on Riku he didn't see her glancing at him.</p>
<p>"You sure?"</p>
<p>She turned to her and affirmed, "Yeah. Positive." They looked off in Eunie's direction, enjoying the moments of tranquility.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="start-of-valdis-hero-quest"><a class="header" href="#start-of-valdis-hero-quest">(Start of Valdi's Hero Quest)</a></h4>
<p>By a watering hole, water falling from a platform that stretched out far from a cliff wall. Sena was looking up towards their destination, with a trembling voice, "Probably shouldn't be climbing up this one, huh..."</p>
<p>Taion insisted on following the plan, "But, this is the route Ethel told us to take, no question."</p>
<p>Mio: "Well, I guess that means... We'll just, uh... have to keep going then." Where the group stood, tall grass grows as high as their ankle, with some patches of dark pink flowers less seen.</p>
<p>Zooming out to the very top, we can now see the group's head wasn't larger than a dot. Someone with probably lemon grass colored hair, a barrel-like backpack strapped to his upper shoulder, darker skin, looking downward.</p>
<p>As he stood up for his next action, someone ping him on his iris, "<em>Hey, <strong>Valdi</strong>? Where are you?</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh? Outside the colony."</p>
<p>"<em>Well yeah, I know that! It's bad. The Consul's searching for you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Gotcha! Just make up something." He had a gauntlet attached to his right hand, the gauntlet so huge it seems designed for someone twice his size. The central diamond and the left line plus its diamond was still red, his term symbol. He wore some microscopic goggles that people probably use for wielding on his forehead. He had a cylindrical object strapped to his right on his waist.</p>
<p>"<em>Sorry? 'Make up'?!</em>" From behind, two levnises came up, perhaps under his control: one for the wheel model Kevesi levnis, another with the four-legged model Kevesi levnis.{{footnote: If you remember in Chapter 1, before Eunie and the others took off, there are 2 types of Kevesi levnis, and there are also 2 types of Agnian levnis that joined the battle; at least, one only spotted these 2 types so far.}}</p>
<p>Back at the bottom, Noah signaled to the group, "Let's look for a place we can climb from. I'll take a look around here."</p>
<p>Eunie: "OK. I'll check out over here." Individually, they spreaded out searching. As Eunie strodded slowly towards a cliff wall, <em>Thud</em>! The four-legged levnis landed in front of her, sending dirt blanketing her direction.</p>
<p>"Oh, crap."{{footnote: Surprisingly, Eunie didn't jump backwards nor drawing her weapons unconsciously.}} She turned and ran after she complaint, her back facing the levnis. Manana felt the ground trembling, and noticed a wheeled levnis going after her, turned to her back and ran too!</p>
<p>Noah, from the distance, saw the group in danger, shouted to the rest of the group, "Guys, get back!" They gathered and ran towards Eunie and Manana, then faced the two levnises together. Valdi stood on top of one of his levnis, shouted to the group, frivolously{{footnote: Google Translate doesn't translate "中二", which is what describes his behavior right now; basically, it means a person whom read too much Chinese novels and cannot distinguish between living inside a novel or living outside the novel, so whatever they read inside the novel they brought it outside of the novel; similarly, those whom watched anime like Naruto etc. will also move around and not just dressed up like a Naruto, but also behave like Naruto.}}, "Ouroboros! Fight me!" He drew out his weapon, a lance-like gun.</p>
<p>Manana, now realizing out of danger, trodded in front of Valdi, complaining, "That was close call! Almost flattened like buttery pancake!"</p>
<p>Valdi looked at the nopon for a while, "Ah, sorry."</p>
<p>"Apology grudgingly accepted." The others in the group, in their defensive stance but without weapons drawn, was floundered, unsure of the situation.</p>
<p>Valdi politely asked, "Hey... Are you Ouroboros too?"</p>
<p>"Factually untrue. Manana is just Manana."</p>
<p>"Ahh, that's a relief! I really didn't want to have to fight a Nopon. Oh... Valdi, by the way. If I may?"</p>
<p>"Mmeh? Is pleasu-"</p>
<p>Taion couldn't stand it anymore, his Mondo swooped past Manana towards Valdi while shouting at them, "What are you guys doing?!"</p>
<p>Lanz bashed one of the levnis's leg. Valdi twisted to his back to dodge the Mondos, jumping to the ground, seeing it fun, "Woohoohoo! That was awesome!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "We're the ones you've got beef with. Come on, bring it!" The others drew their blade.</p>
<p>Valdi walked in front of his levnises as he unsheathed his weapon, laughed at them, "Hehe... You can't beat me. Here i come!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the battle)</p>
<p>Valdi was assessing the damage done to his levnises, enthused, "Whoa. The joints are all burned out... And the state of this armor." Then, turning to the group, "Hey, show me that again!"</p>
<p>Lanz, getting out of sync, "Show you what?"</p>
<p>In the distance, we could see some deer-like animal. Further, trees, fan-like leaves with reddish tips, and green pine-like trees. There were also some relatively narrow slopes that curved their way around the mountain body.</p>
<p>"Those moves you pulled! I've never seen anyone smash up a Levnis like that! I need to figure out how you guys managed to do it."</p>
<p>Riku disagreed, "Nothing to observe. Frame was structurally poor. Evident that driving wheel could not withstand torque."</p>
<p>"The driving wheel, you say..." Turning to assess the wheel and producing hypothesis, "I wonder if it's because it was upgraded from lightweight to a more heavy assault style? Did I mess up the handling? But the armor had to withstand a charge, I had to fudge the weight to keep a good turning circle..."</p>
<p>Riku watched him talking to himself, speechless... Valdi turned to face him after a while, "Yes... You're absolutely right! I can't believe you could tell with just one look! Hey, would you teach me everything you know?"</p>
<p>"Noah..." Riku couldn't handle it, seeking help.</p>
<p>"Uh... Who exactly are you?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm Valdi. Levnis builder from Colony 30! I heard that anyone who defeats you gets a whole buttload of supplies from the Castle as a reward... But err yeah{{footnote: This had been fitted to the voice than the wordings.}}, you won, so it's all good."</p>
<p>Lanz, being hypersensitive, snapped at him, "Oh, yeah, everything's just hunky-dory! What the snuff are you playing at?!"</p>
<p>To which he patiently replied, "Not playing anything!"</p>
<p>Noah: "You're really a mechanic? From Colony 30? Who's the commander for that one again?"</p>
<p>"Ohhh, yeah, that would be me."</p>
<p>The group were surprised. Lanz: "Pull the other one!"</p>
<p>"Woooo{{footnote: Blowing wind without making sound from your throat box out of your mouth}} wow, don't look so surprised!"</p>
<p>Taion recalled, "I did hear that Colony 30's commander was the greatest mechanic in Keves..."</p>
<p>"Not sure I would say <em>'greatest'</em>, but I am bonkers about Levnises!"</p>
<p>As they spoke, <strong>Yuzet</strong> was ringing his iris, shouted to him, "<em>Valdi!</em>"</p>
<p>He turned aside and answered, "Hey, Yuzet! What's up?"</p>
<p>"<em>Surely that's my line?! The Levnis signal just cut out... What happened?!</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh, it just got a bit bashed about. Everything's fine. I'll be back home soon." Then, he cut the line as he finished.</p>
<p>Sena asked, curiously, "You're going back alone?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"I... I was just wondering how you expect to manage that."</p>
<p>"Oh! Oh, it's fine. The Colony's not that far away. I'll just cannibalize these bits and pieces into a new Levnis, quick as you like."</p>
<p>Mio: "That'd take so much salvaging..."</p>
<p>"Oh, huh." After doing some estimation, shook his head, "...Ahahah, maybe I can't do it alone...?" The group just shrugged.</p>
<p>Noah commented, sighed, "...How did I know it would come to this?"</p>
<p>Lanz grudgingly propose to help, putting his hands by the back of his head, "Ehhh... Guess we'll do your grunt work. All right, hit us. What's the shopping list?"</p>
<p>"You'd really help me?!"</p>
<p>"Well, we're not gonna leave you alone to fend for yourself..."</p>
<p>"Thank you so much, large man!"</p>
<p>"Lanz, man... I mean, Lanz."</p>
<p>"Then Lanz I shall call you! Let's get cracking! I'll send the likeliest sites for debris to your Iris."</p>
<hr />
<p>(Arriving at one of the site)</p>
<p>The group was standing by a grassy location, below a tree. Valdi stood at a distance in front of them, inspecting, "Yeah... This is looking good." Then, unsatisfactorily, "But man, even so... Seeing all this Levnis wreckage..." There laid a broken pile of levnis on the grassy floor in front of him.</p>
<p>Mio sympathized, "That's how battle always feels after. Just sad."</p>
<p>"Yeah, pretty tragic. Makes me wanna fix 'em all right back up."</p>
<p>Lanz can't stand it, "Look here, you..."</p>
<p>Valdi turned to face them, continuing, "Listen... I had this injury once. It really did a number on me, physically and mentally. That's when my masterpon told me-"</p>
<p>Lanz interrupted, "Wait, <em>'masterpon'</em>?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it's Nopon for 'really great person'! So anyway, my masterpon told me this: <strong><em>'Be a friend to all, and an enemy of none.'</em></strong>{{footnote: Translator don't know if one agree with this or not without thinking it thoroughly. Edit: Probably, but we don't always have the choice, for we could only control oneself, but not others.}}"</p>
<p>Sena, trying to take in, "Be a friend to all...?"</p>
<p>"Yy-yeah. I guess after that... seeing wrecked Levnises got me thinking about stuff. A little elbow grease and I could just get them back on their feet. My pals here wouldn't want me to give up on them either."</p>
<p>Mio commented, "You're very sweet."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Ahhh, don't get me wrong. It's just that, as a mechanic, you can't start getting moody just because something's broken. <strong><em>'Not all wars are fought on the battlefield'</em></strong>{{footnote: Logically speaking, that's correct. One can't deny.}}, right?"</p>
<p>Riku changed the topic, "That gauntlet... Valdi built it by self?" He was referring to his right hand huge metal arm and fingers.</p>
<p>"This? My masterpon gave this to me. To celebrate my recovery!" Then he continued, "Caught your eye, has it? You wanna see more?"</p>
<p>Riku denied his offer, "No... No special interest."</p>
<p>Tucking his hands on his waist, "C'mon, don't be shy now!"</p>
<p>"Riku is not shy!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "What I'm getting from all this is that you really like this 'masterpon' of yours, huh."</p>
<p>"Yeah. He was really harsh on me sometimes, but he was ten times the mechanic I could ever be!"</p>
<p>Manana wondered, "If compare masterpon and Riku, who is most excellent?"</p>
<p>Valdi couldn't decide, "Hm, good question. I... I think that your friend here has a keen eye. You know, I would love to get to speak with him..."</p>
<p>"Secrets of Riku are closely guarded."</p>
<p>"You don't say! I can't wait!"</p>
<p>"... Friend even listening to Riku?"</p>
<hr />
<p>===</p>
<p>(At another location)</p>
<p>Valdi: "Ah! There! I want the parts from that big guy!"</p>
<p>In the distance, Keves and Agnus levnises plus a few soldiers were fighting each other. In the background, mist covered the tall cylindrical{{footnote: Actually square-ish}} rock that has a tree on top, maybe the same as what we've seen earlier but from an even further distance?</p>
<p>Manana: "Which big guy?"</p>
<p>"The Kevesi... Wait. The damage to the leg here... I fixed this, not long ago. It was from another colony..."</p>
<p>Suddenly, the Kevesi levnis reversed and drove towards the Agnian levnis at high speed, and before it could react, smashed into it, breaking it literally.</p>
<p>"Ahh!" Valdi couldn't believed his eyes, shouted out.</p>
<p>Manana: "This horrible..."</p>
<p>"Augh..." Valdi turned away, didn't want to look how care less the levnis driver was.</p>
<p>"Valdi... OK?"</p>
<p>The levnis was approaching them as Valdi was figuring out, "I get it... So this is how my Levnises have been treated..."</p>
<p>Lanz alerted him calmly, "Sorry to rush you, mate, but we don't have time to be standing around."</p>
<p>He turned to face him, "Huh? What's happening?" Towards the direction he was looking, all we could see were rocky cliff walls, pine-like trees, giant rocks, and grassy lands.</p>
<p>Mio took the time explaining, "Well, we are outlaws, so..."</p>
<p>Noah took over: "They've marked us all as a target."</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Gotta do what you gotta do. Let's get this over with!" They drew their blades and prepared for battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the finished the battle and traveled to yet another location.)</p>
<p>The ground looked metallic, like those inside the ferronis from Colony 4. There were hexagonal prism-shaped chests/boxes placed around the edges. This looks like a barren valley to the translator, light had difficulty penetrating into this location, a narrow valley.</p>
<p>Noah: "What is this place?"</p>
<p>Valdi explained, "It's just where I stored some of the junk I've picked up. Can't keep it all at the colony. You know how it is."</p>
<p>Taion prompted, "I see. So you're recycling the parts as you deem necessary."</p>
<p>"Yeah! The supplies from the Castle just aren't gonna cut it. We have a lot of very particular mechanics, and a lot of requests from the pilots to boot. We even get commissioned to repair the Levnises from other colonies."</p>
<p>Manana: "Seems like awful much effort for not much reward..."</p>
<p>"Not true! We're having a blast with it! Our Nopon are all highly skilled, and our lieutenant has a good head on his shoulders. So, uh... remind me... What was it we were trying to do again?" Finally getting to the main topic.</p>
<p>Lanz impatiently replied, "Picking up parts!"</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah! Right! Well... for the body, I'd need..." He ran towards the boxes, probably containing the scraps, and scanned for something that fits, "Ah! Something like this! Yeah, that fits the bill."</p>
<p>Eunie doubted, hands crossed "Is this guy really cut out to be a commander?"</p>
<p>Mio, standing beside her, "He's a skilled mechanic for sure, but I imagine he gives his aides quite the headache..."</p>
<hr />
<p>(Returning to the original location where the group battled Valdi, after finished salvaging)</p>
<p>"Thanks, guys. Looks like all the parts are accounted for. This is enough to build a Levnis."</p>
<p>Manana noticed he had spoken in a low tone, "What wrong, Valdi? Spirits seem middling to low."</p>
<p>"Hmm... I thought that with a Levnis, I'd be able to protect my friends; That no one would have to get hurt. But... just building them and fixing them up isn't going to make life rosy again. My pals just do as they're ordered. They go out, they fight... and they hurt people. And I'm the one responsible. If you're gonna blame someone for causing all those casualties... blame me."</p>
<p>Riku tried assuring, "Valdi is doing perfectly normal job of mechanic. Issue of orders not your fault."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>Lanz proposed, "This doesn't sit right with you, does it? So make something new. Why d'you always have to make stuff for fighting? Why not try a different tack?"</p>
<p>"A different tack...?" That strikes imaginative sparkles. "Like... a Levnis, but not equipped for combat...?"</p>
<p>"Obviously, I dunno the nitty-gritty, but I'm sure it's not totally off the table, right? This ain't the time to give up! Right?"</p>
<p>"Huh! Yeah! Lanz! You couldn't be more right! I shouldn't be led by the whims of others when I make my sweet little mecha. Thanks, Lanz, and all of you. I'll be back in a jiffy!"</p>
<p>(After some time)</p>
<p>"It's done!" A tiny levnis about the size of Valdi appeared, a mecha-robot, humanoid-like.</p>
<p>Noah was surprised, "Wow. That fast, huh."</p>
<p>Eunie commented, "It's looking a little on the small side, no? Is that... how you wanted it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah! He wouldn't last long in a real battle, but he can follow simple commands. Right now, his only directive is to take care of me. But that's just fine. He's a good guy."</p>
<p>Lanz, perhaps out of patience for progress stagnation{{footnote: Really, one want to call it 'stagnanity', even when that word didn't exist in the Cambridge Online Dictionary.}}, "Right then. Guess our job here's done, so..."</p>
<p>Valdi: "Yeah. Don't worry. I can get back home just fine on my own."</p>
<p>Suddenly Consul <strong>Q</strong>'s voice appeared, "Oh, damn and blast. And I came all this way."</p>
<p>"Huh!" Valdi was shocked with the sloped-head helmet consul appearing. He wore a helmet that resembles probably a head armor like those in the old days, maybe Roman? To the translator, it looked like a KFC sign, for no reason.</p>
<p>Mio: "A Consul!"</p>
<p>"Pleased to make your acquaintance, Ouroboros." Before the group could speak, "Ahhhh, fear not. I have no interest in stirring the pot. I was simply curious as to why our dear Valdi hadn't returned. You promised us you would build the Ultimate Levnis, did you not? How much longer do you expect us to wait? Ahh, you Agnian dogs...{{footnote: It's unsure whether he's referring to Mio and the others, or he thought about Agnian in general.}} How I shall delight in crushing you beneath my boot!"</p>
<p>"About that... Actually, I've decided to-"</p>
<p>Q cut him off, "How many times must I say it? Games are for winning. That's what's matters! Consider. If we were to lose the initiative, <em>we</em> would be the ones trampled beneath <em>their</em> boots!"</p>
<p>"Yes, but..."</p>
<p>Q lost his patience with Valdi's defiance, "Ehhhh...{{footnote: Sucking in air hard, and breathing out hard, a.k.a. deep breath.}} Valdi, my boy... Who was it that said he'd be fine, so long as he could tinker away with Levnises?! Because I clearly remember those words!" As his tone got angrier, he snapped at him, "If you've got time to be flapping those lips, you've got time to be working those hands." The carrot was given, now for the stick, threatening, "Should you fail in your duty, I won't be held accountable for what happens to your <em>friends</em> in the colony..."</p>
<p>Lanz felt insulted, "Snuff you, arsehole! The more that comes out of your gob, the more I wanna smack-"</p>
<p>Valdi cut him off, "Understood. I'm heading back."</p>
<p>"Valdi!"</p>
<p>"Don't worry. I've made up my mind." Then, he followed Consul Q back.</p>
<p>The group gathered together after they left. Sena was thinking, "Ultimate Levnis, he said... I'm a little worried now."</p>
<p>Taion analyzed the situation, "It's unlikely to bode well for us. Ideally, we'd want to prevent it being deployed in battle."</p>
<p>Sena viscerally replied, "Oh yeah, there's that too... But I was more worried about how Valdi feels."</p>
<p>Lanz repeated, "He said he'd made up his mind. Doesn't sound like he's gonna be finishing his ultimate anything to me. More like..."</p>
<p>Riku finished, "He want to destroy it."</p>
<p>Suddenly, the small mecha-robot, whom Valdi left it with the group, ran off into the distance. Lanz was shocked, as well as the others, "Huh?!"</p>
<p>Mio: "It's going off on its own?"</p>
<p>Riku: "It following Valdi. Adhering to directive of 'protect'."</p>
<p>Lanz, asking for instruction what to do next, "Noah..."</p>
<p>"Yeah. We're following it."</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Colony. A large levnis, the Ultimate Levnis, placed with its back facing some cliff walls. There were some bridge/walkways on the "second floor". Valdi stood in front of the Ultimate levnis, inspecting it while Q watched.</p>
<p>"You've wasted time. I'm afraid you'll have to pick up the pace. Because if you can't... Well, you know the stakes. The game will soon resume. We have precious little time."</p>
<p>Behind Q, it was oddly barren, nothing more than floor and ladders and cliff walls. Q, as he finished speaking, turned and walked towards the entrance.</p>
<p>Valdi, caressing one of the Levnis's leg, "If I do as I'm told... You'll... You'll end up hurting so many people. Don't worry." He put his forehead on the leg, "I refuse to put you through that."</p>
<p>He stood back and scanned the surrounding, then gave the Ultimate Levnis one last look. "The next time we meet, I'll make you into the best Levnis there ever was." As he withdrew his weapon to destroy it, Q teleported in front of him.</p>
<p>"So that's the game we're playing, is it now?" With his elbow, he knocked him back, his blade sheathed as he dropped onto the floor. Q walked by his side, kicked him hard in the belly while he was still groaning in pain, "You little upstart!!!"</p>
<p>Then, with a very disappointing sigh, "This is a case of falling in with the wrong crowd, isn't it? I'm very disappointed." Then, he teleported into the control room of the Ultimate Levnis, it started and walked down the maintenance platform it was on.</p>
<p>"Hm... It's about halfway through the projected schedule... But this will have to do." The Levnis had quite short legs and small torso, compared to the width of its shoulders and arms{{footnote: Like a buff guy whom trained only the upper torso but left out the lower ones.}}, equipped with grips. It walked towards Valdi slowly.</p>
<p>Valdi, still laying flat on the ground, tilted his head up at the Levnis, "What are you gonna do?"</p>
<p>"I will have it achieve its intended purpose. But, first of all... I believe you need a little... discipline." With the grip, he punched towards Valdi, he closed his eyes and prepared for his death.</p>
<p>Upon hearing a metallic sound smashing against each other, feeling not hurt, Valdi looked up. The small mecha-robot raised a frequency shield in front of him.</p>
<p>"Wait a sec..."</p>
<p>Q was surprised too, "Excuse me? What is this junk? Move aside!" He  landed a dozens of punches as he spoke. As the shield got zeroed, the mecha robot flew aside, electric sparkles on its joints as it stood up slowly.</p>
<p>Valdi shouted at it, "Stop it! Just stop."</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn't program that feature. It ran towards Valdi, kicked him aside and blocked yet another punch from the Ultimate Levnis.</p>
<p>"You've done enough. I never wanted this." Sorrow filled the climate as its joints dislocated suffering blows. "You weren't supposed to protect me like this..." Finally, its leg joints broke down, collapsing on the floor.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Worthless drivel!" Q kicked it aside. Valdi was preparing to ran up to it when Lanz appeared from behind, lending him a helping hand.</p>
<p>"Lanz?! But how?"</p>
<p>The group had drawn their blades and stood between him and the Ultimate Levnis.</p>
<p>"Thank your little pal here." Valdi looked at the mecha-robot, with only one hand and one leg attached.</p>
<p>Sena: "Your buddy led us all the way to you!"</p>
<p>As it still tried to reach towards its broken leg between it and the Ultimate Levnis, Q got angry, ignoring the group and focused on it, "Glorified tin opener! You dare attack me?!" He raised the Ultimate Levnis's leg on top of it.</p>
<p>Valdi broke off Lanz's hand and ran towards the mecha robot, tears flying backwards, hands held out, "Don't do it! Please, stop!!!"{{footnote: Also, the direction he ran to had the ferronis, seemingly incorporated <em>into</em> the cliff body??? Maybe because of the angle.}}</p>
<p>Too late! Q stepped on the mecha-robot, smoke enshrouded its legs. Raising it revealed dislocated parts on the sooty ground. Valdi collapsed onto the floor in vain hope.</p>
<p>Q enjoyed his reaction with his annoyance destroyed, laughing hard, "Wahahahahhahaha! Any tool that defies the orders of its master is trash! Destined for the scrapyard!"</p>
<p>Valdi rebutted in tears, "It's not trash! Levnises have always, <em>always</em> protected the things I care about. I'm so small and pathetic. But, they taught me that... that I'm worth something." As he climbed on his feet, "That's why I chose to be a mechanic. Not this..." Facing Q, "Not for something as sad as this!"</p>
<p>"Why should you care about a hunk of metal? Hahahaha" The group ran beside him to face Q, as he continued, "If you oppose me, I'll do away with you -- full stop!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Quit your yapping and let's get scrapping!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(After destroying the Ultimate Levnis.)</p>
<p>Q got out of the control room, puffing out smoke, "Nghh... Useless piece of junk! Forget it. A Consul needs no crutch to lean on! "</p>
<p>As he spoke, the levnis exploded to his surprise, "Aaargh...!" He was nowhere to be seen, maybe dead, but probably teleported away since there weren't any corpses.</p>
<p>Valdi looked back at the broken mecha-robot, without the Consul disturbing them, "Ahh, I'm sorry! I... I couldn't do anything..."</p>
<p>Lanz rebutted, "I wouldn't say that. At the very least, this little guy got to live the way you wanted him to."</p>
<p>"... Well, I sure hope so. Thanks. For rescuing me." By now, we could see two transporting levnis had been parked behind the group, don't know when it appeared. Turning back to the mecha-robot, "Next time, I'll be sure to give you a tougher body, Mechafriend."</p>
<p>"Mechafriend?"</p>
<p>"Gotta have a name, right? This little guy isn't meant for battle. He's a fellow companion... and a friend. So yeah. Thanks, guys! I'm not going to focus my efforts just on repairing Levnises any more. I'll be working hard to figure out the best way to protect us all - in the truest sense! Oh, but, uh... I guess that'd mean doing something about all our Flame Clocks, huh..."</p>
<p>Noah took over, "About that... We could always smash Colony 30's Flame Clock? It'd mean that everyone in the colony wouldn't have to fight any more. The Levnises too." Behind him, there was some staircase leading to the second floor. Seemingly, this colony was built with 3 sides bordering the cliff wall.</p>
<p>"You can do that?!"</p>
<p>"We can. I can't guarantee that things will go smoothly for you after, though... "</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say things are going particularly great as they stand anyway. If I can make a difference for people, and not just Levnises... Let's do it. Let's make this happen!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As Mio and Noah looked at the Ferronis that seemed to had its body behind some cliff wall, or atop it, one don't know; Noah shouted, "Here we go!" and they transformed into Ouroboros, dashing towards the Flame Clock, jumped, cancelled the Interlink mid-air, as Noah slashed the Flame Clock himself{{footnote: Mio was behind him, probably landed before him.}}. The half-filled gauge spilled out "lives" like a cut arteries, half of the Flame Clock dislodged,  dropped onto the ground below by the pull of gravity, emitting soot and smoke as it crashed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Valdi, looking at the Flame Clock, was amazed, "It really broke..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Hey, you OK there?"</p>
<p>Suddenly getting into a defensive posture, "Wait, don't move a muscle! There might be some valuable materials lying around!"</p>
<p>Eunie shook her head, "Nothing worth bothering about, believe me..."</p>
<p>Lanz prompted, "How are you feeling? It's gotta sting, right? It was a big deal for you."</p>
<p>"Lanz, you seem more stung than me."</p>
<p>"Come on, man, no."</p>
<p>"I'm fine. I mean, sure, it's a big change of perspective. But like I said before, I'd already made up my mind."</p>
<p>"True that."</p>
<p>"Heh! Hey, um... Could I help you guys with your mission, in return? It'd be the least I could do."</p>
<p>Riku asked, "Valdi realize what Valdi saying?"</p>
<p>"I've never been more sure!"</p>
<p>Manana excitedly agreed, "For sure!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Thank you. We appreciate it."</p>
<p>Mio added, "Looking forward to it!"</p>
<p>Valdi joined, "Haha, me too. Count me in!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> By a lakeside, some gray{{footnote: Seen only in daylight scene, second video}} krabble gathered by the barren rocky side of the bank. On the opposite grassy side, there were some platforms arranged in steps. A cyan-white long snake-like dragon slithered through the air. In the distance, we could see mountains and even higher platforms, trees grew more plentifully. Another scene, icy-top mountains lay in the background. We could see some lake/river below the camera, some red-mane wolves occupied and resting on an elevated platform adjacent to the bank. A single tree full of red leaves stood out in the distance. Trees are more broad like Africa's Yellowwood (a tall bark without any branches except at the very top) rather than purely pine, though both existed. Yet another scene, by a river. An animal with a light attached to its head, like a lantern, strodding beside a river. We could also see some rhinoceros-like animals, armu, grazing in the meadow on the same side of the bank. At the edge of the river, there were deserts occupied trees with leaves arranged in a fan-shape, and something that looked like a Kevesi ferronis or ruins, half covered, to the left of the desert. This, is <strong>Rae-Bel Tableland</strong>, of Fornis Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As the group tramped on the grass fields near a gushing river, they saw some of the armu grazing in the distance. The red-leaf tree was seen far away, at the other side of the river. The group paused their steps, as Noah and Mio stopped side by side, Taion and the others was somewhere further away from them, chatting.</p>
<p>Noah examined the armu group, commented, "That's funny. I'd never noticed that before..."</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "Oh, do they... not have Armus where you're from?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... I meant 'getting old'. Is that what that is?" There was a baby armu on the left, grazing. A larger armu in the middle, its back grew a hardened skin, armor-like, with short horns, also grazing. The oldest stood to the right, fully grown horns and head plates and back plates, rough leg skins, <em>also</em> grazing.</p>
<p>They were reminded by the wrinkles on Guernica. "<em>It's called getting old, this.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah continued, "That smaller Armu over there. It starts little, but grows over time. Becomes like the bigger one. All the creatures do it... But we never change that much.{{footnote: 10 years old to 20 years old doesn't change much? BTW, 10 years old is just one's estimate, it may be 12 years old to 22 years old, one don't know.}}"</p>
<p>Mio's eyebrows raised up, "Huh..."</p>
<p>"It's such a basic fact. So why haven't we realized it before...?" She turned to look at him, before turning back and enjoy the view of the armus.</p>
<p>This scene was watched in the projector room by the moebius, particularly, the moebius with the X on his chest, wearing a mask rather than a helmet. The golden mask covered half of his face above his nose. As if replying to Noah, "Realization leads to hope... Which in due time turns to despair. The significance of the stasis, is driven ever deeper within... "</p>
<p>A moebius that looked like a bird nose pointed downwards, like a medieval Roman Armor head plate, commented, "A moment in time. A sublime experience. That brilliance, it shines ascendant over all else."</p>
<p>A female moebius with a butterfly mask over her eyes, wearing a helmet, "That's why it takes so much frickin' work. Working stinks..."</p>
<p>Z, with purple dendrites-like shape stretching from the tip of his lips, white hair, red iris "They all learn sooner or later. They learn how priceless it was, how grossly irreplaceable. The 'Eclipse'{{footnote: Homecoming events were done during the Eclipse.}} grows near..." The moebius sign appeared on his right iris, triggering the moebius sign on the other moebius' (both) irises, except for the golden mask X guy, with only his right iris glowing. The projector focused on Mio's term symbol.</p>
<p>Back to the scene,  Mio's term symbol only had the center dot remaining{{footnote: As we mentioned before.}}. Mio spoke out, "They get along nice... Must be good friends."</p>
<p>Noah: "It's funny. Just looking at these guys... It puts your mind at ease."</p>
<p>"Mhm!" Mio nodded, agreed.</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Is it... an effect of becoming Ouroboros?"</p>
<p>"Good question. Still, I think I could... get used to this." She thought for a while, their situations irrevocable.</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Yeah... Me too."{{footnote: It wasn't sure if they means the same 'this', Noah probably means getting old, but one thinks Mio not. One could also consider 'this' being the situation they're in, the life they lived.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group tramped down the grassy surface to the left of the red-leaves tree, whom grew with its bark by a rocky platform. Taion, penultimate on the line, stopped and glanced at it. Others in front didn't notice his absence. Noah stopped after he surpassed him, seeing he didn't follow up.</p>
<p>Taion took step towards the red-leaves tree, Noah following behind. The evening sun caressed the leaves, glittered as it reflected off its surface.</p>
<p>"Did you find something?" Noah sounded from behind.</p>
<p>"Hm? No..." Surprised that someone followed him, he spoke in a low tone, "Just brings me back a bit... It reminded me of someone."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Noah was eager to know.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="start-of-taions-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-taions-memories">(Start of Taion's Memories)</a></h4>
<p>Young Taion, inside an Agnian camp with Nimue, looking at a picture with pitch dark walls of unknown material. Red leaves covered quite a lot of its surface. At the very end (or the very top){{footnote: Author couldn't recognize the perspective of the picture.}}, a hole with blue sky and white clouds. He asked Nimue, "What is this?"</p>
<p>"A <strong>Saffronia</strong>." Nimue sounded from in front.</p>
<p>"I know that. But, I've never seen one in such full bloom before."</p>
<p>"Heh. It's special."</p>
<p>"Huh... So, why give this to me?"</p>
<p>"It's a treasure of mine." She glanced away, reminisced nostalgically, "I'd like to go back someday. To where this was taken... It's a dream I have..."</p>
<p>As Taion looked at her reaction, glancing back at the photo, she brought out her stopwatch gadget. Nimue opened it up to look at it, "Not that I have all that much time to spare." Her term symbol, on her left arm, showed the central dot and half of the central diamond red. She grabbed it into her fist and putting it to her chest, lowering her head and closing her eyes, as if to bring her back where she wanted to go in the moment, "But soon..."</p>
<p>Taion watched her reactions in silence.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-taions-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-taions-memories">(End of Taion's Memories)</a></h4>
<hr />
<p>He sighed, "She was the one who taught me strategy... Who taught me how to fight using the Mondo." The Mondo appeared in front of him, danced in front of him before floating sideway out of the scene. They glanced at it as Taion spoke.</p>
<p>"Sorry..." Perhaps he apologized for having someone to share his worries.</p>
<p>To which Noah replied, "Not to worry..."</p>
<p>"But why...? Why did she show me that picture...?" He looked down, still curious, perhaps with some regret.</p>
<p>Walking in front of him, Noah, glancing at the Saffronia, suggested, "I suppose she wanted to share it with you. The memory."</p>
<p>"Is that... why she..."</p>
<p>"You know... It's not unheard of."</p>
<p>"Huh?" He wasn't sure what he meant.</p>
<p>He turned, tap Taion's right shoulder lightly as he walked off towards where the group was, Taion followed with his sight. Only he had the answers to his own questions. The ground below the Saffronia bloomed with orange flowers, traced its path towards the dirt road in the distance. The front group <em>still</em> hadn't notice the two guys missing far behind. Turning and taking a final look at the Saffronia, he followed thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Someone watched the group traversed from his/her iris. It was Isurd, inside an Agnian camp, perhaps in Colony Lambda's headquarters.</p>
<p>"These soldiers... Taion?!" He turned off his iris, turning his attention to the joker helmet consul, asked, "These are your targets... sir?"</p>
<p>The joker face bounced side to side as he walked, closing their distance, and put his hands behind his necks, looking up at Isurd (since his head as in line with Isurd's lower torso) "Yep. You'll handle it, right?"</p>
<p>"And it's... because they're consorting with enemy soldiers? If that's so, shouldn't we question them first?"</p>
<p>The consul, putting his hands down, sighed, "Ugh, you're a hell of a stickler, aren't you? I <em>could</em> just go and do it the K way..." The moebius sign glowed in his right iris. Both of Isurd's cornea lose its light, left iris glowed in red like that of Ethel previously.</p>
<p>That was just a while before he gave up, the moebius symbol lose its light. "Ugh... forget it." He turned to his back and walked some distance, as Isurd came back to life. "There's just no zest. This time, I'm gonna take a different angle."</p>
<p>Isurd, unsure of what had happened, spoke out, "C-Consul...?"</p>
<p>The consul turned to face Isurd, "Heh. Let's do this, Isurd." He squatted, hands hugging himself, as if a ball of energy was suppressed within. Dark energy released to its surrounding shook the floor. Isurd, confounded, backed up into a defensive posture.</p>
<p>"Go on, spill it for me... Gimme all you're feeling, deep inside!" As he finished, he opened his arms, as if to embrace, the ball of energy shone so bright that Isurd had to block his face to prevent blinded by it. The bright light engulfed the whole tent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Approaching an old battlefield. Ruins laid on the barren sooty ground, itself surrounded by higher platforms. Wind blew hard on the surface of the battlefield. Icy mountains could be seen beyond the distance. Kevesi corpses, levnises shards, filled all over the place. The atmosphere was foreboding. Noah commented as they stopped, "This is awful..."</p>
<p>Mio, to his 4 o'clock, added, "It doesn't look recent. Been here a while. And the battle, it must've been massive." Some fragments, seemingly ferronis shards, rusty and half buried in the ground.</p>
<p>Taion: "It's not just infantry. I see Ferronis wreckage strewn all over."</p>
<p>Lanz thought forward, "There could be stuff here we can reuse. We should look."</p>
<p>To which Noah agreed, "Yeah, good idea. Let's split up and have a look around." They split individually in different directions.</p>
<p>Disagreeing with Lanz after she left, Eunie strodded as she scanned her vicinity, levnises wreckages beside where she walked "'Stuff we can reuse', my wings... All this junk is rusted through..."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Something shiny and looking new on the ground caught her attention. She squatted to pick it up. It was a circular object. As she stood back up, sighed with disappointment, "Ugh, no love. The connector's the wrong size..." She threw it on the floor, turning her attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>Somewhere in the distance where she threw it caught her attention. Beside some ferronis and levnis wreckages, a silhouette figure seemingly down on the floor{{footnote: Bent down? Knelt down? Sat down? One don't know.}}. She approached the figurine, whom had a neck-long hair, with wings like that of Eunie. "This one's Kevesi... You've been here for... quite a while..."</p>
<p>She bent down, looking at a dog tag attached to its shirt. She removed it onto her hands, scanned it with her iris to decipher it:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Name: Eunie<br />
Affiliation: Colony 18<br />
Class: Sharpshooter</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She was confounded. Her iris constricted as she questioned herself, horrified, "Wha-what is this-?! Wh-why is my name on here?!" As if taken back by some unbeknownst memories...</p>
<h4 id="start-of-eunies-recallfootnote-a-recall-is-a-piece-of-memory-from-before-your-current-reincarnation"><a class="header" href="#start-of-eunies-recallfootnote-a-recall-is-a-piece-of-memory-from-before-your-current-reincarnation">(Start of Eunie's Recall{{footnote: A recall is a piece of memory from before your current reincarnation.}})</a></h4>
<p>Kevesi soldiers, holding their weapons, marched through the battlefield, their ferronis following behind. A moebius high up in the air released its shots like feathers shooting in all directions, blasting the floor inches by inches, soldiers laid down as dirt enshrouded the air. Struggling to stand up between levnises ruins, flames burning, the triangular head moebius stared at her with its leopard-like sharp purple eyes, showing her its sharp canines. Trembling in agony, she effetely watched its glowing fingernails brought closer to her forehead.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-eunies-recall"><a class="header" href="#end-of-eunies-recall">(End of Eunie's Recall)</a></h4>
<p>Imagined how you breathed vigorously, woken up by a haunting nightmare.</p>
<p>"Eunie... Eunie!" At first, she heard a blurry voice calling out for her, on second tone, her brain registered it was Lanz, gasping as her head rebounced. Looking at her back, his hands around his waist, inspectingly asked, "Did you find anything worthwhile?"</p>
<p>"Huh?!" She slightly turned her head, looking to him from the tip of her eyes. She partially tuned in as most of her conscious and unconscious lingered on the recall.</p>
<p>Lanz repeated, "I said, didja find anything we might be able to salvage?"</p>
<p>Tremblingly, she replied, "N-nope! Nothing at all... Not here."</p>
<p>"Seriously? You were here all frozen, so I figured you must've struck something gold..." He turned and walked away into the distance, didn't prod deeper. Having no one to disturb her, she continued to sort her feelings. Lanz approached a piece of levnis scraps as he turned to her, nudging, "C'mon, help me shift this thing here, wouldja?"</p>
<p>Unconsciously, she stood up, turning to him, "Y-yeah, all right!" As he squatted to find a place where he could lay his hands, Eunie walked to him halfway before stopping, turning back to glance at the figurine, as if trying to see herself mirrored. As the atmosphere became heavier, she turned away to dissuade herself, "Uh-uh... No way that was me." She turned down to look at the dog tag, still holding in her palm, "Just... someone with the same name as me... A coincidence..." Then, she walked towards Lanz, as if nothing had happened. The figurine seemingly glanced in her direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena and Manana were squatting, doing nothing, as they heard Noah shouting, "Hey! Over here!"</p>
<p>As the group gathered around him, Mio seemingly recognized it: "Uh... it's...A golden Flame Clock... But wrecked. I've never seen one."</p>
<p>Taion exclaimed, "A real golden Flame Clock."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ain't that strange? We're talkin' Gold rank -- the shiny pinnacle of every Colony's ambition. And this is how we find it?"</p>
<p>Eunie, seemingly calmed temporarily, crossed her arms, commented as she inspected the clock, "It's, uh... Kevesi, isn't it?"</p>
<p>To which Noah affirmed: "Yeah. Has to be."</p>
<p>Taion looked back at the battlefield behind, "For all that, I'm not seeing any Agnian corpses or weapons. What does it mean?"</p>
<p>Noah didn't understood either, "Sparks... How could they have ended up this way...?"</p>
<p>While they were thinking, the ground shook. The group turned to its core, back facing the Flame Clock, with Eunie complaining, "Aw, come on. Not a-sparkin'-gain?!"</p>
<p>An Agnian levnis with four arms, humanoid structure, and a long pike on its head, drilled its way up, opening up once it floated mid-air, facing the group as it shook away dirt on its body. The group summoned their weapons, prepared for a fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the battle)</p>
<p>Lanz commented, "What a faff, just one stray Levnis? Barely worth the effort..."</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "Yeah... Doesn't seem to be what did this Colony in."</p>
<p>Taion seemed to have joined some dots, "I see... It was revenge...? Commander, you did it..."</p>
<p>Lanz continued, "So this... works on its own?"</p>
<p>To which Taion replied, "Yes. That's a standard Castle-issue autonomous sentry Levnis. It doesn't need human operators." All non-Nopon turned to face Taion, except for Eunie, whom was still stuck in her thoughts, and Mio, whom walked up to the Levnis, caught by a symbol encarved.</p>
<p>She looked at the symbol engraved on the levnis's plate, asked, "Hey, this symbol... It's Lambda's, right?" She turned to Taion.</p>
<p>Sena was triggered, turned to him, "Huh? Taion, weren't you with-"</p>
<p>As if something painful triggered his memory. He didn't reply them, instead suggested, "Ahh... We need to get away from here. Though it was unmanned, it's sure to have transmitted its combat data to the Colony. They might even be able to work out we're the ones it was fighting."</p>
<p>Lanz saw the logic, "Right... Well, don't reckon there's anything more of use here. Let's go, Noah."</p>
<p>"Gotcha." He nodded.</p>
<p>They moved in front of Eunie, her head lowered as she was still caught in her thought, frozen in her place. Noah called out, "Mio?"</p>
<p>"Mm" She nodded, looked at Sena, whom nodded, and followed.</p>
<p>Taion, the penultimate to leave, turned to find Eunie frozen. She had been holding her wobbling breathe all this time, breathed it out as the group leave. She put her right palm on her left fist, pushing it down as it shudders uncontrollably, perhaps holding the dog tag. "Eunie...?" He watched and called out softly, but didn't disturb her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Leaving the battlefield behind, the group continued on a paved road with grass growing beside. Taion, noticing Eunie's low mood, called out, "Everybody, listen up." As everyone turned to him, he continued, "We've entered Colony Lambda's territory. That means that the probability of our encountering Agnus forces is very high. Before we get any closer to their patrolled zone, we should prepare ourselves by resting."</p>
<p>Noah turned to everyone, whom had "no objections here."</p>
<p>And Mio added, "Or here. Let's go with Taion's plan!" They headed for a lit fireplace just up ahead.</p>
<hr />
<p>Night falls. Mio slept between Riku and Manana on the same sleeping bag. Eunie laid down her sleeping bag besides the bonfire, sitting up and looking at it. Taion was busy making tea; Sena and Lanz performed maintenance on their weapons; Noah, practicing his slashing skills. Eunie's eyelids gradually closed as she felt drowsy.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-eunies-recall"><a class="header" href="#start-of-eunies-recall">(Start of Eunie's Recall)</a></h4>
<p>They were running in a direction, the ferronis followed behind. Levnises and guns fired shots at distant barriers (giant rocks), clearing a path. Suddenly, a soldier to Eunie's 1 o'clock groaned in pain and fell to the ground. There was a giant blast in that direction that shook her off balance. The blast released a cloud of dust and smoke into the air.</p>
<p>A moebius darted out from behind the dust in to mid-air. As Eunie looked up, awed, it shot fiery purple-red shots in all direction, blasting the ground inch by inch. Nothing hit her. As she struggled to stand up, the dust cleared to reveal fallen soldiers, their 'lives' escaping their corpses.</p>
<p>Gasping, the moebius smashed into the ground to her 11 o'clock, didn't gave her a chance to accept her fate. It darted towards the ferronis, dragging its arms on its side with its glowing yellow fingernails attached to the end of its limbs{{footnote: Note, this is stupid, because if you dart, you want to reduce drag, so don't follow this stupid posture in real life.}}, slicing down levnises and soldiers that stood on its way. Eunie, confounded, retreated her steps effetely as she watched the levnises exploded, corpses flew mid-air, smoke engulfed the distance while flames seared.</p>
<p>The ferronis still move forward. As she turned to it, energy balls blasted its neck area, detaching its neck (and its Flame Clock) from its torso. She backed up into a defensive posture, pointing her rifle at the ferronis; the flame-engulfed torso came tumbling down with the moebius hanging on it.</p>
<p>As dust cleared, she found herself buried below some wreckages, looking at flames and 'lives' evaporating through a hole in front of her. As she climbed out of the flame-raging levnises' shards, coughing out the thick smoke that deprived the surrounding of fresh air, she struggled and stood up, limply taking steps forward.</p>
<p>Pomp! The moebius landed in front of her. She stood frozen, looking at the monster's face that brought agony to their colony. Effetely, her feet loses the energy to carry her weight, she stumped forward and knelt-sitting on the ground. The moebius squatted to glean at her with its triangular face, sharp teeth, at bat-like ears. It showed her the sharpness of its fingernails, turned and pointed it at her forehead, which slowly closed in and moved to point at her right iris. With trembling breathe, it was brought about 5 mm from the retina, as...</p>
<h4 id="end-of-eunies-recall-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-eunies-recall-1">(End of Eunie's Recall)</a></h4>
<p>Eunie, her head drooped in a sitting position, bounced up as she woke from her nightmare, gasping for air. Nobody seemed to notice her reaction. As she stopped gasping, the sounds of burning firewood filled the serene atmosphere. She looked down, holding her chilling left arm up, shuddering. While she struggled to clench it into a fist, a hand holding a cup appeared on the left of her vision. Surprised, she turned to find Taion holding out a cup of tea he made for her.</p>
<p>"Oh, thank you..." She received the cup with both her wobbly arms. Water vapor floated off the dark-colored tea, warming her hands. She took a sip from it while Taion sat beside her, also taking a sip from his cup. When one took a sip from tea, one is obliged to breathe it out, like how cigarette-smoking people breathe out smoke from their mouth. What breathed out with tea isn't smoke, but the heavy burden that pressed on one's heart; and in this case, on Eunie's chest, as she commented, "Smells good."</p>
<p>Perhaps he struggled to incorporate emotions into words, explained it away with the tea's description. "Obviously. It's a Sirius Anemone. A rare flower from the Urayan mountains, crushed and extracted."</p>
<p>"Wow, look at you. Sounds like a hobby." As she took another sip from it, she carelessly replied, her attention diverted to focus on him than her nightmare.</p>
<p>Taion, flattered, "Hmph... And a practical one, at that."</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>As she looked at him, he glanced over the tip of his eyes at her hands and the cup she held, continued, "Like I said... practical... Glad it worked." She turned to look at her cup as she listened to him.</p>
<p>Surprised, she turned towards him, "Ah! You noticed?"</p>
<p>He continued, his eyes looking away from hers, "I did. Mine do that too."</p>
<p>"Uh?" Perhaps she was confused, perhaps curious.</p>
<p>"I put down my weapon, look around at my companions, and feel relief.Thinking 'finally, another day down'." Lanz and Sena now practiced bashing, as Taion continued, "<strong><em>Then I think of tomorrow and the tremors are back. Will I see the same faces when I wake...? Will I even be around to see them...?</em></strong> Hah." Mio turned, torso facing upwards, as he{{footnote: Of course, referring to Taion.}} spoke.</p>
<p>"Easy with the mark, I s'pose. You know when it's coming. But when you're in a scrap..."</p>
<p>"Can you really speak for them, though? For someone nearing the end?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Because I couldn't tell you. All we can possibly do is wonder what it's like. What can one feel? Contentment, perhaps...? Or sheer horror...?"</p>
<p>"I'd really hope it's... not fear."</p>
<p>"Me too." He looked down at his term symbol on his palm, central circle and central triangle red. As he stood up, "That's just it..." He and Eunie turned their attention to the sleeping Mio on their left, the only tenth term amongst them.</p>
<hr />
<p>The bonfire was now a pile of ashes. Irregular mountains lurked in the distance, blurry. The path leads up a slope. Trees and grass and flower bushes grew by the side of the road, with short elevated platforms occasionally. The group gathered in a circle somewhere further from the bonfire, checking their iris.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't we just hoof it and blitz through as quick as we can?" Lanz suggested, plotting a route from their current location through the main path, to another location.{{footnote: The translator could make nothing else, where the colony was located, nor any other features, from the given map.}}</p>
<p>Eunie disagreed, "Nah, I reckon we ought to avoid spots where those Moebius sickos could get the jump on us."</p>
<p>"Unless I'm mistaken..." Taion commented, "This region is under the control of Lambda. That is the Colony I originally belonged to."</p>
<p>"You don't say!" Noah was surprised, deactivating his iris as he turned towards Taion. The others followed.</p>
<p>Mio prompted, "Then... The Levnis yesterday...?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. It was Colony Lambda's. Definitely."</p>
<p>Sena, lowering her head, and looking up from the top of her eyes, as if inquiring, careful not to struck any chord, "Isn't that... Isn't that bad for us?"</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Taion looked down, unsure how to reply. Eunie changed the topic, asking, "All right, so you know this area?"</p>
<p>"I took part in... seizing this area."</p>
<p>Mio: "All right then. Any suggestions?"</p>
<p>"Oh, er..." As he was lingering in his memories, his attention span was cut short, unable to reply.</p>
<p>Mio urged, "Come on."</p>
<p>With unstable voice, he activated his iris, plotting another sinusoidal-shaped path to the right of the main path, "L-Let's see... There should be some nearby tunnels we could use." The others checked their iris as he transferred the data to them.</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Sounds good to me. We might still get enemies, but underground, at least we won't have to worry about lunking Ferronises and that."</p>
<p>Riki eyes shone, together with Manana's, "Tunnels! Thrill of explore! Riku already on treasure-scent!"</p>
<p>"Ohohohoho!" Manana laughed with agreement, flapping her wings as she danced up and down.</p>
<p>Noah turned to him, "Seems like that's the way to go then."</p>
<p>Taion quickly rejected, stuttering, "Uh...O-One moment. These tunnels have been disused for a long time. There's a very real risk of a cave-in. If it comes down to it, escape options may also be in short supply..."</p>
<p>Lanz was as optimistic as usual, "Nah, nah, nah. You're the one who came out with it. Unless, you got any other plans? You better not want us to just camp out here forever."</p>
<p>"No, obviously..."</p>
<p>Mio didn't like the negativity and inability of deciding, rounding the situation up, "All right, let's back it up! Any route we can take will have some attendant risk or other. At this point, I'll settle for any choice that makes our lives easier. Enough with the doom-mongering. Just keep it positive. Things'll work out somehow." Her hands crossed across her chest.</p>
<p>"Mimi, what's up with you?" Sena hadn't seen her in such serious tone.{{footnote: One isn't sure if one should add a 'before' or 'in a long time' to the back, for one don't have their memory, so we'll leave it cut short there.}}</p>
<p>Eunie teased, putting her hands behind her neck, "Sounds like little Miss Senior's decided to pull rank, eh?" Then, with a deeper voice, "Roger that, ma'am!"</p>
<p>Mio was serious with it, "Oh, shut up already."</p>
<p>Noah made the final decision, "Right. Let's go. We'll check out those tunnels." He took the lead towards the tunnels.</p>
<p>"Hey! Wait for me!" Mio shouted after him as she ran to walk beside him. The others followed behind without objections.</p>
<hr />
<p>As they made their way up a slope, Eunie was speaking to Noah, Manana with Mio (and Riku beside her). The road was barren, composed of dark soil in total, surrounded by cliffs (they're in a valley, probably). Taion and Lanz, walking at the end, with Taion starting a conversation with Lanz.</p>
<p>"I envy you."</p>
<p>"Whuh?" He turned to him as they kept on with their steps.</p>
<p>"That unfounded confidence of yours. I almost wish I could take some."</p>
<p>"I'd rather do something than sit farting about for hours, and then do nothing anyway. I like my way better."</p>
<p>"That sounded rather pointed."</p>
<p>"Oh, did it?" He looked up at the sky. After a few steps of silence, he continued, "Anyway, I'm not confident. I just... have to keep moving. That's all."</p>
<p>"I don't get you."</p>
<p>Turning the topic on Taion, "I mean yourself, why d'you always take a back seat?"</p>
<p>"Whuh?"</p>
<p>"You scared?"</p>
<p>"Uh-huh..." He probably agreed with it, looking low.</p>
<p>Hearing no reply from him, Lanz continued, "Noah, he... He likes to say, 'Don't blame yourself'. He knows why I can't stay still, and he gets it, all right. Tells me it's not healthy, yeah?" Then, with a very low tone, reminiscing about Joran, "But it's easier said. Anyhow, not like I can just wish him back. I mean, what else can I do?" Then, continued with his advice, "S'how it goes. Same deal with you, right?"</p>
<p>"Ur, uh..." He probably don't understand the head and tails of the story, nor did he knows how to reply.</p>
<p>Lanz didn't expect an answer from him anyways, in an enthusiastic tone, "Eh, to be fair... That whole prudent schtick of yours? Got its merits!"</p>
<p>Taion rebutted, "Bu-... That's the opposite of what you said before."</p>
<p>"I guess I'm taking it back, then! Bahahahaha!" To which Taion just shook his head. Though, it did make Taion calm down somewhat.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Tunnel ceilings supported by metal beams from collapsing. Caterpillars{{footnote: One knew this later.}} with glowing green spikes on its back, roamed the ground; while copper winged bats roamed the air. Another scene. An island platform with grass, tress growing on the bottom side of it, had an entrance/exit. Krabbles crawled on the platform. In the distance, stingray-like Laia romaed the "cloud sea". A beam shoned from above illuminates the undulating misty clouds. Some crystals, like frozen ice, hung from the ceiling. Yet another scene. Spider webs filled the area, sticking themselves to stone pillars and walls. There were some metal fence in the distance. Finally, an unending tunnel with metal support every fixed distance; the walls had glowing specks of blue. This, is <strong>Urayan Tunnels</strong>, in the Pentelas Region.</p>

<p>Entering the tunnel. The slopes lead to a lift in the distance, which took the central stage. Two green-spikes caterpillars lurked in front of the lift. Standing on the top of the slope, Noah turned to the group and warned, "We don't know what lies ahead, so let's go carefully."</p>
<p>Taion agreed, "Indeed. I want to be out of here as fast as possible, but haste can only spell trouble."</p>
<p>Riku step ahead and scanned the area, commented, "This place rich in ore and gemstone! Speed is of essence! All treasure will belong to Riku!"</p>
<p>Manana: "Oho? Riku seem mighty excitey."</p>
<p>Riku changed into a serious looking face before he turned towards Manana and the others, explained, "... Gemstone have many use. They probably useful later to us."</p>
<p>"Riku sound unusually enthused. Took to be cool and brooding type."</p>
<p>Riku, scratching his head (or rather, hairs), "... It something of a hobby."</p>
<p>"Ohhhh... hobby of Manana is cooking!"</p>
<p>"Riku well aware..."</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Riku, if we find any nice gemstones, should we bring them to you?"</p>
<p>"If friends get chance, then please. Gemstone with good potential will be good investment for future."</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't too optimistic, "I don't think we're just gonna happen across priceless gemstones, but OK."{{footnote: If you look behind the scene with the first video, you could see a character that was never introduced. That person actually could be anybody, because in game, there's a 7th slot for a hero like Ethel or Cammuravi to join in and appear in scene, but they never spoke or do anything out of the common, so we'll omit them in the future unless they participated. And by the way, that hero was actually <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Teach" target="_blank">Teach</a>.}}</p>
<p>"Nopon very pacifistic and don't fight, but would hate not to lend support."</p>
<p>"If Manana fight, that mean Manana not become burden?"</p>
<p>Eunie disrupted her from classifying herself as burdening, "Don't you worry about things like that. Everyone has their bit to do."</p>
<p>"If Manana could Interlink, Manana surely to be of good use."</p>
<p>Riku: "If we could do such thing, would have done ages ago..."</p>
<p>Noah cut the conversation short, "Right. Anyway, getting out of these tunnels is the main priority. But let's keep an eye out for any ore along the way. We can't afford to overlook anything that might help us later."</p>
<p>Riku agreed, "Understood. That good enough."</p>
<p>Lanz grudgingly, lazily replied, putting his hands behind his head, "Yeaaaah, go on. I'll give you a hand."</p>
<p>Riku was surprised. "Even Lanz? That turn up for the books..."</p>
<p>"Always good to have a few favors to call in, yeah?"</p>
<p>"...Riku knew it."</p>
<hr />
<p>(As they approached the lift)</p>
<p>Sena clicked on the button that calls the elevator. The light on the panel turned red. "Hmm, doesn't look like it's working, guys."</p>
<p>Riku approached the panel and inspected for its cause, commented,  "It need electricity. But if no ether cylinder, no electricity."</p>
<p>Mio suggested, "Let's have a look around, shall we?"</p>
<p>Taion agreed, "That sounds like a plan."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the lift control room. A grid window panes filled the side of the wall facing the cave. Control panels were installed on all sides of the room. Noah installed an ether cylinder into the accepting slot. Then, Taion switch power on on another panel. As power returns, (cave) lights at the lower area of the cave immediately illuminates.</p>
<p>With the lights, we could now see metallic tiles installed on rocky floors, and some ladders leading up to an elevated platform hosting some chests. There seemed to be wires hanging above, but translator couldn't make up what it is. The surrounding area is mostly barren: metal pillars, rocks, platforms, lights, floors, that accounted for most.</p>
<p>The lift call button also turned green as a result.</p>
<p>Back in the control room, as they saw the elevator moving, Manana danced gleefully, "Ohoho! It move!"</p>
<p>Riku announced to the team, "Now elevator behave self."</p>
<p>Eunie praised him, "Nice job, Riku. Always good to have a grease-Nopon that knows their way around techy things."</p>
<p>His 'nose' stood high, enjoyed the flattery, "This? Piece of pollen orb{{footnote: Pollen orb was something that originated in the Nopon village. First introduced in Xenoblade Chronicles 1, it was said to have some addictive effect, like the addictive drugs we abused today.}} for Riku."</p>
<p>Noah: "OK, let's go."</p>
<hr />
<p>(Upon arrival at the lift)</p>
<p>Some spiders, brown torso, and yellow abdomen with patches of irregularly shaped brown, dropped to the floor. The team got defensive as Lanz complained, "Gah, 'course there's monsters!"</p>
<p>Taion couldn't see a way around "Oh well, then. Nothing else for it, it seems."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed: "We don't have time to burn here. Let's ash 'em up, yeah?" They drew their blades as she finished.</p>
<p>Manana, her eyes shining, seemed to have made up her mind. She withdrew her wok hung behind her, a silvery with two loop handles, its diameter slightly smaller than her torso, and a fork and a knife made a 'cross' symbol at the wok's bottom, a circle containing 3 diamond-shaped stars, like those of Manana's blinking eyes, on top of where the 'cross' intercepted. "Manana help with fighting!"</p>
<p>"...Huh?" That caught Mio's attention as she looked towards Manana, just in time to see her spinning with the wok held over her head, generally in the direction of the spiders. As the team followed their glaze, "Meeeeeeeeeh-eh-eh!" The spiders were toppled, probably killed, where she landed blows.</p>
<p>Sena raised her voice by an octave of two, shouted out, "Manana?!"</p>
<p>Taion was shocked as well, "Don't be so rash-!"</p>
<p>"Manana did it!" After all the spiders went down, she congratulated herself while continued spinning. Riku closed his eyes in advance, foreboded something.</p>
<p>Mio realized an instant later, shouted to her, "Oh no! Manana, stop!"</p>
<p>"Manana cannot stop pot in mid-spiiin!"</p>
<p>Sena called out, "Watch out!" Then, she closed her eyes just before hearing the wok smashed against the rocky walls where she headed. Manana laid on the floor with the wok by her side.</p>
<p>With Mio on the lead, they ran up to her, "Um, Manana? Are you OK?!"</p>
<p>Sena, seemingly about to cry (in a worried voice), "Manana, please be OK!"</p>
<p>As she finished, Manana's eyes popped open, swooped her way up on her feet, concurrently got hold of her wok and stuffed it to her back as she stood, serenely spoke, "Manana is fine! Only heart go pitter-patter."</p>
<p>Noah, scratching his head, "Just watching you made my heart go pitter-patter."</p>
<p>Lanz shook his head, "Seriously, Manana, that was wild."</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance: "Phew... I'm glad you're safe, anyway."</p>
<p>As if she proved herself worthwhile, "See, Manana is good for many-much things beside cooking!"</p>
<p>Riku ruffled, with his wings wide opened, "Manana rush in like <em>crazypon</em> just to prove that?!"</p>
<p>Manana nodded frivolously, "Is important to demonstrate through action!"</p>
<p>Riku rebutted stodgily, "Manana did not just throw pot. Threw whole self along with it."</p>
<p>Manana turned to her back to show her pot, explaining, "Is special heavy-duty pot, also for self-defense. Exclusive Nopon brand!"</p>
<p>"Th-that not a thing..." Riku was speechless...</p>
<p>Mio stood in for him, "Manana, you have to understand that poor Riku was worried about you!"</p>
<p>Manana turned to look at Riku, trying to ascertain, "Is truth?!"</p>
<p>Riku, perhaps shy, or perhaps to save face, turned away from looking at her, "Not so much truth..."</p>
<p>"That very considerate! But Manana is really fine."</p>
<p>Lanz looked at Riku, "Yeah, that's right. Worrying too much isn't good for you either."</p>
<p>"Exactly. That why Riku not worry."</p>
<p>Eunie teased him, "Your blushy little cheeks aren't fooling anyone. Don't be ashamed!"</p>
<p>"No shame here! Noah, please come to defense of Riku."</p>
<p>Noah laughed at his reaction, "Hehehehe, you just didn't want your friend to be hurt. Shall we leave it at that?"</p>
<p>"Meh." Riku dropped his head as that's not the reply he wanted to hear, but seemingly there wasn't anyone to back him up, could only accept grudgingly.</p>
<p>That did cheer up the group. Noah cheerily turned to Manana, warned, "But Riku's right. No more crazy antics in the name of helping each other out, OK?"</p>
<p>"Manana understand! Not to do crazy antic in future."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, as Taion concluded, "Then it's settled. Let us descend." The group took for the lift.</p>
<hr />
<p>Upon arriving at the bottom, the group walked down the ladder connecting the elevator's platform to the rocky ground. There was a route to the right, but something behind the huge rock that defined the route's boundary caught Sena's eyes. It was some "liquid lime colored"{{footnote: RGB hex = <a href="https://icolorpalette.com/color/liquid-lime" target="_blank"><code>#cdf80c</code></a>}} open-air crystal. She shouted out, "Huh? Is it just me or is that rock sparkling?"</p>
<p>"Hoho! Maybe is-" That alerted Riku, running off towards the direction. We could see a tunnel leading to an open space on the left of the crystal.</p>
<p>The group followed behind as he assiduously inspected it, the excitement died down, "No. Just ordinary rock."</p>
<p>Mio: "What about this? I can't tell them apart..."</p>
<p>Riku assured, "That OK! That what Riku here for!"</p>
<p>"It's a good thing you're with us, Riku."</p>
<p>"Leave to Riku! First, Riku and friends search area!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena: "Hey, I found one!" They stopped by another "liquid lime" crystal stuck between a rock cavity. These had darker greens compared to the former, and some undulating liquid seemed incorporated in it.</p>
<p>Riku walked towards it, inspected it, and rejected it, "No, this not right. But is useful, so Riku take it." He scrapped a piece from the ore/crystal and stuffed it in his pocket.</p>
<hr />
<p>By yet another site, Eunie asked, "Isn't this one?" Still lime-colored, but seemingly glowed even dimmer than the one before.</p>
<p>"It look like, but is not. Observe here precisely. Intensity of luster grow dim."</p>
<p>Eunie squatted down to look where he pointed, but unsuccessfully observe any difference, lazily replied, "OK, I believe you."</p>
<p>"But it not useless! Keep hold for now." Another piece into his pocket.</p>
<hr />
<p>By yet another site, we could see some supporting metal beams to the left of the crystal. Taion squatted beside Riku, probability-wise bet it's not, "This is... not one."</p>
<p>Riku, surprised and not surprised that Taion could differentiate, "Oho? This might be valuable at later time, so we should keep." This one glows brighter than the others earlier. Yet another piece into his pocket!</p>
<p>"OK, got it."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group exited the tunnel into the area surrounded by cloud sky. They tramped down the green-algae-looking floor as Manana called out to Riku, whom was in front of her, "Riku seem to find great joy in rocks. He pick up so many!"</p>
<p>He stopped and turned to glance at her, "Gemstone and ore are different from normal rock scattered around. And ore we pick up from before have great utility." The others stopped to eavesdrop on their conversations.</p>
<p>In a disappointed tone, "Manana not rock scientist..."</p>
<p>Sena, stoked, joined the conversation "You can identify them all, Riku! You sure know a lot about rocks."</p>
<p>"Riku know thing or two."</p>
<p>Lanz didn't agree with his self-deprecation, "Don't be modest. You've got skills, mate. You should be an appraiser."</p>
<p>"Cease with flattering."</p>
<p>Sena debated against, "It's not flattery! It's good to have a hobby!"</p>
<p>"Manana in agreement!" Riku turned and faced another direction.</p>
<p>Lanz teasingly called out to him: "It's pretty good that we were able to come out rock-collecting, huh, Riku?"</p>
<p>Riku felt seriously offended, replied sternly, "Ore and gemstone! Not rock! From supply material to maintenance work, that Riku's job. It solemn responsibility to keep important equipment in tip-top order so everyone can come back alive." Then, looking sideways, picking on him, "Just doing own job. Not like Lanz."</p>
<p>"You what? I'm pretty much... <em>almost</em>... sort of doing it!"</p>
<p>Sena was impressed with his attitude, "Wow... You really give yourself a lot of responsibility, Riku."</p>
<p>Riku, scratching his head, trying to put a halt to the conversation that focused on him, "Too much talking. Out of Riku's character."</p>
<p>Noah disagreed, "Not at all. Understanding each other better isn't a bad thing, is it?"</p>
<p>Manana agreed. She walked a few steps and stood beside Riku, looking at his eyes, "That right. Become better friends is important."</p>
<p>Mio added, "We need to learn more about each other to become better friends, right?"</p>
<p>"That exactly truth. Learning about each other very important deal!" Manana backed her up. As if a light bulb shone above her head, "Ah, Manana has idea! Next, Manana will show faaaavorite thing!"</p>
<p>Riku was confused, "Next? It not about taking turns..."</p>
<p>Manana fluttered herself and her wings, discounted Riku's sternness nor his rebute, "Bate breath in readiness! Manana show you her specialty! You learn soon!"</p>
<p>"Over there is good place. Time for break!"</p>
<p>It looked like the remnants, a corner of a building. Where bricks had been demolished, plants climbed the surface. Stone pillars with platform remnants told us there used to be multiple storey. A bonfire was lit at the center of the structure. To its right, there was another remnant, this time circular and about one and a half storey high. On another remnants across the "cloud sea"{{footnote: Actually, there wasn't much clouds seen on this direction, but empty space.}}, another island with a structure that looked like a top stood itself, seemingly connected to the island the group was on via a rope. Trees grew in the distant, inaccessible small platforms.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sat around the bonfire, Lanz appreciated Manana's cooking: "Mmm, so tasty! Nothing like a hearty meal to keep you going for the long haul!"</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "It even wakes you up somehow."</p>
<p>Sena: "Endless rations{{footnote: These were the foods given to the colony, in 'rations', especially when the colony were lower rankings, if you heard the nurse hat guy speaking from before, in Ethel's colony before the assault.}} are so boring. You need to spice it up like this!"</p>
<p>"Manana couldn't agree more!" Then, she 'logically' targeted someone, "Taion only cook tragedies, so Manana work hard to learn cooking!"</p>
<p>Eunie was aroused, curious to learn more about his cooking, bent forward to keep her attention on her, "Ha! First I've heard of it. Is he <em>that</em> bad?"</p>
<p>That brings back memories, as she replied in a very low tone, "It very horrible."</p>
<p>Sitting beside Eunie, his hands crossed and explained himself, "Actually, my cooking just focuses more on efficient absorption of nutrients, and convenient portability. And I've actually optimized it."</p>
<p>Eunie jokingly asked: "...You mean it used to be even worse?"</p>
<p>"H-hey, now, I like Taion's cooking! It's... <em>unique</em>!" Mio disagreed, backed Taion up, in a chuffed intonation.</p>
<p>Noah offered a recourse, "It's OK. Swallow it down quickly and you'll probably be fine."</p>
<p>Sena, astonished, speaking to herself. "Do you... Do you really think you're helping...?"</p>
<p>"Is there second helping?" Riku looked to Manana, hoping for another portion.</p>
<p>"Oh yeah?" Lanz was alerted.</p>
<p>"...What?"</p>
<p>"What's this, Riku? Your favorite food or something?" He noticed something new about Riku, curiously prompted.</p>
<p>Rejecting his hypothesis to save his face with plenty of explanations, as usual, "Is not favorite. Is taste of Manana hard work, and is rude not to clean plate."</p>
<p>"Actually, Manana season with frazzlefish to bring out hidden flavor. Manana pleased Riku notice!" She was touching the ends of her feathers together, like how a human would used his/her index finger, gently touching the tip of each other as one speaks.</p>
<p>With an 'urmmmm' tone, tremblingly, he confessed, "Meeeehhh... Riku not know that actually."</p>
<p>Manana was confounded to her wrong hypothesis. "You not know? Well, Manana only happy you know now! And... Manana bring Riku whole mountain of seconds!" She trodded off into the distance, away from the bonfire.</p>
<p>Lanz, unsure who he's targeting the question to, prompted, "You think he minds?"</p>
<p>Mio answered, "It was so good he had seconds. And Manana knows how much he liked her cooking. I don't see the problem."</p>
<p>Sena added, "She was so happy."</p>
<p>Noah praised, "I think her ability to accept people's words upfront is one of her best points."</p>
<p>Mio: "Haha, maybe she's a little <em>too</em> upfront."</p>
<p>Taion added, "And her air of innocence is... characteristic of Nopon." Behind, we could see some brick-red walls covered with cement-colored, cement? Short patches of grass decorated the algae-ish surface. To the right of Taion, there was a path that made a perpendicular turn to its right{{footnote: So, if you drew an line that joined Taion and the brick wall, the route would be parallel to that line}}.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Upfront and innocent, huh..." She turned to look at Riku, referring to something.</p>
<p>He seemed to get what she meant with the descriptions, rebutted, "Riku is also good honest Nopon."</p>
<p>"Let's not get into that..." Eunie seemed unconvinced.</p>
<p>Sena brought the topic back to the 'rocks' of his, adored, "You were so serious when you were looking for the ore and gems. It's really good to be able to throw yourself into stuff like that so passionately. Like, into the things you love!"</p>
<p>To which he replied, "Sena is good person. Is shame Lanz lacking this quality..."</p>
<p>"Why are you always picking on me?!" Ouch! There was a description for this situation: 'Sitting at home doing nothing, a wok smashed on you unexpectedly'{{footnote: "人在家中坐，锅从天上来"}}.</p>
<p>Noah provided a respite on the pugnacious atmosphere, "Just up ahead might be Riku's treasure."</p>
<p>Sena, stoked, "Then let's go treasure-hunting!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Riku get mighty whiff of treasure here!"</p>
<p>Noah, putting an end on the conversation, "OK, let's have a quick breather and then start the search."{{footnote: Manana still hadn't come back, though...}}</p>
<p>"As Noah wish! We definitely find it!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As they entered a cave with some grass growing in a semicircle on the dry soil, Mio looked to her right. Some reddish ore revealed itself in open space. Spiderwebs seemingly blocked the way between them and the ore. "Huh? Hey isn't that...?"</p>
<p>Spiderwebs grew also on the group, and some of them stood on it{{footnote: Without getting stuck on it, to one's amazement.}}. "Ohoho! Now <em>that</em> what Riku call a gemstone!"{{footnote: Manana is now back online!}}</p>
<p>"Manana will bring back!" She immediately dashed towards the stone.</p>
<p>"Gemstone need careful handling. Riku will also go." He dashed after Manana after explaining his excitement away with reasoning. The group strodded slowly behind them, as Noah casually looked upwards, immediately alarmed and shouted, "Wait! Riku! Manana!"</p>
<p>Too late. They already arrived at the reddish ore. As they heard him, they turned and saw a spider with buff muscles on its cursive legs, two pair of fangs that in front of a face that looked like a bat, and two bat-like ears that had lime-green liquid flowing in its veins, stretching from where the "ears" of the bat's face, and patches of glowing turquoise on its abdomen. The spider approached Riku and Manana.</p>
<p>Manana: "Meh-meh-meh?!"</p>
<p>Riku: "This blight on personal record..."</p>
<p>Lanz shouted to them, "Wait there, we're coming!" Yet, smaller arachnids appeared behind the giant spider, facing the group and preventing them from disturbing their "mother" about to enjoy her feast.</p>
<p>Taion: "No good, they're coming this way too!"</p>
<p>Mio warned, "Drop the gem! The monsters seem to be after them!"</p>
<p>Riku wasn't willing, "Meeeeeeehhhh...!"</p>
<p>Manana pugnaciously rebutted, "That is precious thing! Cannot be thrown away!"</p>
<p>Riku, with a sorry and regret look, apologized to Manana, "Sorry to bundle Manana up in recklessness of Riku. Manana must throw gemstone over that way."</p>
<p>"But it your treasure, Riku!" She was surprised Riku willingly gave up his hobby for her life.</p>
<p>With a shaking voice, perhaps trying to suppress the difficulty in choosing, or maybe time wasn't on their side, "True... But if Manana throw, then monsters go also."</p>
<p>Manana refused, "Riku giving up too easy!"</p>
<p>"Meh-meh?!"</p>
<p>As if everything was under her control, "This nothing-trouble! And also... Riku say he get every treasure!"</p>
<p>"But Nopon not fight!" He looked down, finding excuses for both of them.{{footnote: Bro! The spider is really patient watching them quarrel, huh?!}}</p>
<p>"That irrelevant! Should become like Mio and Noah! If Riku and Manana work together, this piece of pollen orb! Riku not agree?"</p>
<p>"Manana..." His eyes met hers, encouraged his, "Riku agree. Riku not give up in this place!" Then, walked up to face the giant spider, "Riku here to get treasures and beat monsters!"</p>
<p>Manana joined in, "Manana can be behind that!"</p>
<p>"Is not yet time..." He drew out the weapon attached to his back, held it with  his wings. It shaped like a gun.</p>
<p>"... for give up!" Manana finished his sentence, drew out the wok and joined him.</p>
<p>"One, two..." They dashed past so quickly that the queen arachnid was sent into the air as they swooshed below her belly. She dropped to the ground while RIku and Manana arrived in front of Noah and the others.</p>
<p>Manana, fluttering her wings, "Magnificent success!"</p>
<p>Lanz was amazed, "Nice job, you two! What a team!"</p>
<p>Sena, with a worried voice, "I'm so glad you made it back!"</p>
<p>"Manana sorry for causing worry." She answered in a lower tone.</p>
<p>As Riku and Manana turned to face the queen arachnid, now got on its feet and turned its attention towards the group, Riku commented, "Now we see real Nopon potential!"</p>
<p>"That right! Maybe it impossible for one Nopon..."</p>
<p>"But not for two!"</p>
<p>"Together-fighting is better!" The group drew their blades and face the arachnids.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the fight.)</p>
<p>The group stood to face Riku and Manana. Lanz was relieved, "Phew. I didn't know how that was going to end."</p>
<p>Noah added, "Right? I was so surprised to see that from Riku and Manana!" We could see a tree growing in the background, by the way. More were growing on top of a taller platform filled with spiderwebs, behind Lanz, if Riku looked up at his face (from that angle).</p>
<p>Mio too, "I didn't know they could fight like that."</p>
<p>Riku clarified with sternness, "Riku is superior Nopon! Everyone know still Nopon run deep."</p>
<p>Lanz couldn't stand it, "Come off it, you aren't running anywhere."</p>
<p>Sena, "But now we know you can fight with us. How reassuring is that?!"</p>
<p>Manana, twinkles in her eyes, "We sorry for worry. But we learn that combine power together mean we can fight!" As she drew out the extracted magenta-ish crystal, "And that not all! We fetch back nice stash of gemstone!"</p>
<p>"Thanks for doing that, guys!"</p>
<p>Riku accepted it, "Yes! Getting best treasure is thanks to Riku."</p>
<p>Lanz, shaking his head, "Someone sounds chuffed with himself."</p>
<p>Taion suggested an end to the conversation, "Looks like the danger's passed for now. Let's keep going."</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "Right. We're still not out of these tunnels. Keep your guards up, everyone."</p>
<p>"Manana do Manana's best!"</p>
<p>Mio was enthused, "Haha, you're an asset to the team, you two!"</p>
<p>Riku looked away, explained away humbly, "... Riku just doing job." Manana looked at him, silently knew he was enjoying the flattery, and perhaps relieved they had got closer.</p>

<p>Continuing their journey on a flat surface, the surrounding barren; a slope located behind them, and some tunnels in their direction of travel. Halfway through, soldiers wearing Agnian armor fired some blasts that draws a purple tail as they flew. Hitting the ground in front of the group, it blasted, purple smoke released, blocking their view of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Defensively posed, more shots fired on to behind them, cutting their retreat route. Lanz gasped, "What the-... smokescreen?!"</p>
<p>Riku took a few breath, then covered his nose as he warned: "It smell weird! This... not just normal smoke!{{footnote: The translator think this is Riku, but the word 'smoke' seemed like Taion's voice.}}"</p>
<p>Taion, standing to his 5 o'clock, immediately covered his nose as he warned. The others quickly followed, backs facing each other in a circle. Soldiers with twin blades moved, their visor dragged a red trail as (s)he moved towards Noah.</p>
<p>Noah managed to react in time, swords bashing together as he sliced back. The soldier was quick to respond, retreated before (s)he suffered any injury, and vanished into the smoke. "They're hiding in the smoke!" The others withdrew their weapons.{{footnote: Which means, they no longer block their nose!}}</p>
<p>Mio's sharp ears counted the footsteps, then warned, "More incoming!"</p>
<p>An Agnian was driving towards Eunie. Mio, standing to her right, heard its arrival and moved to block for her. Yet, she felt a weakness and numbness, "Huh? My legs?!"</p>
<p>Her attention turned to her faltering legs, the soldier took the chance to slash just as her attention retargeted, sending her on to the ground. "Ahhhh!"</p>
<p>"Mimi!" Sena's hammer landed empty, though managed to prevent him/her from taking advanced actions. While she helped her up, (two) soldiers carrying guns appeared from their front, fired more somnolent gas at the group.</p>
<p>Lanz ran and blocked for Mio and Sena, warned "This smoke... Don't breathe it in!" Sticking his broadsword into the ground, he withdrew the hidden machine gun and fired at the gunned soldiers. Their agile movement dodged his bullets as they retrieved behind the smoke. Perhaps unaware, or perhaps believed in his teammates, he didn't turn to face a twin-blade soldier approaching from behind.</p>
<p>"Who the spark are they?!" Eunie had his back.</p>
<p>Manana replied, her wok 'shield' carried in front of her, "Soldiers from Agnus, duh!"</p>
<p>Taion deflected a soldier with his Mondo, commented, "I... I know this maneuver...!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Noah, to the right of him, prompted for more.</p>
<p>"One of Colony 13's little specialties." That brought him back to the past memories, how Lambda's soldiers were slaughtered by the Kevesi without mercy.</p>
<p>Lanz, still firing his guns, "So, you've seen this before? But... wait a mo, these mudders are Agnian!"</p>
<p>"I don't get it... Why this specific tactic...?" His mondo made a barrier in front of him, giving him the time to think and hypothesized, "Could it be... the commander...?!"</p>
<p>Even without soldiers attacking them, the soldiers whom initially fired the shots, standing at a higher platform to both side of their route, continued firing more smoke, making it thicker.</p>
<p>Eunie now laid her back on Taion, "This is looking grim... There's no way to tell where they're gonna come from next!"</p>
<p>"Urgggg..." Recalling how they had handled it from before, he commented, "Water."</p>
<p>"Water?" Eunie wasn't sure what he's talking about.</p>
<p>"Yeah. There are water veins in these caves. We can use them to make an escape."</p>
<p>"You sayin' make a dash for it?"</p>
<p>"Errrr...." Taion's eye scanned the vicinity as he continued to analyze the situation, to take in more information. Red trail were encircling them while others waited for him.</p>
<p>Lanz, still firing his gun at a single direction, urged, "Taion, decide! Look, I trust your judgment!"</p>
<p>"You do...?" His fist clenched, had no choice but nodded, then shouted to the group,  "All right... We'll have to run. I judge it to be the best option right now!"</p>
<p>"All I needed to hear. Let's move! Lead the way!" Lanz was relieved, sheathing his machine gun as he had his back.</p>
<p>"I'm on it." He make for a run, the others followed, two by two.</p>
<hr />
<p>They arrived before the gushing river, cleared of anesthetic smoke. There was some roof structure behind them, and he stood where he and Nimue stood before, on the wooden (or maybe metallic) platform facing the river. "This is it!"</p>
<p>All except Eunie walked up to assess the river, Eunie on the lookout. Except for some metal beams to her 10 o'clock, above the slope in front of Eunie, purple smoke were quick to spread towards their direction.</p>
<p>While Noah was making further analysis, or to ask his gut, Eunie called out, "They're here! Can't see 'em, but it's a real welcome party."</p>
<p>No more time to think. He looked towards Mio, whom nodded back at him. The final decision had been made, "Time to go! Big breath, then jump!" He took the lead and plunged head first into the stream.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were running from rocky ground towards grassy, leafy, flowery, ground. A tree, beside a cylindrical rock, the base of a waterfall in the distant, the evaporating water vapor/mist enshrouded our view of what's behind.</p>
<p>Just as they dashed past the tree, Noah, on the lead, stopped on his track, and others were quick to follow. The ground shook, loud noise from where they were facing, which is actually a base of another waterfall. Defensively, they watched as a pike with an Agnian Flame Clock, half-filled, emerged from behind. It was so huge its torso temporarily cut the whole width of the waterfall from reaching where it normally reach. Fully emerged, it drove and landed in front of the group, shadowing them from the sunlight with its Flame Clock. With waters still dripping, it extended both its legs and landed on the edge of the island before them, sending dirt splashing up, and it "turned on" its eyes.</p>
<p>From below it, levnises of various types (the ball bearing type with two swords on its hand which we saw during the Guernica mission, and the four-armed autonomous levnis they fought back at the Colony 18's battlefield) surrounded them.</p>
<p>Isurd, his right iris blood red, walked out of the ferronis on the higher platform (a platform higher than the horn above the Flame Clock).</p>
<p>Taion's eyes gleamed, "I knew it... Commander Isurd!"</p>
<p>Isurd sneeringly shouted back, "Long time no see, <em>Taion</em>!"</p>
<p>"That guy..." Eunie recognized him from Taion's past memories.</p>
<p>"So they got to you too. Commander!" Taion shouted back. "Did they order you to destroy Ouroboros too?" Soldiers now joined the levnises, encircling them.</p>
<p>Isurd replied, "Not... exactly."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You must've worked it out. This strategy... mirrors that day. When Nimue's life... was cut short!" His voice, sharp and vicious, struck at Taion's emotional chord.</p>
<p>Taion's iris widened. The commander, joyful his tactic worked out, continued, "I figured you would try to use that route to flee. That's how I knew to wait right here. And so I replicated the conditions of that day to a tee."</p>
<p>Taion took a step backward, questioned, "But why do such thing?!"</p>
<p>Starting with a calm tone, then undulating, lively, "Why? Well, let's see... In a nutshell... To remind you- of your past! To make you relive it, and drive you to despair! To break your heart! To steal all that you hold dear!" Clenching his fist tempestuously in front of him, "To ruin you to your very core! Wahahahahahahahah!"</p>
<p>"That is my revenge! It's payback for Nimue dying with her wish unfulfilled! It's your own past! Its finally caught up with you!" He pugnaciously sneered at him.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence, and Taion seemed stoical. A moment later, the stone weighted too deep in his heart. He closed his eyes, looked down, and his breathe betrayed him, recalling his conversation with Isurd after the mission.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-taions-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#start-of-taions-memories-1">(Start of Taion's memories)</a></h4>
<p>In the dimly-lit commander's tent, young Taion spoke <em>something</em>{{footnote: We couldn't hear what this something is.}} to the commander. Isurd listened attentively, gently nodded as he finished. Then, Taion looked down to his 11 o'clock in agony. Isurd took two steps forward, put his hand on his shoulder. Perhaps distracted, he brought out Nimue's stopwatch gadget from his pocket, held it on his palm, glancing at it.</p>
<p>Isurd took his hands off him, calmly asked, "Nimue gave it to you, right? You should hold on to it."</p>
<p>With a tone trying to hold back his tears, "It was... my fault... My pride led to her death. If only I'd presented a less reckless plan... The strategist would never have... Nimue would..." He gripped on to the gadget forcefully.</p>
<p>As tears aggregated, he held out the gadget straight at the commander, not daring to look at him as he wept. Whimperingly, "It- It's too much for me..." Then, he put his hands down{{footnote: Translator couldn't see whether he gave it to him or not.}} "I don't... I don't deserve this..." As he spoke, he took steps backward, and leave thereafter.</p>
<p>Isurd right palm held upwards{{footnote: Again, one couldn't see whether there is any gadget on his hand or not}}, looking at him leaving, didn't say a thing nor tried retaining him.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-taions-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-taions-memories-1">(End of Taion's memories)</a></h4>
<p>The smiling, red-iris Isurd looked down on Taion, watching him grieved his past loss.</p>
<p>"It's true... It is my fault..." His fingers slowly and tremblingly clenched into a grip, "You were the kindest man I knew, Commander..." Then, raised his tone two octaves, "But I made you use the same enemy tactic that cost Nimue her life..." He looked up at him, "I drove you to such desperation, and now... you're determined to kill me..."</p>
<p>Calmly spoken, "Precisely right, Taion." As he finished, he turned to re-enter the torso of the Ferronis. Before he entered the door, he looked to his side, "The past..." then turn to him, in a vicious tone, "has come back to haunt you!" Then turned and walked in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Bang! The ferronis's leg dragged along the muddy ground, its "hands" tucked into the ground to increase drag, sending dirt into the air. The group, with water halfway up to their ankle, stood and watched. Isurd almost lose balance inside the ferronis control room, tempestuously snapped at them, "Lay down and die already!"</p>
<p>As the ferronis tilted its head upwards, beams emanated from around the edge of its disc plate (that looks like a turtle's shell), top and bottom, in all direction. The beam randomly swing itself to cover all possible regions, though there was a chance it tracked down the group's location and, working together, chased after them. Beams that pierced into the ground sent dirt and rocks flying where it sliced through.</p>
<p>The group groaned as they dodged the beam, flying backwards. Someone as agile as Mio acrobatically jumped sideways as it swooped past. As for the heavy Lanz, where he can't dodged, he raised a shield to block the passing attacks.</p>
<p>Behind the ferronis, trees grew on top of the waterfall. There was a cement-looking building on one of the top, unsure what it was.</p>
<p>Taion stood stationary, looking up at the Ferronis, shouted out,"Commander Isurd...! Please... Please, stop this now!"</p>
<p>Eunie was rolling on the water before she got up on her feet, shouting, "Taion..." We could see two beams drilling through some rock and dirt, closing in to Eunie. She ran after Taion, hugged{{footnote: her hands around his neck}} and dislodged him just before a beam zoomed past his left. They were headed towards water.</p>
<p>His attention locked to the Ferronis; he held out his left hand, trying to reach out for <em>something</em>, perhaps the commander's heart? His mouth wide opened, still trying to convince him. Time passed really slow. He could see the blue sky with mostly cirrus clouds, a horn stuck out to the left, blurred in the background, some trees at the edge of his vision; but mostly, the various feathers (of unknown species and unknown origin) that floated down; his hands, in a grabbing posture, trying to reach out to the one nearest.</p>
<p>His trial wasn't futile; the feather floated closer and closer to his hands. As he blinked his eye, the Ouroboros symbol glowed in his left Iris, the feather finally within reach, and he grabbed on to it. Cyan lights covered his body surface as they plunged into the water, and splashed not just where they collide with it, and also around it.</p>
<p>A bright light brought them into the yellow-smoke memory space. "<em>If you haven't used this power back there, you'll be... a win would've been a nice surprise... quick! we're going to miss the homecoming... first one they've ever had here, right? Eunie!!!</em>" On Eunie's side, Isurd and Nimue surrounded her, The swirling yellow strips swallowed as they transformed into globules, collided, and formed the Ouroboros Core.</p>
<p>Water was rippling vigorously, ald temporarily calmed down a little, before the bubbling burst, splashing water up tens of meters up high.</p>
<p>"What the...?" Isurd was surprised. Taion's Ouroboros, wearing a white robe, with female-like hands, black slim fingers; the conical-shaped sleeves that tightened around his elbow displayed veins of purple and orange (classical ouroboros color), cyan feather on the edge of the sleeve. We could also see cyan feathers arranged in flower petals behind his heads, and it seemed a visor attached to his forehead. A ring that grew out of his chest, tilted 15° to the vertical, it closed behind his head, and 4 feathers attached to it. It also had knee plates on its ankle. Oh, let's not forget the triangle mouth with metallic moustache.</p>
<p>As it glanced at the Ferronis, water splashed meters high encircled it; with its fall, emerged more replicas of Taion's Ouroboros, all floating mid-air. Soldiers{{footnote: We could see not just normal soldiers, but also those wearing special helmet that probably protected them from sniffing in purple gas.}} on the ground aiming their guns incessantly changing their aims. Isurd himself was horrified to identify, switching his view angle as he questioned, "Wh-which one?! Which one's real?"</p>
<p>He figured the easiest way to determine is to destroy all of them. Cannon beams zipped past, most of them burnt like burning papers, with smoke released, before turning into dust and paper scraps. "This one?!" He waved his hands to his left. Taion's Ouroboroses doesn't stay still after Isurd's initial action, dodging the beams athletically. Yet, the concentration of the beam caught up with them in the end, shattering them.</p>
<p>"How about here?!" He now turned to his right, the same thing happened; he still hadn't distinguished him from his doppelgängers. His teeth gritted, he scanned for more; only paper scraps floated to the ground behind him{{footnote: All that we could see.}}. Then, something above the ferronis caught his eyes; he gaped at it.</p>
<p>A massive boulder not much smaller or larger than the disc plate on the ferronis floating above it, shadowing it. Taion's Ouroboros was at the bottom of the boulder, 'creating antigravity' on it. As he lowered his arms, the boulder plotted a trajectory towards the top of the ferronis while Isurd watched effetely in horror. "Urg!" To prepare for the impact, he crossed his arms above his face, hoping it would've blocked it.</p>
<p>The last moment before impact, the ferronis already lowered its torso to prepare for impact, they did not touch. The boulder disappeared into scraps of paper that polluted the atmosphere. The groups, Sena beside Lanz on a ground, Mio behind Noah stood on knee-high water, watched as the pieces dropped. The pieces shaped like Mondo, except there were red patches that decorated it.</p>
<p>Isurd got out of his protective stance, feeling humiliated, "Wha- Another illusion?!"</p>
<p>Noah held out his hands as a Mondo with drawn symbols on its back and triangles of red patches folded on it, landed on his palm{{footnote: And Mio watching.}}. The Mondo aptly stood up, waved at him, before turning to its left and jumped off.</p>
<p>"Gh... Playing me for a fool?! <strong>AAARRRRRGGGGHHHHHH, I'll show you a fool! I'll blow you away, you and all your rustling phantoms!</strong>" Isurd turned around as he whipped the air, before sighting Taion in the distance, beside where a giant wheel-like structure half stuck into some platform. Exasperated, he activated the central cannon located on the chest of the ferronis. The metal structure opened up to reveal the cannon, its inner structure signifies those of an airplane's engine, pushed out of its chest before aiming at Taion's Ouroboros, gathering a huge yellow globules of energy only comparable to Ethel's ferronis's purple lightning ball that K maneuvered before.</p>
<p>"Whoa... Intense... I can't defend against that..." Lanz, flabbergasted, shook his head in confirmation. Sena watched intensely at Taion's Ouroboros as she convinced herself, "If Taion took the Ouroboros form... I can too!" She sheathed her weapons as she ran towards the ferronis, calling out, "Lanz! Come with me!"</p>
<p>"You insane!" Lanz was shocked. He stood up and sheathed his weapon.</p>
<p>"Just trust me! Hurry!" She galvanized him to run after her!</p>
<p>"<strong>It's over! TAION!</strong>" Isurd, his mind now totally hijacked...</p>
<p>Sena, with an unwavering voice, the Ouroboros symbol started glowing her left iris as she made her speech, "Taion, all of you... I won't let this creep... <strong>lay a finger on anyone!</strong>" Lanz was now running beside her. At the end of the island was an elevated rock, which they jumped, hands reaching out as blue spirals engulfed them.</p>
<p>"<em>Quick thinking Lanz... Get off me, had to be the hero... Come on, he's trying to protect you... just stop it... no more arguing... you gonna hit something...</em>"{{footnote:Sena almost toppled as she put a few steps in front just to rebalance.}} "<em>we... haven't met before, have we?</em>" The last voice was Mio's in Sena's memory; they both watched until yellow spirals encircled them, engulfed them, collided, and generated the Ouroboros Core.</p>
<p>Still flying in mid-air, an Ouroboros with a pair of wings that shaped like palms, and two butterfly-winged shape 'knives' below it, floated behind her. Her braided hair formed a tail that resembled a whip, with a burning ring at the end of the 'whip'. It jumped and landed beside the left knee of the ferronis, palms holding in front in a 'ready to push' position. Jet engine flames burnt behind her 'shoes', which was like roller coaster, dragging along the ground. She laid her right hand on the feet as she continually dragged along its circumference until she reached a calculated position, stopped herself with another hand gripping on it, hugging its leg. Her eyes blinked a moment.</p>
<p>Inside the control room, Isurd hadn't noticed her arrival until the ground shook below him. He turned and saw Sena's Ouroboros pulling its left leg upwards, the jet engine on her legs blasted at full speed, sending black smoke in the direction of of its blast, she shouted for strength "ErrrrrrrrrAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!".</p>
<p>"Whhhhhhhoooooooaaaaaaa<strong>OOOOOOOAAAAAAAAHHHHHH</strong>!!!" Isurd was horrified as he lost his footings, his bent his knee and put his hands on the ground to regain balance.</p>
<p>As she threw the leg up on to the air, she spinned along her vertical axis, her 'whip' transformed withdrawn and transformed into a hammer; the wings still on he handle side, while the giant hammer (with butterfly wings attached to its back) on the other side.</p>
<p>"<strong>ErrrrrrrrrAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!</strong>" She launched herself towards the tossed leg, vision locked onto it, smashing it so hard it reached a new equilibrium: to land on its back.</p>
<p>"<strong>No...! Unacceptable!</strong>" With Isurd voice emanating from the control room, the cannon aggregated to its threshold, a beam shot into the open air while the ferronis fell first on its left side{{footnote: The beam probably give laid some physics force on the ferronis, via Newton's third law, that changed its course slightly.}}, before landing on its back. We could now see the ferronis is actually turtle shape, and not two legs but four, just like a real turtle, now that its legs faced upwards.</p>
<p>As it crashed down, soldiers and levnises were running for their lives. Some soldiers looked back just to get themselved tossed by the immense rippling shockwave, dragged along the water. Sena's Ouroboros clung tight to a rock stuck from underwater to prevent the shockwave from sending her flying off. Only now was Taion's Ouroboros floated and stopped landing, a relatively low height from the water surface.</p>
<p>The ferronis wasn't giving up so readily. Its cannons retained its ability to fire despite being toppled. With such desperation, it no longer looked out for its own soldiers, the willingness to sacrifice whoever was in its way. Sena's Ouroboros jumped in all directions, dodging them with agile. She sometimes passed very near Agnian soldiers, the beam zwooped past and killed them while targeting her.</p>
<p>Mio and Noah regrouped, back to back, overlooking the Flame Clock to their side (or rather, they stood in front of the Flame Clock). "The Flame Clock! It has to go!"</p>
<p>As Mio finished her sentence, a beam sliced between them; they dodged to both sides, both their currently travelling paths joined to form an oval/ellipsoidal shape, each carefully avoided the beams. Noah started to chant Ethel's final warning, "Embers on coat... Brush them off."</p>
<p>"If push comes to shove, do not flinch!" Mio continued the sentence. They ran to intersect one another.</p>
<p>"Do whatever it takes!"</p>
<p>Then together, "For the greater good!" Running side by side, blue lights enshrouded their surface, and...</p>
<p>"<em>The dead don't think anything...They don't speak, to me... Stop crying, Lanz! It won't change anything... it's the feeling you...</em>" "<em>I was top of the rankings in all... is that why you're here?... is that why you're being an off-seer?</em>" They joined course into an Ouroboros Core, Mio's Ouroboros, purple hairs flowed behind like a waterfall. Rings attached to behind its elbow and to its side, with two more below the legs that acts like "ice-skater", though it was so light it could skate on top of the water surface. It also had a pair of cat-like ears.</p>
<p>The beam tried to reach her, but she changed directions so fast it leaves afterimages. Perhaps Isurd had calculated where it would land in the future, fired several beams together at a single point, water vapor and smokes enshrouded his view. Yellow electric sparkles flowed through its surface.</p>
<p>Suddenly, water splashed, together with Mio's Ouroboros, so high it seemed to reached the higher platforms where trees grew. Mio's Ouroboros did plenty of somersault while in air, until it reached the highest point the force could brought her to. Aiming at the central cannon, she pushed both legs and both hands behind to increase their speed towards the Ferronis, as she called out to Noah, "Better make it count!" Then, they cancelled the Interlink.</p>
<p>"I was planning to!" He replied, Lucky Seven already unsheathed by the time they cancelled. His legs were folded to push forward faster, Mio behind him to provide a platform he could push on. She flew backwards into the air while he dived even faster towards the Ferronis.</p>
<p>The ferronis central cannon was already at its tipping point, blasted in Noah's direction. He held out his left-arm gauntlet (the Lucky Seven sheathe that transformed) and surprisingly, it prevented the beam from going further, forming a 'heliosphere' of radiating rainbow around him as continued to move even closer to the Ferronis.</p>
<p>As the beam came to a close{{footnote: Meaning, it blasted only for <em>n</em> seconds, and after that, no more.}}, he swung his body to his left, his left arm in a punching position, with the Lucky Seven horizontally position to his left, as if to slice something from left to right; he did slice it, though not for slicing the clock but slicing the air to give him force.</p>
<p>As he targeted the Flame Clock, he grabbed the Lucky Seven's handle with both hands, its tip facing down, finally piercing into the Flame Clock. 'Lives' splattered from its wounds, immediately the high-pressure 'lives' splashed out analogous to a broken artery spilling blood. Less concentrated 'lives' splashed out towards the side, and the Flame Clock quickly drained of its gauge. No more 'lives' splashing out, but none within either, and the Ferronis shut down.</p>
<hr />
<p>Dual-blade Agnian soldiers surrounded the group, now cancelled their Interlink. Isurd dropped hands on the ground, his effete feet had trouble supporting his weight. He struggled back up, walked a few more steps and stopped beside an Agnian soldier, panting with each step.</p>
<p>Taion dashed and stopped below Noah's blade, held his arms wide, blocking Isurd, whom was directly in front of Noah before, from progressing further. "Come on... Enough is enough, Commander... There's no reason for us to be fighting each other. If you still need a life to satisfy you, you can have mine."</p>
<p>"<strong>Taion?!</strong>" Feeling unacceptable, Eunie loudly called out.</p>
<p>Touching both hands on his heart, "If that helps put your heart at ease... <em>If it settles the debt I owe Nimue</em>... I'll do it."</p>
<p>"Eehehehehehehehehe, <strong>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</strong>!!!!" As if he heard the most funny thing ever, he laughed and laughed, and turned into a mud statue before crashing into the ground; a puddle of dark mud{{footnote: See second video; there were some rendering issue with first video that showed it gray.}} crashed into the light brown soil, forming a puddle of polluting substance.</p>
<p>"Whuh?" Taion took a step back, the others sheathed their blades. "_C-Commander?!__"</p>
<p>Riku and Manana joined the team from their hiding place, with Riku asking, "He turn into mud pie?" The other Agnian soldiers had their blade sheathed too.</p>
<p>Above the mud, purple specks of particles gradually aggregated, and Consul J materialized before their eyes. He scanned the horizon left and right before speaking to the group, "Have you ever felt so much fondness, that it made you... quiver?"</p>
<p>"Huh? That voice..." Something deep and stagnant in his memory triggered. Mio was curious.</p>
<p>Pacing left and right, he introduced, "Long time no see... You forgot about me... I missed you... All these sayings that have to do with time... They ring so insufferably hollow, when you only have ten years on the clock. It doesn't feel real. But you know..."</p>
<p>"No... It can't be..." Stopping few meters in front of Eunie, she realized it too.</p>
<p>Turning to face them one by one as he called out names, "Noah... Eunie... Riku... Lanz... I have to tell you... I'm overwhelmed with emotion!" He raised his right hand, clicked on a button behind his neck; the helmet spiralled into nothingness, revealing his face, which the Kevesi gasped, eyes wide opened,</p>
<p>Lanz, surprisingly, "Joran!"</p>
<p>"<em>Sincerely... I'm on the verge of tears.</em>"</p>
<p>"Joran... But you...!" He took two steps forward, can't believe his eyes.</p>
<p>"Joran...?" Sena watched his reaction,</p>
<p>Mio, one step behind him{{footnote: 8 o'clock}}, prompted, "You know him?" He didn't reply, but she recalled what she saw in his past memories, "Wait... <em>I</em> know him... Yes, Joran... amid the rubble and the flames..."</p>
<p>Sena lightly called out, "He died in a battle with Agnus... They were all friends."</p>
<p>Taion skeptically challenged the notion, "But wait... How does that work? H-How can he be...?!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Assuming the memories we saw were correct... " She and Sena turned to face Noah, with Sena prompting for assurances,</p>
<p>"Noah...?" He displayed in inscrutable face, though his quivering breathe a few seconds later gave it up. Lanz drew their attention, walking towards Joran, "Joran! You're... You're our Joran! Y-you were alive?!" He stopped a few steps away from him.</p>
<p>In a gleeful tone, he returned the question, "Was I alive? Hah! Of course not. I did die on that day! Evidently! That's why I can be here now!" His speech moved with lively body emotions, putting his hands on his chest, then held it out in front of him, then held it out wide as if to embrace. "You can call me J! Guess what?" Using his right hand, he pushed the long dark green hair that hid his right iris so they could watch the glowing Moebius ring in it, "I'm a proud member of Moebius now!"</p>
<p>"<strong>No...! You can't mean it...?!</strong>" with a shaking voice, Noah, and the other Kevesi, took a step backward, couldn't believe their eyes.</p>
<p>"J-Joran..." Eunie sadly, softly called out.</p>
<p>"You see, they gave me this incredible power... I can take... people's memories... and refashion them into my very own mudpuppets." He squatted down to look at the pile of mud Isurd formed.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Mudpuppets...?"</p>
<p>"'Refashion' my wings!" Her tone suppressed her anger.</p>
<p>He stood up, took a few steps to his right before teleported behind an Agnian soldier, stabbed him with a short knife from behind. The group gasped at what he did.</p>
<p>"N-not yet... I can still..." The soldier called out, his tone getting deeper as he turned into a mud statue, then fell under gravity, creating another puddle of mud in front of Joran. The group breathe shakily, can't believed their eyes, nor could they assign the current Joran to their Joran in memory.</p>
<p>His knives held out, he teleported and repeated the same thing; this time, a female soldier, but her tone nor her fate changed, "I don't wanna die! Don't make me die here, please!"</p>
<p>"I told you we shouldn't have come here... You just had to make me..."</p>
<p>He explained; the group had been facing him even as he changed target: "The body may be mud, but their minds are the real deal. But without hearts, they're pretty quick to tell you what's on their minds!" This time, he didn't teleport, but walked slowly in a circle around the group.</p>
<p>"Grrrrffffttt!!!" Taion angrily snorted, but effetely didn't stop him.</p>
<p>"Joran..." Noah pitifully watched what he did.</p>
<p>"To be honest... These nobodies are beneath me. Noah, Eunie, or Lanz... <em>You'd</em> make good puppets." As he finished the last of the Agnian soldiers, his tone turned gloating, "What profound and clear-sighted words would your cold lips utter? I've so wished to hear... Why did you have to go and become Ouroboros, hm? <em>Hehehehehehehehheheheheh...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie questioned him, "J-Joran... You were never like this! What did they do to you?!"</p>
<p>"What do you think you knew of me? You didn't know anything." Her assumptions challenged, she can't believe it. "I am only myself, Eunie." In disappointment, she looked down.</p>
<p>"The realest, truest, me! <strong>I don't need to hide any more! I can finally be me!</strong>" He bent forward, his eyes wide opened, hands held up with palms facing his face, "Becoming Moebius? Best thing that ever happened to me!" Touched his right hand on his heart, tone getting higher and higher, "I want you to feel it...! Feel the joy I feel!" His hands wide opened, as if to embrace them, "<strong>Feel my absolute elation!</strong>" Then, he drew his weapon, prepare to fight them.</p>
<p>Final note about the environment, there was a bridge behind where he stood, trees and rocky hills in the distance. It seemed like a waterfall falling into unlimited zone{{footnote: "unlimited" means "inaccessible", which means, no game data available, which means, if you jumped down, you'd get teleported to a checkpoint near where you jumped.}} below the bridge.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the fight)</p>
<p>The group sheathed their blades, Joran eyes wide opened, embracing, asked for feedback, "Did you get a good taste of it? Of my elation...?"</p>
<p>"Cut the crap!" Lanz clenched his fist, utterly disappointed with him, "What're ya droning on about?! I don't buy it... I refuse to believe you're him...! You aren't our Joran! <strong>Joran saved our lives!</strong>"</p>
<h4 id="start-of-kevesis-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-kevesis-memories">(Start of Kevesi's Memories)</a></h4>
<p>Dark and dusty sky; not even the raging flames could lit its vicinity. Patrolling Agnian levnises slicing buildings where it passed, which exploded. Along a path, young Noah leading the way; Eunie, Joran, and Riku followed behind, panting; Lanz and Garvel last. Explosions released shockwaves that shook the ground.</p>
<p>There was a "meteor" that blasted at a building 11 o'clock their direction, shattering a metal beam support, it fell towards where the group were about to trespass. "Yurrrrrrrrrr<strong>AHHHHHHHHH</strong>" They darted, jumped, dragged, and rolled on the ground, barely dodging the beam. Unfortunately, Lanz and Garvel didn't made it. His lower torso buried by the beam; Garvel completely under. Lanz had trouble dragging himself out, "UUUUURRRRRHHHHH!!!"</p>
<p>"Lanz! Garvel!" Noah called out, he darted a few steps, but Eunie held him back by his arms,</p>
<p>"No time! Look! Above!" Flames raging behind a whole storey made of metal, flames sparkles where beams were supporting it. It tilted 10 extra degrees towards their path.</p>
<p>"We can't-"</p>
<p>"Noah!" Eunie cut him off. He turned to look at her. Lanz was still groaning as he tried to force himself.</p>
<p>"Move it!" Garvel called out to Noah and the others.</p>
<p>"Lanz!" Noah watched back in agony.</p>
<p>"We can take care of ourselves! Just go!" Noah gritted his teeth between the decision to leave or to save him, frozen. Eunie still held his arms. Joran didn't wait; he darted towards Lanz and Garvel, supported himself to push the metal beam upwards.</p>
<p>Lanz was surprised. "Jo-Joran?!"</p>
<p>"Nggggggggg..." It was too heavy for him. "Wh... Why are-" Garvel equally.</p>
<p>"You dumb clod... Come on... Joran..." Lanz hoped he would run and save his asses. Joran adamantly ignored and continued his effort. That convinced Noah and the others,</p>
<p>"Joran!" He dashed towards him, the others followed. Together, they raised the beam enough for Lanz to climb out.He held his hands to Garvel thereafter and pulled him out too. The beam crashed onto the floor as the group released their push; Lanz was sitting down. Garvel on all fours; Riku and Eunie rushed to help him up.</p>
<p>Noah turned to Lanz, held his hands to offer him a pull, "You hurt? Can you run?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, more or less..." As he stood, he turned to look around him. Eunie hold on to Garvel's arm; he found Joran panting to his right, questioned, "Joran... Why...?" Their eyes met, disturbed by Noah's arm on Lanz's shoulder,</p>
<p>"We should go!"</p>
<p>Lanz turned to face him, "Yeah." The group continued running, Joran and Lanz stood still for a moment. He nodded to Joran before they started walking, with Joran a step behind{{footnote: To his 5 o'clock.}}</p>
<p>Metal creaking sound caught Joran's attention. He turned to back, upwards, and whimpered horifically. The group stopped at the distress signal he sent. "Huh?"</p>
<p>The metal storey finally put too much stress on its support, came crashing down towards Lanz and Joran.</p>
<p>"Watch out!" Joran, his hands on Lanz's chest, shoved him away. His action took him aghast; his eyes fixed on him. Flames burning behind, rocks tumbling around, Joran smiled back at him, his destiny fulfilled. Lanz's right arm held out, his last effort to reach him in agony. Smaller and smaller as he flew farther and farther; separated by an imaginary sheathe of rocks and pebbles, before the whole floor buried him alive.</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh!" The ground shielded their face from the dust and shards; Lanz effetely sat on the ground; the group took a moment to realize what they had lost, forever.</p>
<p>"Joran...? Joran?" He stood up and took steps toward the debris, only to had Noah grabbing his left arm. Unconvinced, he forcefully pushed, "Joran! <strong>Jooooraaaaaannnn!!!!!</strong>" Noah hugged him from behind, dragged him away as more rubble, flames, and rocks covered the existing remnants. What was buried was not only Joran, but his choice to apologize, his choice to say, "Thank you."</p>
<h4 id="end-of-kevesis-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-kevesis-memories">(End of Kevesi's Memories)</a></h4>
<p>"You don't get it? You honestly don't get it? In that instant, I rose above you miserable fools! By saving your... worthless! Piddling! Lives!" He held his hands in front of him, as if clenching his fist would crush Lanz from his head into his torso{{footnote: Due to distance, your hands can 'measure/grab' huge object, like trees, imaginarily, if you stood far enough from it, if you get what one means.}}. Joyfully, "It was indescribable, Lanz!"</p>
<p>Lanz took a step backward, disappointed at his adamant, sharing no similitude in emotions. Noah looked at him pitifully, "Joran..."</p>
<p>"Ahh, wasn't this fun?" He turned with his back facing them, "I guess I'll call it a day here." He dancingly took steps forward, "Can't be hoarding all the fun for myself now. Gotta leave some for the next guy or gal."</p>
<p>"Say what?" Lanz was flabbergasted. With his back facing them, Joran spoke,</p>
<p>"I should thank you, Lanz." Lanz's contracted his eyelid's muscles as he watched Joran turned to see him from the tip of his eyes, between his long hairs, "'Cause I get to be like this now, and I owe it to you." Purple particles arose from his body as he spoke, "Toodles!" Then disappeared into thin air.{{footnote: As one mentioned, there were rendering errors with the first video, no purple particles; see the second video instead.}}</p>
<p>The group retained vision where he left for a moment while they calmed themselves, their minds unconsciously sorting out the clash between sorrow and gleefulness that filled the atmosphere.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note on Environment:</strong> On the platform where the rusty abandoned wheel we saw before, puny animals (squirrel-like, but looked like bunnits, dark gray) running along the path 'behind' it (if the waterfall where a 'triangle' stood out of it was called 'forward'). Trees, ferns, and grass paved the shoulder of the road. Another scene: Waterfall falling in layers, each step with a platform. Several animals with like 'balls', arranged in a circle, like flower petals, submerged below the water surface in the platform. This drowned platform is accessible from a path to the left of it, seen from image's point of view. An eagle soared above the flower petal animals. There were high-tech buildings at a platform higher than where the flower-petal animals made their home. And of course, trees that grew slightly towards the horizontal, their roots stuck on the vertical platform between the waterfall. Yet another scene. Waterfall scene in the distance, behind some rocks. In between the rocks and the waterfall, some pea-pods like trees stood taller than the rocks, their leaves more blue than green. On the 'pond', high-tech buildings (with glass windows, translucent tiles, or metal-looking structure) buried into the rocks to the right of the image. In front of them, an island with an Agnian levnis. In the same direction, in 'front' of the island, waterfall down to lower level. Final scene: rainbows! Lambda's Ferronis seen on the bottom left of the image, relatively far from the stepped waterfalls. This, is <strong>Great Cotte Falls</strong>, of Pentelas Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The evening sunlight caressed the soil and water vapor, the latter enshrouded the fallen Ferronis. The group tramped on a shady area of the island. The sound of water fall from behind. Tents laid in front of them, mostly along the rocky walls. Streetlights only lit several areas around the tents. Agnian soldiers laid on the floor. The group stopped before the erected barriers (only to the side, the invisible 'door' had no barriers) to observe the situation.</p>
<p>Riku: "Everybody flat on ground..." He started running toward the one nearest, the group followed thereafter. They gathered around him/her to inspect his/her situation.{{footnote: Translator couldn't see the face, nor even the head with helmets!}}</p>
<p>Sena: "At least they're breathing."{{footnote: The girl whom stood behind Sena was <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Alexandria">Alexandria</a>, translator think... If you'd remember Taion asked which path to take before entering the desert, the other path was 'Agnian territory', and yes, it was Colony Iota's territory, Alexandria's the commander.}}</p>
<p>Manana: "Friends all OK?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Looks like they're just passed out."</p>
<p>Noah: "Even so... There's cause for concern." He looked at Lanz, whom nodded to him. They both, together with Riku, ran into the distance, we don't know what they do, but translator guessed they went to inspect other soldiers.</p>
<p>Taion stood by himself, confounded by the situation. Eunie and Mio approached him, with Eunie attracting his attention, "Taion!"</p>
<p>"...Uh?" He turned around and faced them.</p>
<p>"We need to find the real commander, right?"</p>
<p>Mio assured him, "We'll keep an eye on this place. You go and make sure Commander Isurd is safe."</p>
<p>"Wait, but..." He tried refuting unconsciously before his logical mind overrides his unconscious, "...No, sorry, you're right. I'll go now, be back soon!" They watched him off into the distance, Mio doing her appreciation stance.</p>
<p>As if everything was as before, he had no trouble finding the commander's camp; or maybe it's just too obvious. Isurd and two soldiers, one of the latter not wearing a helmet, laid on the (seemingly) carpeted floor encircled the table. Taion exclaimed, perhaps relieved to see him, "Commander Isurd!!!" He ran and knelt by his side, "...It's good to see you."</p>
<hr />
<p>Laying on a bed, Isurd eyes squinted as his eye muscles relaxed, opened. Translator assumed the place an infirmary, with beds lying on opposite sides like in the real hospital, a path in the middle. The ground was soil, no tiles. There is a tent above, and some foldable 'walls' behind each beds. The tent was unoccupied, only Isurd and Taion. Raising his head while his body laid flat on the bed, his hand on his chest, he turned to the guy sitting beside him, "Taion..." He looked at him without speaking for a moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Taion explained the situation to Isurd, whom was sitting up. The group gathered around, sitting on the beds or standing (and Nopons standing on the beds).</p>
<p>"So that's what happened..." He put his head on his forehead, trying hard to recall but failed. "I'm sorry. I don't remember a thing. Except for that... Consul's silhouette..."</p>
<p>He looked at Taion, asked, "Did I... say anything to you? I didn't..." then turned to the rest of the group, "say something... hurtful, did I...?" His tone seemed on-the-verge of tears.</p>
<p>A few seconds of silence, Taion, to not hurt his feelings, answered in a high tone, as if to assure him, "<em>Not at all...</em> You were your usual self, Commander. Our pride and joy, the same as always."</p>
<p>Eunie squinted his eyes, "Taion..." The willingness to conceal a painful fact and make someone's day, to bite one own's tongue and no one else.</p>
<p>Isurd looked into his eyes for a while, before looking down, his eyes closed, I see... I'm sorry." Then, he brought out something from his pocket that took Taion by surprise,</p>
<p>"I-Is that...?!"</p>
<p>Nimue's stopwatch. He looked at it, reminisced their shared past, as he shared his thoughts of her and him, "Nimue... She always cared so much about you. You possess... an acuity that sets you apart. You'll be an elite, head and shoulders above the likes of us. Nimue... She wouldn't stop going on about you."</p>
<p>Taion shakily breathed out as he listened to him sharing his emotions, eyes fixated on the gadget. The commander raised his head to look at him, "So someone called you a coward? Nonsense." Taion probably tried to hide his tears from him, turned to the other side as Isurd continued, "Considerate's what you are. Perhaps to a fault. You heeded a comrade's opinion. Isn't that right?" He was trying hard to hold his tears from leaking.</p>
<p>Looking back at the stopwatch, "Here's another thing she mentioned: That if you led us... If we could gain victory through your kindness, she'd have loved to see it." His iris constricted as he was reminded of Nimue's final moments, her look, her hopes, passed on to him. He closed his eyes to shed tears, clenched his fist.</p>
<p>Isurd stood up in front of Taion and handed over the stopwatch, "Even if it's too much, it should be yours to carry." Taion looked up at him, to which he nodded in assurance. He took two steps forward, received the stopwatch into his hands.</p>
<p>"And if you keep it safe... someday... I'd like you to go visit her."</p>
<p>"Huh? How can I... visit...?" Taion reflexively, shockingly, asked, the second tone softer as his mind figured it may just be a dream that can't be fulfilled.</p>
<p>Anyways, he attentively listened as Isurd continued, "At the Cadensia frontier, beyond the Farlaine Underpass, there's a place where Saffronias bloom. Nimue always loved their flowers... And one of them was especially brilliant... I'd like you to bury it there." As he returned his look on the stopwatch, he groaned in pain, heart pain, and clenched his fist around the gadget.</p>
<p>"That'll show her, beyond all doubt, your victory through kindness." Taion closed his eyes, brought the gadget to his chest, and embraced.</p>
<hr />
<p>Taion seemed to leave the commander's tent, the group was waiting for him outside, Mio asking, "How's Commander Isurd?"</p>
<p>"It sounds like he's eager to jump back into work. I do wish he'd rest up first, but... That's the kind of man he is."</p>
<p>Sena: "...Ah, um, good to hear he's feeling well, at least..."</p>
<p>Noah added: "The other soldiers are waking up, too."</p>
<p>Taion nodded, "Very interesting."</p>
<p>Lanz nudged, "Someone should bring them up to speed, but we're just outsiders, after all... This is your manor, right? You should do the honors and fill everyone in."</p>
<p>"That is being taken care of. Commander Isurd is going to get the colony troops back in line shortly."</p>
<p>Eunie: "OK... So, it sounds like it's fine for us to just walk around like normal then."</p>
<p>Noah and Mio, standing beside each other, turned and look at each others' eyes. They nodded to each other in assurance as Noah voiced out, "On that note, there's something I'd like to check."</p>
<p>Mio added, "Taion, will you come along?"</p>
<p>"...Huh...? Sure. Where are we going?"</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, replied, "Out of Colony Lambda."</p>
<hr />
<p>Encircled by the remains of mud puppets, Noah and Mio played the melody. Blue moats rose from the remains{{footnote: Again, rendering error, please see second video.}} Agnian soldiers gathered behind them, watching them sending them off. Sena, Lanz, Riku, and Manana too, but they weren't standing with the other soldiers. They were facing the direction of the bridge, in front of a waterfall.</p>
<p>Soldiers did the Agnian welcoming stance{{footnote: Clench your right hand into a fist and put it by your heart.}} as they sent their colleagues off. Others too sad just stood still, shaking their heads sometimes.</p>
<p>"They were literal clods, man. Nobody's actually died. Who you doin' that for?" Lanz, arms crossed, wasn't convinced of their acts.</p>
<p>"Lanz got no tact. Do too... is about... atoning." Riku lectured, as if he knows a lot about it.</p>
<p>Sena was equally confused, "Riku, whatcha sayin' there?"</p>
<p>Riku recalled the same question he directed at Noah earlier, while they were walking out of Lambda.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah: "Why are we seeing them off? I know they were only hollow vessels... But ultimately, <em>we</em> chose to fight... and kill them... And nothing can change that fact. Even if there's no one to actually see off, we have to atone for that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"In nutshell..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Oh, I see..."</p>
<p>"Atonement, huh...?" Lanz looked up at the two, unsure if he's convinced or not. Taion was far behind Lanz and Sena, watching the scene too.</p>
<p>Eunie voice appeared from behind as she walked to join him, "Hey, is Isurd OK with this? It's kinda... "</p>
<p>"Yeah!... He doesn't mind."</p>
<p>"Allll right... Guess you're all weirdos. Still, kinda strange. I wonder when it all started..."</p>
<p>"I couldn't tell you exactly when, but, I would surmise it started out as a kind of process for the upkeep of the world."</p>
<p>"Sounds like a crazy kind of process. This is all going way over my head." She crossed her arms.</p>
<p>Taion provided a cogent reason, "Quite simple actually. It gives a sense of security. Lets you think your dead friends are looking out for you from above. Alleviating feelings of guilt, and of loss. That's how I understand it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, OK, but... Ain't there plenty of people who don't care about that?" She recalled how Noah used to atone for dead Agnian and Kevesi soldiers after the battle with the Dirt Rank in Colony 9. Soldiers stepped on other corpses, levnises trampled their way through.</p>
<p>"<em><strong>What matters is that it is there. You don't need to pay attention. You don't need to do anything. But the way it is designed, if you think about it, it just works.</strong></em> We are told our life is born from the Queen, and to the Queen it returns. However, that's only if you make it to your Homecoming. But what of the others...? What of those who fall on the battlefield? Nobody knows. Where do they go? Seeing motes rise into the sky serves to dispel any unease. You end up believing, well... They're going <em>somewhere</em>. "</p>
<p>Eunie looked up to him, prompted for more, "But where is... 'somewhere'? The Queen's place?"</p>
<p>He looked back at her, "No clue..."</p>
<p>"You what, mate? That's kinda noncommittal for you." She put her hands behind her heads.</p>
<p>"Disappointed?" He teased back, looking at her.</p>
<p>"Nah, not fussed." Together, they embraced the moments the moats floated into the sky, grief over the dead while enjoying the silence, as the melody was coming to an end.</p>
<hr />
<p>Slightly outside Colony Lambda's garrison, but still under the shade, Manana stood on a box, preparing the dishes. Sena was busy chopping some ingredients, seemingly. Mio stirred the cooking soup a little, before taking a ladle to taste it. They were about 1 o'clock from the bonfire.</p>
<p>After blowing it a few times, she took a sip, "Urg, ahh..." The content was still too hot for her tongue. Manana and Sena smiled at her{{footnote: Instead of asking "Are you okay?".}}. It seemed like they were cooking tomato soup. There were also some cabbages on the table.</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone sounded from behind, "You lot, why're you making that stuff out here?" They turned to face him. It was Lanz. "Colony's got a perfectly good kitchen."</p>
<p>Far away behind Lanz, near the edge of the shade, Noah was practicing his sword. There were water falling from above at the edge, shrouding Lambda from outside view. He turned to watch the conversations.</p>
<p>Mio, embarrassedly chuckled, replied, "Out of commission, apparently." Then, folded her arms, "<em>Somebody</em> made a real mess of the place."</p>
<p>Sena felt nervous, looked back at her, "Wh... Hold on a sec!"</p>
<p>"Sorry, Mio..." Lanz apologized for unknown reasons, then walked away. The girls watched him off.</p>
<p>Sena stutteringly tried to explain away the nervousness, "I-... If we hadn't done what we did, chances are we would've all been dead by now! Uh, th-that's why we...!"</p>
<p>Mio frivolously{{footnote: took it lightly.}} assured her, "It's all right, everyone understand why. You were really brave, Sena."</p>
<p>"Uh... really? You're not just saying that?"</p>
<p>"N-Nope!"</p>
<p>At another location. Riku, his uncanny laughter raised goosebumps, "Meh-heh-hehhh! This real thrill of travel! Excitement moun-TINGGGG!!!" He was facing his toolbox, which contained a Mondo, a circular disc with a metal outer ring, glowing blue inner ring, and matted black filled circle inside; a cup with handle; an empty Ether cylinder.</p>
<p>Noah was about 2 o'clock to his direction, very near, estranged at his gleefulness, but observed without disturbance. The two turned their attention to Lanz, approaching, "Hah... Seriously... Nopon can be a bit too easygoing." he walked off immediately after he commented. Riku just watched him off, seemingly not offended.</p>
<p>He walked away, muscle tensed, emotionally stodgy, when Noah sounded from behind. "Everyone deals with things in their own way." They had their backs facing each other, Noah holding his sword up.</p>
<p>"Is that right? And why are <em>you</em> acting all normal?" He turned to him, "It was Joran! He was... He looked just like his old self!"</p>
<p>Noah put his sword down, turned to face him, stodgily, "I suppose... you think you're the reason for that, do you?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"In that case, I'm tell you to drop it <em>right now</em>. So Joran turned up. That alone isn't so bad."</p>
<p>Pugnaciously, he rebutted, "'Course it is!"</p>
<p>"Figuring out why it happened... That's what we should do!"</p>
<p>"Whaddya mean... 'why it happened'...?"</p>
<p>He turned to his right and walked a few steps, with Lanz's eyes on him, as he continued, "The reason we became Ouroboros... The reason the world looks like this. It's all connected... I'm sure of it..."</p>
<p>Lanz, superciliously, "Or maybe you just want it that way."</p>
<p>Noah accepted it, turned to face him, "Better than being stuck in the past."</p>
<p>"Uhhh..." Lanz felt hearthurt. His head down, announced "I won't... I can't... <strong>I'll NEVER! SNUFFING FORGET!!!</strong>" Then, he walked away towards the waterfall, all tensed. Noah watched him off.</p>
<p>Then, he looked to his right, where the Ferronis had fallen, thought to himself, "<em>There shouldn't be any life in those bodies... But the motes still rose... So that means... I knew it.</em>"</p>
<p>He brought out his flute as he recalled.</p>
<hr />
<h4 id="start-of-noahs-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-noahs-memories">(Start of Noah's Memories)</a></h4>
<p>In the evening sun, transporting levnises parked on an elevated platform; soldiers tiredly walked around the battlefield littered with levnises wreckages;  some levnises drove down a hill. On a platform below the tallest point of the hill, Noah stood overlooking the battlefield. Someone sounded from his right, he turned to him.</p>
<p>"The dead don't think anything. They don't speak. But... survivors speak for them. To celebrate their life... and death." It was the guy whom he looked up on during the Homecoming when they were younger. He walked past him, Noah's eye fixated on him, as he stopped at the edge of the ledge.</p>
<p>"That's why... I'm here." He brought out his flute and played a melody; the melody seemed to differ from the usual Kevesi tune.</p>
<p>As blue moats rose from the corpses, both Kevesi and Agnians, transporting levnises fully boarded retracted their legs and zoomed into the distance; war levnises drove on the ground away in similar directions{{footnote: Air route and land route differs slightly.}} Several tired soldiers effetely pushed their bodies forward, a step after another, no attention to care about their surroundings.  Noah just watched the moats, listening to his melody, quietly.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-noahs-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-noahs-memories">(End of Noah's Memories)</a></h4>
<p>He removed his glance on his flute and looked into the distance; Lanz smaller and smaller in his view, talking to himself, "Lanz... <em>We</em> are still alive..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Consider the barriers from the colony entrance to be its 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock; to it's 11 o'clock, there was a huge rock several meters tall, and an Agnian levnis parked tens of meters away to its left. Lanz was sitting behind the rock{{footnote: Seen from the colony entrance, it is 'behind'.}}; Eunie walking towards him from behind the parked Levnis. She commented while she was still walking, "It ain't like you to sulk like this."</p>
<p>"Piss off..."</p>
<p>"Noah bust your chops?"</p>
<p>"Urg..." He faced away from her.</p>
<p>With a joking look, "Mmm-hmm... <strong>Maybe</strong> not, but I'm getting warmer." Then, she dropped and sat to his left.</p>
<p>Lanz sneered at her, "Eunie, <em>for sparks' sake, read the room</em>."</p>
<p>Hushed, she replied, "Hard pass. Look Lanz, I was there too."</p>
<p>"Ahhh!" Lanz whimpered.</p>
<p>"No one's asking you to forget. Noah's just saying, move on."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah, Noah</strong>. He's always a step ahead, eh?"</p>
<p>"You know he's an off-seer. He's closer to it all than we are. To the ones who're gone..."</p>
<p>In a softer tone, "Being left, it... It ain't easy."</p>
<p>"I know. Still... I don't wanna disappear."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as Lanz considered her feelings, and relinquished his current feelings, "Yeah... Yeah, you're right. Not like... we can afford to go just yet." They looked at nature; mist blew from one side to another by wind. Some teeth-like rock pillars shrouded by black fog. To the far side, there were other pillars that looked like elephant's tusk; together they made a structure that resembled a temple.</p>
<hr />
<p>'Lives' flowing into a Kevesi Flame Clock, half full, the Ferronis head shaped like a... jellyfish? Agnian soldiers fall as Kevesi soldiers and levnises marched forward. There was a new type of levnis: one that with four legs, two swords, and stood <em>really tall</em>. The center of its grip, capable of firing dispersed beams in in a conical shape wherever it points. The soldiers roared as they marched towards victory.</p>
<p>In contrast, Agnian soldiers were mostly corpses on the floor; its Flame Clock barely alight. One of the Agnian soldier, suffering heavy injuries, struggled to walk away from the battlefield; each steps was suffering. A Kevesi soldier holding a blade ran after him, stopped a few meters behind him.</p>
<p>As if noticing his existence, the Agnian turned his head to him. Then, "Yaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" he dashed towards the Agnian, whom withdrew his dual blades as he got near and slashed an X in front, "Gyah!" The Kevesi soldier jumped before he slashed him, holding his swords over his head, and smashed down on the ground. Their backs were facing each other for a second before they stood up in synchrony, the Agnian suffered fatal injury, dropped his blades, let out a 'vomiting blood' sound, and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Panting heavily, he turned to confirm the Agnian died. Upon seeing 'lives' arisen from his corpse, he raised his sword high, called out, "The Agnian commander... bites the dust!"</p>
<p>Unfortunately, an unmasked Agnian soldier with crystals growing around her ears, some zig-zag cyan lines similar to Isurd growing from her ears down to her body, shoulder-long hair, blue iris, ran towards the Kevesi from behind and stabbed him as he turned, while shouting, "<strong>I'LL KILL YOU</strong>!!!" In a weeping tone, she looked at him, continued, "He had two months to go... And you mudders killed him...!"</p>
<p>She stabbed deeper into his chest, he made 'vomiting blood' sound, stiffly fall to his back, sheathing his blade in the process, and landed on his back. The woman watched 'lives' rose from his corpses a few seconds later as she took two steps backward.</p>
<p>As she grief, bullet shot her right on her forehead; her last words before she fell on her backs was "Seguy... Forgive me..."{{footnote: In a calm tone.}}. Lying to her side beside the Agnian Commander's corpse, Flames in her Iris died down and concluded the battle.</p>
<p>This scene was replicated in the Moebius projector room. As the screen turned blank, we focus on a 16-sided roulette, with 3 concentric rings that divided it into 3 layers. The most inner layer (a.k.a. the 4th layer) don't count, as it was just a white axle. Metallic figurine pawns were put on some of the segments; those that had pawns standing lit up; and some conquered an 'area' had the whole section lit up even if there weren't standing pawn on it. The pawns had different shapes, representing soldiers wielding blade, lance, staffs. One of the soldier pawn laid horizontally, its cyan light dim out.</p>
<p>"All dead, all done!"</p>
<p>"Ngah!"</p>
<p>Two Consul, one thin, one buff, sat by the table with the roulette. Here, we could see more pawns outside the roulette, and there was a dark glass emanating 'lives' from it in the middle of the roulette, floating above the axle.</p>
<p>"Ahhh... Did you hear those dulcet death throes, though? 'Seguy... Forgive me...' Forgive what? Why's she apologizing? Uch, humans." This Consul whom spoke had a very tall prism helmet, with two hose that stuck from outside into his nose, seemingly oxygen pipes. And he sounded like a duck.</p>
<p>"Tch... Such useless pawns." This female Consul had a regular bird-shaped helmet with some 'wings' stuck to her top.</p>
<p>"So I win then...?" He grabbed the glass and drank the 'lives' in it; the Moebius symbol in his Iris glowed as he finished gulping them down.</p>
<p>They were sitting on the stage, just before the projector. On the front few rows, Z sat near the middle pathway, while the golden-mask with an X-shape on his chest stood on the pathway, a step behind him, watching. He looked down on these two Consuls, "Tch..."</p>
<p>Nauseating... Might we infer from that, <strong>N</strong>?"</p>
<p>"Is there naught here but these vulgar pleasures?"</p>
<p>"Hah... I see why you would feel that way. But, you have not the luxury." More about Z: white long hair, tall sharp-tipped ears, purple lines on his face like dendrites, green-cyan{{footnote: RGB = #788983}} skin, and purple smoke escaping the two dendrites directly above his eyes, orange-reddish iris.</p>
<p>"Say what you mean." He turned to look at him.</p>
<p>"Pleasures and sorrows, meetings and partings, their roots are the same... Tolerance of existence is at the heart of them all."</p>
<p>"You want me to frolic with them?"</p>
<p>"You shall find there's no such thing as luxury in this world. Everything buds from but a single thought. That you yourself are here... is proof definite thereof."</p>
<p>"Hmph..." He looked away, unconvinced.</p>
<p>Z continued, "You need not understand. You can simply remain as you are... That is enough."</p>

<p>Beams flared through the air; 'lives' floated near the ground. Agnian levnises retreated to under the foot of a Ferronis, with shades of dark red. Flames flared the battlefield. Inside a room, probably the Ferronis control center, Cammuravi, his arms folded, eyes, closed, meditated amidst the seemingly dire situation.</p>
<p>Kevesi levnises and soldiers marched forwards, pushing their frontline. Flames blasted at Cammuravi's Ferronis does not deal any visible damage. The Kevesi had no difficulty finding their target amidst thick cloud of dust. Some Agnian soldiers exchanged blows with the Kevesi; all fall to the ground, turn into corpses, and 'lives' floated off their remains.</p>
<p>The hand-wheel levnises seemingly modified, had two pointed structure behind which fired cannons towards the frontline.</p>
<p>On a balcony, Cammuravi's Ferronis directly facing it from afar. The various 'lives' that filled the battlefield like virus infection{{footnote: Seriously, if you'd played Oxygen Not Included and turn on the view for virus on the air, you'd know what one said.}}. The Kevesi commander stood on it overlooking the field, with a Consul standing to his 7 o'clock. Lives' were filling the Flame Clock stuck on the jelly-fish head ferronis, which had probably 12 holes that illuminates red on its 'mouth'. "It's... I-it's...! It's rising! We're getting more life!"</p>
<p>As he spoke, his Flame Clock rose from quarterly filled to half filled, "This is Colony Delta? That's Smoldering Cammuravi...! His valor, it's the stuff of legends, but..." Cammuravi's Flame Clock drained near zero as Agnian soldiers fall; his confidence skyrocketed even before it was over, "We can win! We're gonna make it! Consul, Sir!" The cone-hat cork-head Consul watched his excitement and greed ballooned without making a single remark.</p>
<p>His jelly-fish head Ferronis, one-fifth the height of Cammuravi's Ferronis, had a gatling gun attached to its back. It fired several shots from down to up at Cammuravi's Ferronis; black smoke rose where it was hit, and it started drifting backwards as Newton's Third Law work out. "Right! All troops! Full advance, and don't let up! Don't let a single life slip from your grasp!!!"</p>
<p>Cammuravi was still meditating, his hands crossed. The previously dark screen made of hexagonal tiles now lit up, displaying real time view of the battlefield surrounding the Ferronis. Some green triangulation points came into existence and finally locked on the joints of the Kevesi Ferronis, triangulation point turning yellow upon locking; two at the bottom of the Ferronis's feet, two at the joints of the feet to the torso, one at the gatling gun, and one on the head.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes, his left iris blinked for a moment. The Ferronis came alive; steam blew out from its armpits raised it mid-air. It's chest-plates split and released more steam; it's Flame Clock tilted upwards to release the "feet" that was sheathed behind it. Then, it dropped back onto the ground, soil spattered on the point of contact. It had a wing-like structure floating behind it now, with two broadsword-like structure that pointed upwards. In the middle was the Ferronis's weapon, a spear.</p>
<p>The Kevesi commander was taken aback by the ferronis transformation, "Huh? Wh-what the?! What's... that Ferronis?!" As the wing constricted, the spear shot straight up into mid-air, fell back down, and caught on its arm. As the tip of the spear lighted aflame, Cammuravi took the honor and slashed from right to left, bringing dusty flames towards the Kevesi soldiers. Strong winds prevented them from advancing. Then, he made another slash from left to right, the surrounding air heated and burned with a fiery shockwave traversing the direction of the Kevesi's Ferronis, before it pointed the spear towards the Ferronis.</p>
<p>"Listen here... You've done well to come this far! But now... Smoldering Cammuravi... takes the field." He did a few slash, swoop, and caress his spear, to show it off.</p>
<p>How high his confidence ballooned, how deep the trench he fell. "No... No way! He let us think we had them pinned... But really... we were the ones... that were trapped?!" Cammuravi's Ferronis advanced the battlefield, together with the remaining Agnian soldiers, Kevesi soldiers were now the ones that can't stand a single hit. (There were no Agnian levnises seen, though. )</p>
<p>Cammuravi continued to waved his spear as his Ferronis advanced towards the Kevesi's Ferronis. "S-spark this! Everyone, pull back! Full retreat! We gotta leg it before-!" Too late! The Consul watched his failure, turned and teleported away before Cammuravi shove his spear through the neck of the Ferronis, detaching it as black smoke rose into the air.{{foornote: Perspective-wise, or maybe because of the transformation, Cammuravi's ferronis is now two-third the height of the Kevesi's Ferronis. Plus, the 'wings' didn't follow where he moved; perhaps he left it behind?}} "Ahhhh!"</p>
<p>The remaining 'lives' from the battlefield were absorbed into Cammuravi's ferronis, as he climbed onto the shoulder (above the Flame Clock) and just look forward, unsure what he's thinking of, nor what he felt.</p>
<hr />
<p>Seemingly in a jail room; the huge barred windows high up on the several-storey-tall room; stars filled the night. Cammuravi sat in the middle of the room; starlight lit the ground through the window. Footsteps sounded behind him as he voiced out, "Just who are you? Perhaps a guard? Perhaps not."</p>
<p>"Well, well. 'Smoldering Cammuravi'... Your name... is no mere affectation." N sounded from behind, looking at him through the jail door, stopped before it. Cammuravi stood up and turned to face him.</p>
<p>"A Consul...? No... You're..." Before he could finish, the Moebius symbol lit up on N's right Iris.</p>

<p>Outside Lambda, the group gathered together, where the Ferronis and the waterfall behind the scene. Eunie was playing with the tip of her wings, Lanz stretching. Manana jumped and fluttered as she happily spoke with Noah. With his hands at the back of his head, Lanz announced to Noah and Mio, "Ready to go!"</p>
<p>Noah: "OK, then let's go."</p>
<p>Riku asked, "How we go on from here?"</p>
<p>Eunie complaint, "I got completely turned around in all those sparking tunnels, and then the joyride down those rapids... I've got to say, I have absolutely no sparking clue where we are." She probably didn't like the last part of their journey, folding her arms together.</p>
<p>Taion flipped his hair as he backed her up, "You needn't worry on that count. Commander Isurd provided us with the necessary topographical data."</p>
<p>"Oh, nice! Legend." She was amazed!</p>
<p>As he transferred the data to their Iris, he continued, "All the water that runs from the Urayan mountains makes for difficult terrain. Actually, rather than constantly checking the data and explaining myself, I think it'd be better if I just tell you where to go..."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Yeah, sounds good. Lead the way!"</p>
<p>Sena seconded, "Totes! We have every faith in you, Taion!"</p>
<p>"This is the bottom of the waterfall. Let's see if we can get to the middle level first."</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Should we aim to get above Colony Lambda?"</p>
<p>"Basically, yes." He looked into the distance where the bridge we saw from earlier when fighting Joran. There was a platform at the end of the L-shaped bridge, connected to the shallow water, sloped upwards. "To get to the middle levels, we'll need to head up and around."</p>
<p>"Got it."</p>
<p>Manana punched her wings into the air, "Departure time!" Lanz took the lead as the group followed. Mio fell behind as she met with Taion and asked,</p>
<p>"Did you get to say everything you wanted to say to Commander Isurd in the end?"</p>
<p>"...More or less."</p>
<p>In her appreciation stance, she felt relieved, "Well... OK, that's good." Taion facial expression seemed more regret than relieved, though. As he turned to look behind Mio, where the Ferronis stood, perhaps it brought back memories for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, turning back towards Mio, he urged, "Let's go." Mio watched him walked a few steps before following behind...</p>
<hr />
<p>(Somewhere, at some time, on their path)</p>
<p>The group withdrew their blades as a purple winged dragon, four horns with blue carvings on them, blocked their way. There were also illuminated blue carving on its feet. ITs tails were strong and spiky; it's wings, stretched out, bony... It roared at them, its tongue jiggered as it roared.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Some time into the battle)</p>
<p>Lanz's Ouroboros was overheating, with an emergency sound, as it dragged backwards towards where Riku and Manana were hiding. It punched its hands into the ground to increase drag. The dragon was still standing, rotate its head from left to right as it roared out, so loud it released shockwaves into the air.</p>
<p>"Would you just... <strong>DIE</strong> already!" He ran towards the dragon while it was busy roaring, and punched upwards on its chin, decapacitating it immediately, dust and soil splattered around where it fell. One side of the surrounding were tall cliff walls.</p>
<p>"Huh..." Lanz puffed out, relieved that it had finally gone. His ouroboros weren't the only one overheating; we could see Noah's Ouroboros behind overheating as well. Steam were evaporating from their Ouroboros. "Ahh... Finally..." As Lanz tried to wiped his sweat, or perhaps scratched his head, it burned him, "Ugh... Ugh...!" He immediately cancelled the Interlink; the group followed.</p>
<p>On the other side of the cliff wall was a pond where water falls to; we could see the high tech building and another waterfall far behind. Scratching his head, Lanz asked, "Hey, can we do something about this sparking noise?"</p>
<p>Eunie and Taion walked up to join him, with Eunie equally had no solution for it, "How would I know? Just cancel the Interlink or something, I guess." She folded her arms, while Taion folded one arm, another hand clenched softly and put in front of his mouth, elbow rested on his folded arm, in his thinking position.</p>
<p>Noah looked to the ground as his arms folded, thinking and reported his findings, "It only starts after an extended period after our bodies start to heat up."</p>
<p>Taion added, "To me it sounds like a warning. For something."</p>
<p>Mio: "A warning... Mmm... What do you think'll happen if we leave it?" The group was eager to know.</p>
<p>"Huh...? I don't have much desire to find out." He pushed his glasses up as he confidently replied.</p>
<p>Sena turned to Lanz, prompted, "Think it's something... dangerous?"</p>
<p>To which Lanz replied, "Well it can't be anything fun. You expect balloons and confetti with that noise?"</p>
<p>"Maybe not."</p>
<p>Noah, his palms held out in front of him as he looked at them, "Hmm..." We don't know what he saw.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the dark Moebius theatre, lights lit up as Moebius arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>The female chef-hat shaped helmet spoke first, "Aww, too bad, J!"</p>
<p>Joran, his helmet wore back up, stared at her without saying anything.</p>
<p>The fat moebius, fan-shaped extended from his eyebrow, always partnering with the female, teased, "Hnnnnnngh! Looks like that backfired on you, didn't it? <em>Better be prepared for the consequences.</em>"</p>
<p>"Really? I was only interested in putting in an appearance. You're making it sound like I took some huge risk." He folded his arms, patiently questioned the fat guy's assumption.</p>
<p>"Ahhh, come on now, guys." The moebius with earrings on his horn, cow-shaped head, probably the moebius they first fought in the end of Chapter 1, "J's been on the bench all this time. I get why he might be a little stimulated by a bit of drama."</p>
<p>J put his arms behind his head, backed his explanation, "Well it was pretty dramatic, I'll give you that. Heheheheheheheh..."</p>
<p>Another female sounded voice, with two 'throngs' upwards like the mouth of beetles, commented but wasn't very pleased herself, "Hah. You seem pleased with yourself."</p>
<p>"P... O..." A female voiced Moebius joined in and cut any replies; her helmet like butterfly wings stretched behind her head. The fat guy and his partner turned to face her as she continued, "N wants to see you."</p>
<p>The female voiced, unsure it was <strong>P</strong> or <strong>O</strong>, replied, "Does he now?"</p>
<p>The fat guy, as if tasted delicious food: "Hmm! Is it our turn to shine?" He put his hands around his waist, guessed.</p>
<p>"I don't know. I've got zero idea what's going through his brain, sometimes." She shook her head instead.</p>
<p>"Not even you?" The cow-helmet asked, hands folded.</p>
<p>To which she replied, "I'm sure <strong>M</strong> could tell you. Not that she's shown herself recently."</p>
<p>"Hmmm....." He didn't seemed dare to reply anything to that.</p>
<p>"What could it be?" The female among the pair considered the possibilities, "I do hope it's something fun. Let's be off, O." Ok, so <em>she is P, and the fat guy, O</em>.</p>
<p>He turned to look at her, "Righty-O!" They both teleported away immediately, turning into purple speckles. The rest of the group watched as the light beams that shone on them disappeared one by one (though purple particles didn't evaporate if they had teleported after the beams went off).</p>
<p>J stood for a while in the theatre alone, gave his wishes, "Have a good one! Heheheheheh...." and went offline.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group stood where they fought the dragon before, but nearer towards the pond; mist enshrouded our vision where the water falls. The ground was purely soil, no undergrowth; and a tree with green leaves was at the distance, some distance to the left of the waterfall. Mio was in her appreciation stance, probably appreciating the day. Sena looked into the distance; to her 11 o'clock, Lanz was stretching.{{footnote: As usual, we omitted the 7th character -- <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Zeon">Zeon</a>, new Commander of Colony 9, after the previous one step down after Noah's leave.}} Noah watched them, then turned to his left. Eunie was playing with the tip of her wings, Riku and Manana unsure what they were doing, and Taion thinking, one arm around his chest, another rested on it, putting his fingertips on his glasses.</p>
<p>Then, he turned to Mio, prompted, "Are you tired?"</p>
<p>She turned to face him, "A bit. That last monster was really something. But I can deal with it." Then, she looked towards Sena, whom turned to face her earlier, and nodded, which Sena did her <strong>encouraging stance</strong> and... encouraged...</p>
<p>Taion sounded from behind: "Yes, well. In that last battle we all overused our Ouroboros abilities... I want to avoid Interlinking again for a while."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with him. "...Good shout."</p>
<p>Lanz asked, "Couldn't we keep going, just without Interlinking?"</p>
<p>"That comes with its own risks. Small, but risks nonetheless. I'm just asking you to keep it in mind."</p>
<p>"Sure, whatever..." Then he just put his hands behind his head, meh...</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Shall we find somewhere to have a quick rest, then?"</p>
<p>Taion immediately check the map in his Iris, and replied, "It appears there should be a good place to take a break up ahead."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with his decisions, "We'll regroup once we get there."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Roger that, boss!"</p>
<p>They place they mentioned had to cross the lake; some trees grew at the edge where water falls to a lower level. At the other side of the lake, there was a path that could take them to higher platforms. Far in the distance, there was more waterfall, and the teeth-like rocky structure enshrouded with black fog we last seen when Eunie and Lanz were reminiscing about Joran's reappearance. Taion took the lead as others followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Water falling sounded from behind. Taion was at the edge of the platform. A bald tree to his left, and the teeth-like structure to his 11 o'clock, far away. Lush green grass ankle-high carpeted the floor where he stood. Behind him and upwards, we saw cliff walls, and a tree that grew horizontally, it's roots on the cliff wall. At the lower part, an S-shaped path could bring them to higher platforms. The waterfall where they came from was 90° to the left, including the lake and the water that falls to a lower distance, its edge forming a semicircle.</p>
<p>He was holding on to Nimue's gadget. One thing to note, the gadget had a cap that can be opened and closed; obviously, you opened it to check the time, and closed it to 'protect' external damage in case you drop it. Currently, it's 'closed'.</p>
<p>He was reminiscing as Mio sounded from behind, cutting his thoughts, "Ah, there you are! I don't want to mither, but... Aren't you on tent duty today?" Taion first took down the gadget from attracting unwanted attention before he turned to face them. Noah and Mio were walking up to him.</p>
<p>"Oh! I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll head back and-" He didn't manage to finish his words. Noah was closing his eyes and smiling at him. Turning to Mio, she did the same. He was confused, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"It's all finished." She remarked.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Folding his hand around his breast, Noah added, "We already packed it all up."</p>
<p>"Hngh. Then what was the point of telling me? Don't you have better things to do?" He pushed his glasses up in annoyance.</p>
<p>"Hey, you owe us one." He tucked his hands by his waist; and Mio nodded, agreed with him.</p>
<p>"Urghphhhhhhuh..."</p>
<p>"<em>I'm just joking!</em> Are you OK?"</p>
<p>He remained stodgy, "What do you mean, OK?"</p>
<p>Mio expressively nudged, "These last few days... It's been a lot, right?"</p>
<p>"That's why you're concerned?"</p>
<p>She nodded, "Yep! <em>You got it</em>. We were worried. Your problems are our problems." As she folded her arms with more concerned intonation, "<em><strong>Just because someone says they're doing OK, doesn't mean everything actually is fine with them.</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Annoyed and impatient, he turned his head one round and pushed his glasses, all the while commenting, "<strong>You know</strong>, there's a word for people like you."</p>
<p>"Hm?" Mio eyes opened.</p>
<p>"Busybodies, all of you."</p>
<p>She set out to encourage, but was denied being appreciated, "Now Taion, that is <em>completely uncalled for</em>!" Though, she doesn't fussed, her last few words in a more jokingly tone.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hah!</strong>" He replied to her joking tone with a laughter, albeit a stiff one.</p>
<p>That confused her: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Putting his arms on his waist, he remarked, "You two really must be bored stiff. Good grief."</p>
<p>Noah put his arms around his chest as he empathized with him, "Everyone needs to let off steam."</p>
<p>Raising his tone before snapping and giving up, "<strong>Is my life that entertaining to you?</strong> Pah... <em>I'll allow it.</em>" He can't jettison them, can he? As he opened up Nimue's gadget in front of them, the two took notice.</p>
<p>Mio was reminded what she saw when Isurd handed it to him, "Hey, that watch..."</p>
<p>Taion nodded his head, then continued, "Our lifetimes run for ten years only. But... this pocket watch has already lived for longer than that, by being passed, from Nimue's hands to mine." As his memories lingered back when they first met, fighting Eunie, helping Lanz, listening to Guernica's final words, he continued in a lively tone, "What Guernica said to us on that battlefield. I don't know what you made of it exactly, but frankly, to me it was a load of nonsense. <strong>Not even enough to push us together!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Noah's eyelids constricted a little as he heard his last sentence, his thoughts inscrutable. Nonetheless, he didn't cut him off.</p>
<p>Changing to a lower tone, he continued, "But that's changed. If Nimue's life is represented by her dreams, then in remembering those, I carry her life with me. Perhaps now... I can give a purpose to my life. She'd live on, if I were to pass her dreams on to others... Right?"</p>
<p>"Heavy..." Mio softly commented.</p>
<p>He quickly grabbed the watch and put it down while back facing them, snapped, "Also, I've done some thinking."  With his heads slightly tilted up, eyes closed, as if he returned to his thinkings, "If I had just, say, ten more years... No, even five. With just a bit of borrowed time... how many more memories could I fit... inside this little pocket watch...?" He looked back down at the stopwatch.</p>
<p>Noah lightly prompted, "And that's... why you're here now?"</p>
<p>"That's half of it." He turned back to face him.</p>
<p>Mio was curious, asking for more, "What's the other half, then?"</p>
<p>Looking at her from the tip of his eyes, he suddenly stuttered to her question,  "Oh, uh, well..." As he paused, Mio's eyes glanced back at his, tilting her head slightly with curiosity. They exchanged glance for a few seconds before Taion felt too awkward. He quickly turned the other way and tucked in a quick reply, "In fact, just forget it."</p>
<p>She was disappointed, urging for more, "Aw come on...! You've already told us that much. Might as well give us the whole story!"</p>
<p>He awkwardly pushed his glasses up, "Thi-this is just not the place or time for it, that's all."</p>
<p>She sleepy-eyed him, "Laaaame..." Then, changing to a happy tone, "Still, it was a nice chat." Taion turned to face her as he sensed a change in atmosphere, and she continued, "Dreams in objects, huh... Hmhmhm..." Her ears wiggled as she laughed.</p>
<p>"Ug-Ugh..." He just looked at her, speechless. Noah was also looking at her.</p>
<p>Mio appreciated, "Thanks, Taion! We came here to cheer you up a bit, and got food for thought instead."</p>
<p>He was taken by surprise, unsure how to replied to her compliments: "Oh, sure. Any time."</p>
<p>As Mio continued to speak with him, Noah looked at her, particularly her term symbol, and spoke lightly in his heart (or brain), "<em>(Mio...)</em>"</p>

<p>As the group continued their journey, they arrived by a cliff. Looking into the distance, Sena wanted to confirm, "Is that...?"</p>
<p>A castle with broad base and a single tall pillar pierced up into the sky, black fog swirled around its top. There were other mushroom-like features beside it, tall, thin stem, and a cap. It looked blurry in the distance. Between them and the castle, we could see no lands, only cloud sea and air. To their 10 o'clock, another ledge slightly lower than where they stood, its top carpeted with trees; clearly, a forest. Behind them, a lake. On an island to around 8 o'clock, we could see a Ferronis Hulk working in the background{{footnote: One only saw this in the first video. Can't remember, and lazy to verify, whether it can be seen in the second video or not.}}. Higher unreachable ledge with trees grown on top defined the lake boundaries.</p>
<p>Eunie affirmed, "That's Keves Castle, all right. First time seeing it?"</p>
<p>She nodded, "Yeah..."</p>
<p>Manana commented, "Same level of elaborate as Castle of Agnus!"</p>
<p>Riku turned to face where the forest are were. On a higher platform to their left, nearer to them than the forest, we could see abandoned high tech buildings infested by trees. In the background, "Can also see Great Sword on left."</p>
<p>Taion asked Noah, "Are we going through with this?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "No, I see it's far too risky now. The area will be under strict guard. But downslope, we could go via the forest." To their left, there was a seemingly muddy path.</p>
<p>"Maktha Wildwood, huh..."</p>
<p>Mio agreed with him, "Doesn't sound too bad to me." Taion took the lead, the others followed behind. Noah stood behind to look at the castle for a longer moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Inside Keves Castle.)</p>
<p>Two soldiers were leading Ethel through a walkway, with Borealis following behind her, exclaiming as he examined the castle walls, "Oh-ho! Weh-hell, never been this far in before." The walls, floors, seemed metallic; tall ceilings stretched the pentagonal tunnel. A barred window appeared at the ceiling, looking towards the sky. Beams/pillars shaped like insect legs, with a few segments, twitched in an angle appeared to the left and right at every fixed distance.</p>
<p>"Me neither... The last time I had an audience with the Queen, she had come in person to the warfront."They reached the end of the tunnel. A fan-shaped staircase opened up before them, a part of the circular higher platform. Two pillars at the edge of the staircase displayed a 3D cyan hologram, two rings with triangle 'teeth', one smaller than the other, around a stick-like structure. At the top of the platform was an elevator; Ethel and the others entered it and traversed upwards.</p>
<p>Exiting the elevator, the exit directly facing the Queen's chamber. The hologram lined beside the pathway, few steps higher than the elevator. Behind them, squid-like metal bars provide a scene for the larger rooms behind the castle. Ornate embroidered crystals that emanates light hung from the top, a part of a circle. Higher to the top, one wasn't sure if that were lights, or windows looking at the bright outdoor.</p>
<p>As they approached the Queen's seat, pods were lining the side where she stood, still not yet sheathed. The soldiers walked to the side and joined other soldiers in line while Ethel and Borealis approached the Queen. Where she stood, both did the Kevesi welcoming stance before reporting in, "Commander Ethel, Fornis Forward Army's Colony 4, reporting in as ordered, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"It has been some time, hasn't it?"</p>
<p>"Ma'am... I am elated to find you in good stead, Your Majesty. That you would grace us with your presence, is an honor, above my station. "</p>
<p>"We can dispense with the stiff preambles, Ethel." Looking to her right, "N..."</p>
<p>N, stood beside her even before Ethel entered, nodded his head, "Ma'am..." Holding out his hands, a circular control panel hologram with several rings came online.</p>
<p>"N...?" Ethel was curious about him. "Consul N...? That's him?"</p>
<p>"N..." Borealis spoke what he had heard of him, "The head honcho of Kevesi Consuls himself. The Golden Consul..." As if he didn't liked his eyes, he looked sideways towards him. Borealis quickly dropped his head and avoid glancing.</p>
<p>A cannon attached to the ring, the ring along the fattest part of the Keves Castle. The cannon began to slide along the ring. Reaching its position, a hologram projected behind Ethel and Borealis; they turned their head to see the cannon displayed live. "What is that...?"</p>
<p>N took the pleasure to explain, "The <strong>Annihilator</strong>... The latest weapon in our military arsenal. It utilizes breakthroughs in application of the annihilation effect."</p>
<p>"You've harnessed it?!"</p>
<p>As they were speaking, the black fog that swirled around the tallest part of the castle gets absorbed by the Flame Clock between the pitch fork.{{footnote: Similar to the one behind the queen, this Flame Clock <em>also</em> displayed half-Kevesi half-Agnian flames.}} The absorbed black fog were perhaps compressed into unknown states (Liquid? Plasma?) and transferred along the ring to the annihilator.</p>
<p>While absorbing, the cannon opened up its 'flaps' like flower petals, revealing a center needle filled with unknown states black fog.</p>
<p>N continued, "Not only is its power without equal, it has another exquisite benefit. Let me show you."</p>
<p>Ethel was shocked, turned and asked him, "What, you mean... right here and now?"</p>
<p>Contracting his eyelids behind his mask, "Indeed. This will be its finest hour." As the central filament rotates furiously, purple electricity zapped around the 'petals', a ball of energy gathered in front of the needle's tip.</p>
<p>The screen changed to show his destination, "The Urayan Mountains... A terrible shame. Her Majesty has a soft spot for them. Please do not think ill of me."</p>
<p>Reaching its threshold, it fired straight at the mountains; the light released so bright it penetrated to where Ethel was. She gasped as she closed her eyes and turned her head to the other side. On the Urayan Mountain, we saw the surface quickly gained heat, then a rainbow colored ball of annihilation even occurred, carving a crevasse in the mountains. Like usual annihilation event, it quickly dissipated, and leave rock remnants swirling around its 'center of gravity'. The dust it sent with the shockwave so thick it reached where the castle was.</p>
<hr />
<p>On flat soily, muddy ground, the group were walking when a loud boom reverberated around their ears, shook the ground, and glows so bright that night time turns to day time{{footnote: Can only be seen if you had the nighttime scene, which is in the first video only.}}. Sena was shouting out of fear while Mio was flabbergasted, "Wha-What?! What was that?"</p>
<p>Eunie suggested, "Just thunder...innit?" Not seeing any attacks, they got out of their defensive posture.</p>
<p>Lanz seriously commented: "Brighter than any lightning I've ever seen. "</p>
<p>Riku mither, "Still ringing in ears..."</p>
<p>Taion questioned, "Where did the light come from?" He and Noah were looking to the top, Noah answering,</p>
<p>"No idea. But... this can't be good..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in the castle. The screen displayed the carved out mountains. Ethel exclaimed, "What incredible power..." Borealis still flabbergasted.</p>
<p>N: "Its effective range... has no discernible limit whatsoever."</p>
<p>Ethel felt something bad, "Wha-What are you?" They turned to face him.</p>
<p>"I'm saying an attack like the one you just witnessed can be delivered... <strong>anywhere</strong>."</p>
<p>"So you mean to use this weapon against Agnus? Ah... If you're to use this, then... what about the Clocks...?"</p>
<p>The Queen snapped, "Who said anything about using it on Agnus?"</p>
<p>Her iris widened, "Ma'am...?"</p>
<p>"The next target... will be this." The screen changed to display Colony 4, as Ethel and Borealis watched, mouth wide opened in shock.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were walking on some muddy lands. We could hear gushing water to their right. Lanz gingerly tread as he was about to walk downslope, warned the group, "Watch the moss, guys, Mind you don't slip-woooooaaaaayyyyyyeeeaaahhhh...." And he slipped, crashing into some muddy ground.</p>
<p>Eunie just gloated at him, "Ahahahahaha! He says, falling flat on his arse himself."</p>
<p>Lanz, slowly climbing on his feet, snapped back at her, "Oh yeah, bloody hilarious. You're always taking the mick out of me. Noah!" He and Eunie turned to him, but he was slow to reply, lost in his thoughts,</p>
<p>"Huh? Did you say something?"</p>
<p>"Oh for... Don't come crying if you fall." Then, he turned his back on him, walking off, perhaps feeling disappointed.</p>
<p>The group continued their path while Mio stopped beside him, remarked, "You seem like you're a million miles away...{{footnote: Ok, so they calculated distance <em>also</em> by miles?}} Lot on your mind?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, kinda..." He nodded to her before got lost in his thoughts again. Mio felt the heavy burden as she watched him for a few seconds. Seeing he didn't wanted to say anything, she continued her path. Noah saw her move and followed behind.</p>
<p>"Aaahhh..." Just before she got down the slope, her body feels weak and she slowly fall forward.</p>
<p>"Ah-ah? Mio!" That snapped Noah's attention back to reality. He quickly ran in front of her and supported her by her shoulders. She squeezed her arms a bit to feel herself, before putting an arm on his to support her standing up.</p>
<p>"Ah... Thank you." Seeing that she regained strength, he released his support from her.</p>
<p>Looking straight at her eyes, he asked, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>She tried brighten up the situation, smilingly explained herself, "Yeah, I just lost my foo-footing for a second. I'm-I'm OK." Then she looked away, in a softer and dispirited tone, "For now, I'm OK..."</p>
<p>Noah heard her, "For now...?" He turned to her term symbol, then nervously asked, "Ar-Are you... not... feeling a hundred percent?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Uh?</strong> Nah, nothing like that!" She raised her tone in denial, smiling back at him, "I'm totally fine, promise. Like I said, I just <em>missed</em> my footing."</p>
<p>He was concerned about her, looked at her for more minor body languages. Perhaps she didn't wanted to say more, he could only stodgily urged, "If you start feeling worse, just say. I <em>don't want you hiding it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mhm." She nodded, remarked, "You're a kind man, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"I-I'm just... being polite." He blushed at her compliment, stiffly turned away from her, eyes looking into nowhere and continued walking to ease the nervousness. Alas! Lanz's wishes came true! He slid down the slope, "Whooooooaaaaaa!!!" Mio was shocked to see him slide. The group in front, hearing his voice, quickly turned to the side; except Lanz whom was directly in his path, stuck with choosing left or right to evade, bluntly stuck in position as he crashed into him.</p>
<p>Mio, after seeing they suffer no injuries, smiled. Perhaps, he had made her day.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were gathering by a bonfire. Eunie sat behind a desk, Taion's teapot on it, and Taion speaking to her. To her left, Manana and Riku far asleep. To their left, we could se some old buildings overgrown with plants. Below their legs, Lanz and Sena were doing push ups, facing each other. To Sena's left, Noah sat and looked at the bonfire, lost in his thoughts. To his left, Mio was squatting in front of some undefined possessions, unsure what she was doing. As she finished, she stood up and sat beside the stood to Noah's left, asking, "So what was on your mind? Earlier." To their left, a pond behind a human-tall rock, and a small waterfall in the distance filling up the pond.</p>
<p>"Yeah, that light...? I was wondering if it had anything to do with us..."</p>
<p>"You think, maybe... Could it've been something that Moebius did?" To which he nodded.</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?" That attracted the group's attention. She and Lanz just finished their push ups. Taion and Eunie also turned to him.</p>
<p>"...We know that they're hunting us."</p>
<p>"Mm..." Mio agreed.</p>
<p>Turning to Taion, he asked for confirmation, "Taion, you told us before... That our Consuls were actually the same."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I did say that."</p>
<p>"After that, nobody said so, but... we were all <em>thinking</em> it. The war between Agnus and Keves, and the Consuls... or rather, Moebius. They must be connected somehow." There was a moment of silence as they digested his shares, before Mio shared her thoughts,</p>
<p>"It could be that... all the fighting. It might be that it's all orchestrated according to Moebius. "</p>
<p>"And to them, Ouroboros... only spell trouble."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Since we keep wrecking their Flame Clocks and all."</p>
<p>Sena: "They must really hate us messing with their stuff, I guess..." Behind Sena, we could see that a wide staircase located beside the overgrown building.</p>
<p>Lanz, arms around his chest, "So we're one big thorn in their side."</p>
<p>In his thinking stance, Taion: "Hmm... It does stand to reason that's why we're their targets, but it doesn't tell us anything about why our colonies fight. Any theories?"</p>
<p>He bent forward as he grabbed both arms together, fingers between each other, two thumbs crossed into an 'X', as he replied, "Not as yet. But I figure... Isn't discovering <em>that</em> our real objective here, right? If we seek out the City... Maybe we'll find answers."</p>
<p>Mio: "One way to know." The group enjoyed a moment of silence as he sat straight and turned to look at her.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Tall modern looking buildings, glass shattered, some toppled, clearly unmaintained for eons. Balcony stretches to the side of the building, infested by ferns, giant flowers, trees, and goats! Some trunks are so huge it engulfed parts of the building within it.  Tiles covered some part of the floor where animals like cobra, rattlesnake, and more goats roamed. Cavities due to collapsed floor were filled with waters, turning it into a shallow pond.

</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The entrance to the forest overlooked the various tightly packed modern buildings, dilapidated yet seems unnatural as nature usually overgrows all parts of the building in a decade or so -- just look at the moss if you hadn't cleaned a part of your building! Though tree spring tall, taller than the tall platform where they stood, and clouds about the same height, the overlooked the distance and enjoyed the scenery for a moment.</p>
<p>Eunie broke the silence as she folded her arms and expressed repugnance, "Man, those Moebius mooks... They make my feathers stand on end. Ending peoples' lives like it doesn't matter. Urgh. What a sick joke."</p>
<p>Riku: "There word for people like that. Know what Nopon say?"</p>
<p>Sena tilted her head, "No idea. Tell us?"</p>
<p>He looked at the sky, held his wings out, as if whatever he said next is worth the rituals, "'<strong>Supervillainpon</strong>'."</p>
<p>Noah asked for explanation to the group, "Riku, what does that mean, then?"</p>
<p>"It mean extreme bad guy."</p>
<p>"Ahh, I think I get it." Say it like never said.</p>
<p>"Meh-meh...?" Even Manana was confused; or perhaps, she had a questions for them?</p>
<p>"Wassup, Manana?" Eunie prompted.</p>
<p>She turned to face them, questioned, "Then, are Noah and Mio and friends... supervillainpon?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "You're labeling us?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Labeling</strong>. Because friends used to end lives also!"</p>
<p>"Urgh!" Eunie gasped in realization, never seen from that point of view.</p>
<p>"That not make them supervillainpon?"</p>
<p>Eunie tried to explain herself, "I mean... It's not like we ever had a choice or anything. It was them or us."</p>
<p>"So when no choice, not fall under definition then?"</p>
<p>Lanz added in a low tone, "None of us ever fought 'cause we wanted to. It's just how it worked. How people worked, and the world."</p>
<p>"So... World is supervillainpon!"</p>
<p>"Whuh?!" Manana changed idea so quickly he couldn't synchronize with her.</p>
<p>"Since it make everyone do nasty things! <strong>World is bad guy</strong>!" The is a paradigm shift, from thinking of bad individuals, to a bad world.</p>
<p>Noah considered the statement, "The world is... <em>bad</em>? Huh! I never thought of it like that!"</p>
<p>Lanz, in a sorrowful tone, "Now that you mention it, what in the world, are we even here for?" That makes the rest of the group galled, deep in sorrow, as they thought of the life questions posed to them, what it meant to them, and how they relate to it.</p>
<p>Taion, in his thinking mode, cut the resentment short, "I wouldn't strain your brain too much."</p>
<p>Lanz snapped back unconsciously, "Sounds like <em>you</em> have."</p>
<p>"What gave you that idea?"</p>
<p>"Cut the snark, just tell me!"</p>
<p>"The end-point of it is... suicide."</p>
<p>"Say what?" Lanz quietly asked him to explain.</p>
<p>"If you don't want to hurt others, you'll end up denying your own right to survive. Eventually, you come to the conclusion that, the world may well be better off without your presence. The only resolution then, is to erase the self. To die." Then, looking at Lanz, "See? Pointless."</p>
<p>"Isn't that taking it too far?"</p>
<p>"The world doesn't just vanish because you've closed your eyes." Noah sounded from beside, seemingly disagreed with his statement. He was still looking down, considering, as the group turned to him,</p>
<p>Taion prompted deeper, "What...?"</p>
<p>"The moon..." The group turned to face the sky. High above the the building on a clear evening sky, a full moon illuminates.{{footnote: Hey, the moon wasn't there before!}} "Think about it. Why is it that the moon shines? Just because we're watching?{{footnote: Well, think about it. If Earth were to split into half, did the moon also split into half? If the two halves of the Earth, eons later, were to come together and formed Aionios, were the two halves of the moon come together 'perfectly' joined, and formed a circular moon? When they split, do each half of Earth gets each half of the Moon? Do they crush under gravity and changed back to a spherical shape? Now think about it...}} {{footnote: Could be seen in first video clearly, but second video, due to clouds, not really, until the clouds blew away.}} Of course not. Even if humans were gone, it would shine on, illuminating the land beneath. And yet... <strong>We're the ones, that give meaning to it</strong>. We say '<em>bit dim tonight</em>,' or.. '<em>Looks brighter than usual, eh?</em>' Similarly, we can now imbue the world with meaning, or change it. It's a privilege we were lucky to obtain."</p>
<p>Mio wished to ascertain some answers from him, turning to look in his eyes,  "And that's... the power of Ouroboros?" The others followed their glance. He returned glance and nodded.</p>
<p>"We're obliged to use it. We can make a difference."</p>
<p>"So we don't become supervillains?"</p>
<p>"That's one thing to aim for, at least. Right?" He turned to face Manana and the group, Mio followed his glance. Manana was fluttering her wings, the others kept silence.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group descended some staircase, Lanz foreboded, stopping on his path, questioning, "Hey... You sure we're going the right way, guys?" The group stopped and turned to face him.</p>
<p>Sena assessed the direction they're walking. Tiles and buildings with occasional plants sticking out, can't see a path at the end.{{footnote: Actually, you have to slide on the rope, seeing from retrospect.}}, commented, "Mmm... Well, it's a path, at least..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Looks like it's going to be real pain getting through here."</p>
<p>Taion agreed, "True. But we don't have the luxury of loitering."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well, I don't see any other road to take. So, let's just get this over with." She took the lead, the others watched her walked a few steps before catching up behind.</p>
<p>As they continued, someone slid from a tight rope, both ends attached to higher ups of the building where they were walking, jumped, and shot three green arrows at the group. Mio's ears wiggled as she heard the screeching of air particles dragging past the arrowheads, shouted,  "...?! Eunie, look out!" She made a dash towards her, hugged, her, and they went on the ground together. Eunie still hadn't figured the situation, but as her head faced up, she saw the arrows landed where she originally stood. The arrow exploded after the rolled on the floor and stopped.</p>
<p>The explosion shocked her more, "Waaugh?!" and she waddle like a frog backwards, away from the center of explosion. She tilt her head up, and saw a female, green hair, turquoise iris, pointing her bow at her. She was standing above a beam of the building. Eunie quickly got on her feet, concurrently withdrewing her blades, and took a shot at her. She jumped to evade the attacks, landed in front of the group. More Agnian soldiers slide from the rope and landed beside and behind her.</p>
<p>Lanz, flabbergasted, was slow to react, loudly questioning, "Wha-What the?! An ambush?!"</p>
<p>Seeing the girl raised her bow pointing at them, Noah instantaneously reacted as he shouted to the group, "Ah?! Weapons, quick!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the fight.)</p>
<p><strong>Juniper</strong> sighed as she saw the group sheathed their blades.</p>
<p>Noah shouted to the group, "We just want to pass through! We're not looking for trouble!"</p>
<p>Sena added, "C'mon guys, what's your problem?"</p>
<p>One of her teammates, male, brown skin, buff, shouted, "Juniper! Imogen's at her limit! She can't keep going!" His name's Carson.</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Another neck-long hair, pale skin, yellow iris, pointed chin, disappointingly gruntled, "Spark... And we could've had their life, too... <em>So close</em>!"</p>
<p>Noah shockingly gasped, "...Ah!"</p>
<p>Juniper, sheathing her blades, called out, "That's very unfortunate. We'll have to retreat, then." Then, they turned and ran off in the distance.</p>
<p>Lanz was still confused since the start, "What was all that about? Weirdos."</p>
<p>Seeing that Noah was thinking about the situation, Taion asked for more information, "Noah? What's wrong?"</p>
<p>He turned to face him, shook his head, "I was just thinking..."</p>
<p>Getting to his thinking stance, he answered for him, "About the archer? They seemed quite the formidable opponent, to be sure..."</p>
<p>Folding his arms, "That's true, but there was something else about them..." They still seemed to be high enough to have clouds around them, but certainly lower than the viewpoint from before. {{footnote: Before, they were too high to see clouds below them, just like you usually see clouds below you when you boarded an airplane; and those clouds that were taller than where your plane flies were relatively rarer than the cloud sea below, provided you were flying past cloudy zones.}}</p>
<p>Mio connected the dots, prompted for more, "Say, you don't think...?"</p>
<p>"Those soldiers' Flame Clocks, they might be getting low..."</p>
<p>Taion wasn't enthused, folding his arms, "Oh, come on, Noah. You'd better not be thinking of offering your assistance..."</p>
<p>"It's... hard to put into words, but... something's off."</p>
<p>He aggressively rebutted, "And you think we have time to be traipsing around on this whim of yours?"</p>
<p>Sena lightly added, "It really bothers you?"</p>
<p>He nodded, "Yeah."</p>
<p>Eunie knows more how he acts, teased, "Give it up, Taion. Once Noah's like this, there's no stopping him." That's him in the battlefield causing the group always missing the transporting levnises, eh!</p>
<p>"Whuh why do I bother?"</p>
<p>Lanz added, "Besides, Noah's intuition's usually pretty on the mark."</p>
<p>Sena suggested softly, "We could just take a look... A-a tiny little peek?"</p>
<p>"Pfft... Fine. I can see no amount of reasoning is going to dissuade you. However, if it turns out to be nothing, we head straight back and move on. Acceptable?"</p>
<p>He agreed and shouted to the group, "That's fine. OK, let's move. We should be able to catch up to them if we follow their tracks."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group was looking at a rope-slicing device that can take them to the other parts of the platform. Along their 3 o'clock, there was a long path that leads to the distance, down the slope. Trees grew on the platform on the other side, even if it seems very tall from the ground floor of the building.</p>
<p>Taion: "Judging by how the tracks stop here, it seems that this is where those soldiers passed through."</p>
<p>"Through here? But... how?" Sena didn't consider the possibility of sliding down ropes, despite seeing the Agnians did it earlier.</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Hmm. Doesn't look easily traversable, does it?"</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Yeah, I can't see us getting across there any time soon..."</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "We could always took a detour. Look, this way." Unsure where he's pointing to, perhaps the path on the right?</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah. Thanks, Taion."</p>
<p>"Like I said, we can't afford to be hanging around here. Come on, we haven't got all day."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group finally arrived at the platform overlooking the Ferronis if they'd climb the staircase that led up to where it's parked. Walls around the colony means they only had to defend the front door if anything happened, unless they could "air drop" soldiers into the colony, be it by flying machines, or jumping from above just like they did when they slid on the ropes.</p>
<p>Sena was awed, "...This is crazy. There-there was a colony, here?!"</p>
<p>As she finished, Juniper walked down the staircase, or perhaps the slope, calmly and docile, replying to her, "That's right. This is an abandoned colony."</p>
<p>Noah shouted back, still trying to persuade that he came for peace, "Please listen to us! We didn't come here to fight you!"</p>
<p>"Mmm..."</p>
<p>"We can free you from your Flame Clock."</p>
<p>"...Free us?" That caught her attention.</p>
<p>Folding his arms, "You don't have much time left on yours, do you? We can help you with that, so if you'd just-"</p>
<p>She finished his sentence, "Stop attacking you?"</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>"Mmm..." She thought of the situation for a second, before nodding in agreement, considering their situation couldn't be much worse than they're now, "All right. I'll hear you out."</p>
<p>"...Ah... thank you!" Noah was shocked the persuasion was effortless, could only appreciated and muster some thanks.</p>
<p>"Please, come in."</p>
<p>As Juniper turned and lead the group, Taion quietly whispered and warned, "They're still wary of us. We can't let our guard down."</p>
<hr />
<p>They were standing in front of the Ferronis, and Taion was surprised as he exclaimed, "I've seen a few colonies with dwindling Flame Clocks before, but this one is especially bizarre..."</p>
<p>Noah added, "It's like they're not trying to survive here at all... Do you get that impression?"</p>
<p>Inside the walls lies the colony. Some of the walls were totally overgrown. They built their tents, or perhaps, huts, sparsely around both side of the main road. There were some boxes, tables, perhaps a bath (a dark olive green{{footnote: Color code: #588352 }} building). A taller hut the shape of a crown was perhaps the commander's chamber. The Ferronis was positioned above a stage, and below the stage were all the buildings as stated. Just in front of the stage was a tent with one or two tables, and something that resembles a fabricator.</p>
<p>Taion continued, "Back when I was stationed at Lambda, I'd heard rumors about Colony Tau."</p>
<p>Mio was curious, "What did they say?"</p>
<p>"That deep in the forest, there's a colony with some very peculiar customs and traditions. This is my first time seeing it in reality, but I never expected it to be so run-down..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Did you have any dealings with it?"</p>
<p>"None at all. This is just hearsay from Commander Isurd."</p>
<p>Noah: "Anyway, we should hurry. Let's smash the Flame Clock and free everyone."</p>
<p>Juniper, accompanied by a companion with crystals grown around the earlobes, darker skin, and lines representing those of Isurd from his temple down, and seen also on the back of his palm, approached the group as they turned to face each other.</p>
<p>Juniper started with their current situation, "It being an abandoned colony, we are continually starved of sufficient life sources."</p>
<p>Noah: "Wait... Are you the commander?"</p>
<p>"That's right. Sorry I failed to tell you before. I am Juniper, and it's my job to lead Colony Tau."</p>
<p>"If that's so, then surely you must know who we are."</p>
<p>She shook her head, "I'm afraid I know nothing."</p>
<p>Noah was surprised, or perhaps it explained why they attacked them in search of life forces. "...Huh."</p>
<p>She affirmed. "We have no need of such information."</p>
<p>The guy behind, Raine, added, "Juniper told us we'd welcome you in, whoever you might turn out to be. So, that's the rule! We don't ask questions."</p>
<p>Eunie snapped back, "But you attacked us back there!"</p>
<p>He tried to reason, "Our scouts told us about some monsters in the forest they'd never seen before, so, we sent them out on a hunt. But then they bumped into you en route. They must've figured it'd be more efficient to get you out of the way first."</p>
<p>Juniper nodded and accepted failures, "Though, contrary to our plan, we were made to retreat."</p>
<p>Lanz was curious, "Oh yeah, what about your Consul? Where are they hiding?"</p>
<p>"I told you, this is an abandoned colony. Our Consul rarely visits us."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're in such a strange situation..."</p>
<p>Noah was determined, "All the more reason to get you out of this predicament!"</p>
<p>Raine see that they had different paradigms, stood on different grounds, "I think you guys are getting the wrong end of the stick here." While the group sees they were worth the pity, the people whom got pitied were happily living their lives, unaffected by comparison with the outer world.</p>
<p>Juniper breathe out forcefully, "It's true. We aren't afraid of Colony Tau's Flame Clock running out. All it means is the end of our days gazing at our ever-diminishing supply."</p>
<p>Noah debated: "But you could die!"</p>
<p>Raine agreed with his statement, added, "Uh-huh. As if we'd just let you waltz in and break our Flame Clock."</p>
<p>Juniper added, closing her eyes as she imagined the situation into the future, "We all have to perish someday. If our lives should expire, then we'll sink into silence, darkness... oblivion." With her eyes open, she continued, "We'll return to the earth..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio shook her head in disagreement.</p>
<p>Noah still tried to convince them from taking their lives too easily, too frivolously, "Yes, but...! Y-you can't just...!"</p>
<p>Juniper cut him short, "The land will take us, and we will simply 'be'. That's how it is at Colony Tau. No one will ever think of us, and yet here we are. Slowly, but surely, we are withering. We don't always find the nutrition that we need to live. If Colony Tau cannot accumulate the vital flames it needs, then it proves only that we were too weak. And in nature, the weak are destined to perish."</p>
<p>Taion, folding his arms, rebutted, "Though logic would dictate that nature is pushing you to become stronger."</p>
<p>Lanz added, "If we set you free, you won't have to worry about all this crap."</p>
<p>Juniper: "We neither worry nor fear for what may come to pass." They still couldn't synchronize with each other on how they looked at death.</p>
<p>Raine added, "We've already lost so many of our friends and allies. " To 8 o'clock of Raine was their canteen, blanketed by the stars and clouds, lined with tables arranged in two rows. There were some 'drums'-like object arranged, unsure for what{{footnote: In retrospect, they're for Nopon dancing on it. For some reason...}}. The cafeteria that served the rations was behind the tables, under a tent.</p>
<p>Juniper: "And every time, we returned their bodies to the earth. Such will be our fate."</p>
<p>Raine: "What's the point of fearing the inevitable? We know we're gonna die. What's wrong with us living the way we always have?"</p>
<p>Noah couldn't understand, "But how do you live without hope?"</p>
<p>Juniper calmly answered, "It will spell the end of the story that our predecessors weaved for generations... A tale cut short. I won't argue, that it feels a little <em>melancholy</em>... In that sense, if we were to be freed from the Flame Clock, then..."</p>
<p>As she was speaking, an Agnian soldier ran up and approached them. The guy, Selin, shouted while they turned to face him,  "<strong>JUNIPER! BAD NEWS!</strong>"</p>
<p>"...Tell me."</p>
<p>"The monsters're coming straight for the colony! And they already took one of us down!"</p>
<p>"No... They came all the way here?!" Abandoning Noah's group, they ran off into the distance, with Selin leading the way to their entrance.</p>
<p>From behind, Noah shouted, "We'll join you!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(Just outside the colony, below the slope where the group stood overlooking the colony)</p>
<p>Juniper, Raine, and Seine arrived in front, shielding two other guys behind them, another guy between the two seriously injured, laying on the floor. There were grass and some short coconut-like trees that pierced their roots and stems through the tiles into the mud/soil below. There were three rhinos-like blue monsters, with armor plates attached behind their backs, and some protruding from their heads that shaped like a dimetrodon's fin.</p>
<p>Juniper: "Ngh...!"</p>
<p>Raine shouted in emergency, "Juniper, we need orders!"</p>
<p>Juniper quickly sniped his words, "... This is perfectly fine. We'll defeat them, right here."</p>
<p>Noah and his groups ran and joined them from behind, Noah calling out, "Juniper!"</p>
<p>"What are you...?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ask us later."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "We'll back you up!"</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll fight to the best of my abilities as well."</p>
<p>Noah shouted to the group, "Here we go!" Then, all withdrew their blades.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the battle.)</p>
<p>Raine was inspecting the seriously injured guy, relieved, exclaimed, "Geum's OK! He's still alive! Thank the flames..."</p>
<p>Juniper appreciated, "I'm so glad we made it in time... I'm so glad..." Then, turning to the group with her team, she directed to the group, "Again, accept my thanks. We couldn't have done this without you."</p>
<p>Noah, shaking his head, "Don't worry about it."</p>
<p>"Hah" Juniper breathed out seeing herself contradicting herself, "I suppose it's strange of me to talk about the laws of nature when I fear losing my friends."</p>
<p>"Not at all. Honestly, that seems like the most natural thing of all."</p>
<p>"When you told me that you would release us from the Flame Clock... I thought that... if you really were telling the truth, it would make life easier. But... at the same time, I began to hate the fact that I was looking for a way out. Looking up at our Clock, seeing the life ebbing away... I'd already accepted my fate. And letting go of that status quo, wretched though it was... After so long, I was scared of what might happen if we did."</p>
<p>Raine could synchronize with the stone pressing on her heart, "Juniper..."</p>
<p>Juniper had a combination of exciting voice plus on-the-verge-of-tears tone, a combination of happiness and sadness, mixing seamlessly, "Noah, your words at the time seemed so appealing to me. I could not destroy the collective efforts that became the colony, and everything it represents, with my own two hands. But then <em>you</em> said you would destroy it for us. <strong>We'd be guilt-free</strong>! If that isn't appealing... then what is?"</p>
<p>"You must've been aware of how tragic it is to simply await death. That's why you invited us, isn't it?"</p>
<p>Juniper shook her head, "Even now, I'm not afraid of dying." Pausing and turning slightly to the left, gestured to the guys beside and behind her, "But I hated the idea of losing those I hold dear... When I saw my friend lying there... I remembered what you told me, and, for a brief moment, <em>felt the grip of fear</em>." Then, closing her eyes to be immersed in her feelings, "I felt so weak, and helpless... yet at the same time, I didn't want to let go of my dear friend. So I must have closed myself off. I stopped thinking. Closed my eyes and covered my ears..." Opening her eyes back, "Perhaps I was simply... waiting for the inevitable release."</p>
<p>"Even so, we have to keep thinking."</p>
<p>Mio seconded him, "That's right -- <em><strong>even if there are things we'd rather not see, we still need to look</strong></em>.{{footnote: Better face forward than stay in the location, because the latter would cause you to regret, the former, even if it failed, you won't regret for not even dare to try, at the very least.}}"</p>
<p>Noah continued, "And breaking out of your shell, scrambling in desperation for a way to escape despair? That's not what I call being weak. You've defended this place for so long. Why? Because you're strong. And once you're no longer shackled by the rules of the Flame Clock, you can accept a different reality... You can become stronger still. I know it."</p>
<p>Juniper: "We can?"</p>
<p>He nodded in affirmation, "You can."</p>
<p>Mio added, "It won't be easy -- far from it. But we'll help you."</p>
<p>Raine called out from behind, and she turned to face him, "Juniper... It's your call."</p>
<p>Selin nodded in agreement, "We've made it this far thanks to you."</p>
<p>Juniper nodded, "Yes... I suppose so..." Signaling to the group, "<em>If</em>... there is a possibility that you can release us from the Clock, then... please."</p>
<p>Raine, in a joking tone, shrugged off to not let hope stayed too high, in case they felt disappointment after, "And if not, it's not like anything's changed."</p>
<p>That raised Juniper's mood, and she laughed in return, "Haha! Very true. If you can't break it, I can live with that too." Then, looking down, perhaps the idea seemed disappointing after giving them so much hope, "Nothing changes without a reason, without a cause." Looking back at the group, "Perhaps this event will teach me to see things in a new light..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and Mio facing the Colony Tau's Flame Clock, Noah shouted "Here we go!" as blue lights emblazoned their body, The Ouroboros symbol enlivened their iris. They jumped and canceled their Interlink thereafter, Noah sliced the Flame Clock from down to up himself, Mio falling back down behind him. 'Lives' escaped it for a moment before dissipating, the 'left' part of the Flame Clock crashed onto the ground below as it dislocated itself.</p>
<hr />
<p>Juniper looked at the destroyed Flame Clock, shook her head, in a grateful tone, "I see acceptance is actually surprisingly easy, when it comes down to it."</p>
<p>Sena agreed with her, "I think it probably is, yeah."</p>
<p>Then, Juniper turned to the group, "Uhh... I'm sorry if this seems rude, but, could I ask another favor of you?"</p>
<p>Noah nodded in return, "Sure!"</p>
<p>"I'd like to learn much more of the world. Become a stronger individual. To that end, is there any chance I could accompany you?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Whatdaya say, guys?"</p>
<p>Taion logically analyzed, "We could certainly do with someone of Juniper's caliber..."</p>
<p>Noah: "It'd be reassuring to have you on board. You're very welcome to join."</p>
<p>Eunie asked, "Is your colony gonna be OK, though? Can they get on without you?"</p>
<p>"Colony Tau needs to undergo change too. We need to extend our knowledge and grow." Then, she turned to his fellow Agnian colleagues and friends, while signaling back at Noah's group, "So I'd like you to take me on a trip. Somewhere far away... And show me something new."</p>
<p>Selin answered in excitement, "A... journey of discovery, huh? I guess that's another thing we need in order to grow."</p>
<p>Raine agreed too, suggested with an upbeat tone, hands on his waist, "Might be an idea to send some of our younger recruits out too. Could be a good lesson."</p>
<p>Juniper: "It's time to breathe new life into our colony. Let us break free from the chains that once bound us."</p>
<p>Raine shook his head, in a joking tone, "I guess I'm still hanging about, though. Can't have us all gallivanting about the place."</p>
<p>Lanz was still bothered with: "Your Consul really doesn't bother to show up, huh..."</p>
<p>Mio nodded in agreement, "Even after we broke the Flame Clock... You'd think they'd know."</p>
<p>Eunie enjoyed being trouble-free: "Better this way, if you ask me."</p>
<p>Taion shook his head from the optimism, "Still, we shouldn't rule out the possibility that they'll make trouble for you."</p>
<p>Noah, looking to Raine and the other Agnians, "If something happens, you tell us immediately, OK?"</p>
<p>The group look back, wavered, "Sure! Can do! We'll be counting on you."</p>
<p>Taion signaled the group for departure, hands crossed, "Well, we don't have all day. I think it's about time we made tracks, no?"</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "You're right. Time to move, then."</p>
<p>Juniper: "Well then, everyone..."</p>
<p>Before she could say anything, Raine jokingly assured her, "Ahhh, don't worry about us. You know we can handle ourselves."</p>
<p>Selin added from behind him, "We'll prove that Colony Tau... can be so. much. more!"</p>
<p>Juniper nodded, "Yes... I'm sure it will be."</p>
<p>Raine nudged, "Off you go then, skedaddle! The colony's staying right here, waiting for your return..."</p>

<p>The group exited the colony, walking towards a giant tree (presumably they need to pass it). Unbeknownst to them, a robot was concealing in front of them, whom removed its invisibility status as they approached. It looked like a levnis, but a very small one, humanoid shape of human height, and seemingly a manned levnis than an unmanned one like the little friend Valdi built from before, and with the head of a horn and single eyed, some thorns that pinged out from its elbows, a really fat and protruded chest, and long legs.</p>
<p>The group immediately get into defensive posture, Lanz shouted out his mind, "Wh-what the snuff?! Where'd this come from?!" Behind him, we could see unshattered glass windows arranged layers by layers, with a tree trunk that seemingly grew in the balcony (a.k.a. ground, we assume they're walking on a balcony right now).</p>
<p>As the robot withdrew its weapon, a dual-hand axe, Noah did too while warning the group, "...Careful! Here it comes!"</p>
<hr />
<p>(After the fight)</p>
<p>Seeing that it had no chance of winning, it sheathed its blade and immediately concealed itself, disappeared from the scene. The group sheathed their blade, seeing the danger's gone, while Sena was still puzzled over the situation, spoke the group's question, "It... It disappeared...? Uh, what just happened?"</p>
<p>Now that Taion had the time to think, in his thinking stance, "It's likely we're being pursued... But I've never seen a Levnis like that before. Could it be a new model...?"</p>
<p>The group turned to face him, but Noah ended the conversation, "I don't think we'll get very far just theorizing about it. Let's hurry on ahead."</p>
<p>Mio crossed her arms, agreed with him, "Fair enough. But we should stay on our toes, until we leave the woodland."</p>
<p>{{footnote: <a href="./85_segiri.html">For the continuation of this tiny levnis, check this story out.</a> <strong>But a warning</strong>! It contains details that're into the future.

<hr />
<p>As they continued their journey, the series of buildings were still visible behind but getting into the background. Instead, replaced with more trees, leaves colored like late in the Fall under the evening sun; barren ground with occasional grass patches growing stoutly.</p>
<p>Manana stopped on her track, the rest move on unnoticed, not until she shouted, "<strong>Everyone! Is emergency!</strong>"</p>
<p>The group turned to her, with Sena asking, "What's up, Manana?"</p>
<p>"Manana cannot." She shook her head, tears flowed down her eyes like waterfall, "Manana cannot go on like this one extra step."</p>
<p>Noah was perhaps being considerate with her well-being, "We have been walking since Colony Tau, I suppose... If we can find a good place, we'll set up camp, OK?"</p>
<p>Manana eyes lit up immediately, full of energy, "Meh! Plan need more dinner!"</p>
<p>Sena encouraged her to retain the thought as "You can be strong a little longer, can't you, huh? Just a little?"</p>
<p>"Fine! But Manana very very starving today. We need make dinner soon, and everyone must help cook!"</p>
<p>Mio nodded in agreement, "Sure, we'll all be happy to chip in. Right, guys?"</p>
<hr />
<p>As the night falls, the group sat on one side of the bonfire, under a tree with a giant trunk, whom had some undergrowth. The surrounding area was cleared for the bonfire, while further in the distance, grass carpeted the soil.</p>
<p>Mio and Sena were talking to each other, Lanz and Noah, and Eunie, Taion, and Riku sat around a table behind Mio and Sena. To Mio's right were a bunch of turnips and potatoes and whatever ingredients. Manana were to 1 o'clock of Mio. To her left were equipment laid bare, including Taion's teapot.</p>
<p>Manana walked in front of Mio and Sena, humming a tune, "Meh meh meh, meh meh," She jumped up on a table to look at the cooking pot, then her hair jumps on all ends like us having goosebumps, "<strong>GASP! Food is entirely missing!</strong>" Except for the ladle, nothing was inside the cooking pot, licked clean. That did attract the group's attention; she continued to complain bitterly, "Manana not even get single fill of stomach yet!"</p>
<p>"I just saw you stuffing your cheeks!" Lanz instantaneously rebutted.</p>
<p>Taion: "The rations should have been divided equally."</p>
<p>With tears, she seek to emotionally persuade, "Manana walked more than used to today. Tummy was rumbly-grumbly...!"</p>
<p>Eunie stoically replied, "Not much we can do, though. Not now."</p>
<p>Sena walked up and squatted before Manana, looking at her eyes, "Manana... Look, we've still got a way to go, so you're gonna have to get used to rationing stuff out, 'kay?"</p>
<p>"Mehhhh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Everyone laid out their sleeping bags in a semicircle, their head facing the bonfire. At the "base" part of the bonfire, to Lanz's left and Taion's right, were their food (giant turnips ahem) and Taion's tea set on a table. Lanz slept with one leg outside his sleeping bag, touching Sena's; but it didn't disturb her as he didn't touch her, and she's facing the other side anyways. Mio and Noah slept beside each other, with little space between their sleeping bags. Riku and Manana shared a sleeping bag, and given their height, their sleeping bag was arranged horizontally. Eunie and Taion enclosed the final part of the semicircle.</p>
<p>Some Tirkins, animals with bird face, bird wings so stiff it looked like sword with teeth than wings to the translator, quietly sneaked up and purloined their turnips, one by one, quietly and quickly escaped hugging it, waking no one in the process.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the morning rise, the bonfire was put out; smoke continue to rose from the pile of charcoal remains. Sena was stretching as she casually walked by, but something registered in her unconscious to be off, so she reversed back to position, turned her eyes on the sack of food as the smile on her face faded. With an inspecting look, both sacks laid open horizontally on the ground, "<strong>GASP!!! All the food's completely gone!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah jumped up from his lying down position, gasping for breath as he adjusted to the imminent danger. Lanz was already awake and practicing his sword, retorted to her siren, "<strong>WHAZZUP!? What's wrong?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah, now standing up on his feet, questioned in a higher tone, to ensure he listened correctly, "<em>What did you say was gone?</em>"</p>
<p>Mio came up beside him, "I think she was... yelling about food?" They looked at each other.</p>
<p>Eunie exclaimed from the other side, "Wha-? No way! For real?!" They quickly dashed to Sena. As the group gathered, excluding Manana whom couldn't be woken even with fire alarms ringing beside her ears, they examined the sacks.</p>
<p>After a while, Riku questioned calmly, "Friends sure did not just put elsewhere and forget?"</p>
<p>Sena, shaking her heads, replied with a slightly quivering tone, "Nuh-uh, I'm positive it was right here!"</p>
<p>Taion affirmed, "Indeed, I checked it myself before I turned in."</p>
<p>Eunie took a step back, redirected the blame at someone who was very hungry yesterday, "Don't tell me someone scoffed the whole lot?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ugh, no way..." Then, everyone turned to the still happily sleeping Manana.</p>
<p>In her dream words, eyes closing while she turned to her side, "Mmmeeehh... Manana will leave no plate unpolished..."</p>
<hr />
<p>(After she woke up)</p>
<p>She fussed as she fluttered, "<strong>That awful! False accusation!</strong>" Lanz was giving her the ruffled look for her dwelling too long on the topic, "Not even Manana ever stoop to such <em>crude</em> vulgar behavior!"</p>
<p>Lanz gloomily asked, "All right, all right, we get it, just chill out already."</p>
<p>She was adamant. "Manana refuse to become frosty! This now matter of honor and dignity! For starters...!" Sena, Taion, and Eunie walked away, jettisoned themselves from their arguments while perhaps looking for more clues. Noah, Mio, and Riku continued watching the drama between Lanz and Manana.</p>
<p>Noah, his arms on his waist, logically commented, "I know Manana was feeling a bit peckish, but she can't have eaten up the lot"</p>
<p>Mio folded her arms, wondering, "So, who then?"</p>
<p>"Hrmmm..." All the while, Manana and Lanz were quarreling in the background with illegible words.</p>
<p>Eunie was walking off in some directions when she saw a white feather that caught her interest. She squatted down to observe, picked it up, and turned to Mio and Noah, whom turned their attention to her as she called out, "Hey! Check it!"</p>
<p>Noah: "... A feather? But what kind?"</p>
<p>On the other side, Sena squatted over some footprints and shouted, "I found tracks, here!"</p>
<p>Taion ran up to investigate the footprints, remarked, "These footprints... I think they're... Tirkin!"</p>
<p>Still holding out the feather, Eunie: "Mystery solved, then. A Tirkin feather!"</p>
<p>Mio turned to Noah for conclusion, "Sooo... They raided our supplies?"</p>
<p>As the group turned to Manana's group, whom was still furiously baffling Lanz with her hyperactivity,  "Lanz can stuff apology! Honor and dignity of Manana left in tatters from vile and baseless accusation!"</p>
<p>Lanz, scoffed, "C'mon, please, lighten up already..."</p>
<p>Letting them deal with it, Noah turned to the rest of the group and the others turned to him, "All accusations aside, we're really... strapped for food."</p>
<p>Mio suggested, "Guess we'll have to go foraging."</p>
<p>Taion nodded, "I concur." On their path, there was forest, trunks large or small, and grass on the floor, though not very clearly distinguished from the darker soil color. Sunlight aren't as bright as they were, given the leaves blocked some out, as Taion continued, "Luckily, this area is pretty bountiful all in all, so we might not be too hard-pressed."</p>
<p>Noah made the final call, "Well, better get to it."</p>
<p>To which he nodded, "Right."</p>
<p>Mio: "'Kay!"</p>
<p>Riku was ruffled, "Anyway, that clearly too much eat." The group ignored them and walked off in different directions, his voice became the background. "Manana is bottomless pit."</p>
<p>"Meh-meh! Whuh- Will have Riku know Manana is dainty eater!!!"</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, "Not denying!"</p>
<p>Still fluttering, she didn't concur, "Lies! And deceit! On this day of days, Manana will have <strong>retribution</strong>!!!" The final words sounded like echoes through chambers.</p>
<hr />
<p>Also in the forest, someone was panting and running; every step was a torture. Borealis looked back to check for pursuers; none, yet the situation was more than dire. He had hurt his legs, yet he couldn't stop now. He limped his steps therefore.</p>
<p>Alas, pursuers wasn't following, but CCTV tracked him down. O questioned, "Looks like we've got ourselves a runner. Slipped out from the Castle." It was O.</p>
<p>P questioned as they walked towards the Queen's seat, "Is this OK? He could get in touch with Ouroboros... Won't that impact our previous arrangements?"</p>
<p>N was looking at the hologram screen showing Borealis hovering over the Queen's seat, his back facing them, replied, "Not to worry. If he does make contact, they'll come."</p>
<p>"Hah. Really?" She don't believe, folded her arms.</p>
<p>"Ouroboros are... simply like that."</p>
<p>O: "Hmmm..."</p>
<p>P: "Well, if <em>you</em> say so, we can probably take your word. Right, O?"</p>
<p>"Hmmm, certainly. As you said, P. We probably can take his word." N didn't reply.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group gathered under some tree, probably just beside where they camped last night. We could still see the modern buildings in the distant, through the "tunnel" comprised of tree trunks. A pond with clear sprinkling water filled beside the tree. Soily ground around them; further away, we could see short grass.</p>
<p>Noah: "Since we're already out here gathering food, we could think about building up a reserve of stuff that'll keep for a while."</p>
<p>Mio concurred, "That's a good idea. What would that be...? Mushrooms, nuts, that sort of thing?"</p>
<p>Sena nod in her encouraging stance, "I'm on it!" Someone actually lit a bonfire while we weren't looking, the light from the flames caressed the surrounding, which embodied them.</p>
<p>Lanz still doubted, "By the way, when the Tirkins got into our camp, did no one seriously notice?"</p>
<p>Eunie replied affirmatively, "Nope! Not even slightly. Not even a tiny bit."</p>
<p>Riku explained himself, "Riku was busy sawing logs all last night."</p>
<p>Mio felt it was her responsibility, in her appreciation stance, "...I'm sorry, you guys."</p>
<p>Sena explained her away with optimism reasonings, "We'd walked a lot yesterday. I'm sure you were just super pooped. You'd never miss something as obvious as Tirkin footsteps on a good day, Mimi!"</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, declining her assumed responsibility, "I think it's safe to say we were all partially guilty of negligence this time."</p>
<p>Taion agreed, and thought ahead of time, "Indeed. However, we should also reconsider our storage arrangements, for the future."</p>
<p>Eunie shook the blaming off, "Ah well, it's water under the bridge now. No point talking locks after the Ardun's already bolted, am I right? Let's just get to the searching already."</p>
<p>Everyone nodded, and Taion replied, "... Very well."</p>
<p>Something in the distance caught Noah's eyes, as he redirected the group's attention to it, "Hey, is that...?"</p>
<p>They turned and saw a goat{{footnote: Is it a goat? Looks more like mountain goat to the translator.}} with white-ish fur walking down the path in the distance. It seemingly didn't notice them, or maybe it did but care less. It stopped beside a bush under a tree and grazed. To the right where the cliff fell off, we could see more high-tech buildings some distance away from the cliff.</p>
<p>Sena: "An Anlood!"</p>
<p>Perhaps it finished grazing, it kicked some dirt for a while (like how some but not all dogs kicked some dirt after they pee/poop) and ran off into the distance down their targeted route. Lanz looked at the target, suggestively smiled, "It's hard to fill up on mushrooms alone... I say we hunt us some meat, as well."</p>
<p>Sena agreed, showing her muscles, "Woo-hoo! I love me some hunter-gathering!"</p>
<hr />
<p>The location where they were gathering food. The groups gathered in sub-groups of two or three under 3 of the giant trunks. The triangle that they formed, in between them was barren, nothing grows; though the rendering shows something reflected, it may be mirage, but it could be some giant puddle. Outside of the triangle (and beyond the trees) were thick undergrowth of various heights, flowers, some coconut-like (palm?) trees, and a single yellow flower patches in the distance. Noah was seen walking towards Mio's group.</p>
<p>Lanz and Riku as a group, Lanz punched both his fist together before putting his hands below a giant rock; its width about 1.5 times his height, and its height to his waist, a giant rock indeed. As he squatted and exerted forces, the rings on his vest sparkles with electricity. "<strong>Yerrrrrrrrrrrruuuuhhhh!!!</strong>" In a squatted position, he lifted the rock over his head and throw it to his left. It smashed into the ground, sending dirt flying and created a slightly dent crater. "Phew..."</p>
<p>"Much relief! Glad Riku adjust power frame last night. Should perform 30% better than leading brand." He walked and plucked some leaves and tucked them behind him.{{footnote: Unfortunately, although translator saw that kind of plant before, one can't remember where one saw it; and when one saw it, one don't bother to know its names so... shame on me.}}</p>
<p>"Whatcha on about, 'leading brand'? I get that we're weaker than Agnians, so we need this to get on more of an even footing in combat, but..."</p>
<p>"Friend say 'but'. Why 'but'?" He stopped plucking the plants and turned to him. Riku is Riku, he wanted the best reviews from his customers, and he wanted respect for his job.</p>
<p>Turning to face him, "We just need... OOMPH, you know, like? KAPOW, sorta thing!"</p>
<p>"Sound-effects not help comprehension."</p>
<p>Putting his hands behind his heads, "Oh, you know..." He was reminded about Noah unsheathing the Lucky Seven from its shackles, pierced into the Flame Clock. "Like that... doodad Noah has."</p>
<p>"Doo...dad?" He continued to hug the plants and moved them to the two sacks, seemingly full of mushrooms while Lanz continued. And perhaps, since he said Noah, he got what he meant.</p>
<p>"<strong>Oojamaflip!</strong> You know what I mean. Don't make me say it."</p>
<p>"What friend want to use for?"</p>
<p>"Uh...? Well, I..."</p>
<p>"Not on Joran by any chance?"</p>
<p>His eyes wide opened, stuttered as he caught him, "I-I..."</p>
<p>His back facing him, shook his head, "If so, Riku have to pass."</p>
<p>"Aw, come on."</p>
<p>"So Riku guess right." Lanz took a step back; his minds was transparent. Turning to face him, "Backing up, this plan of Lanz... Noah privy to it? Make decision without consult allies? Bad form."</p>
<p>With a poisonous looking eye, "But he's our... enemy."</p>
<p>"And who decide that? Joran ever say himself? That he enemy?"</p>
<p>Quietly replying, "He didn't. <em>I did</em>."</p>
<p>"In absence of complete picture?"</p>
<p>Raising his voice to rebut, "Well, but... He's different...!"</p>
<p>"So, after meet just once, Lanz make up mind?"</p>
<p>"Umph... Then... what're we gonna do?!" He shook his head, uncertainty took over.</p>
<p>"Only things friend can. <strong>Keep moving forward.</strong>"</p>
<p>"How's that gonna solve anything...? Should never have asked..."</p>
<p>Turning away to face the old building, his back on Lanz, "Also... 'Doodad' not that kind of thing." He had high respect for Lucky Seven, eh! To which Lanz made a grumbling noise from his throat for him dwelling on that word.</p>
<hr />
<p>In another search area. Yellow grove and blade grass grows up to knee high, purple/magenta (depending on whether you see it in daytime or nighttime) vines stuck to one side of the tree that allow climbing. The chirping of birds, the calling of cicadas, naturally meant silence to the ears. As before, the group still split into 3 sub-groups, searching different locations.</p>
<p>Mio's wanderlust took her to a direction, scanning her side until something above in front of her caught her eyes. A tree that stretches like cherry blossoms, with green-yellow gourds dangling from the tip of its branch, high up. To Eunie and Manana whom was in her vicinity, she shared her curiosity, "Hey, look! That's a really odd-looking tree."</p>
<p>Manana and Eunie stop whatever they were doing and turned to face her. "Meh?" The shape, the color, triggered Manana's memories as she searched her memories for similarities. Fluttered, she ran past Mio to find any gourd on the ground for closer inspection. Eunie walked up to join her. They looked at each other for a moment, they knew nothing about the "odd-looking tree" nor the "odd-looking fruit", could only join Manana and hope for her experiences.</p>
<p>"Oh, wondrous day!" Her excitement unconcealable as she raised the fruit high up in the air, as if 'releasing kaching kaching light so bright that it could blinds one's eyes'. "Cannot believe eyes! It fruit of legend, Bright Fig!"</p>
<p>"Bright Fig? What's a Bright Fig when it's at home?"</p>
<p>Eunie, with a teasing tone, entered the game of "Lemme guess. They're stupidly delish?"</p>
<p>Manana affirmed, hugging it, "Ohhh, <strong>guaranteed!</strong> Deliciousness is such that friends will be picking up jaws from ground for weeks!" Suddenly, her unconscious caught her conscious, and excitement instantaneously evaporated, "Uh-oh..."</p>
<p>Rolling the Bright Fig she was hugging on the ground in front of her, Eunie was curious, "What's up? Are they rotten or something?"</p>
<p>The peak and the trough of a roller coaster could not describe her journey from excitement to sorrow; which only grew deeper to desolation with limitless tears. "...Tragedy strike. These not ripe for plucking yet, let alone eating. If eat now, bitter flavor cause agonizing death..."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't discouraged, looking up at the tree, "Huh...? I dunno, they look tasty enough to me..." Mio followed her glance.</p>
<p>Manana shared her experience, "Bright Fig not good for eating even after full yellow... Still have to wait another year before able to enjoy..."</p>
<p>Eunie, on hearing the sheer length of time, shrugged, "That's too long! Man, so much for that..."</p>
<p>Hearing her down tone, Mio encouraged, "Never mind. You can always come back next year! It's legendary, right? You wouldn't wanna miss out." She look up to the sky, perhaps trying to imagine the future, or perhaps, imagine a future where she could enjoy with them. Manana's eyes wide opened as she heard her uplifting words.</p>
<p>Eunie didn't immediately realize the timings, "Tch... Guess we'll have to."</p>
<p>Manana remarked in a low tone, "But Mio... Year from now..."</p>
<p>She replied inscrutably, "Mhm, even if I might not get to do it, you guys can still have a taste."</p>
<p>"<strong>Why wouldn't you</strong>- Whoa!" Eunie's subconscious caught up with her conscious, took a step forward that took Mio by surprise, her pupils dilated as she backed a step. Her tone jumped two octave lower as she lectured, "Love, you gotta stop being so detached about it. You'll just get everyone feeling guilty."</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "Oh, sorry, sorry! Please don't mind me."</p>
<p>She abnegated, "Don't mind me, she says... 'Course we're gonna mind you, doll."</p>
<p>Some moment later, they sat under the Bright Fig Tree, perhaps on its roots. They looked at a different direction (of course, given how circular are tree trunks!) with Manana in between, whom closed her eyes; the two sacks of food located in front of her. Whether or not being caught in their thoughts, the rustling wind, cuckooing birds, and chirping cicadas; the aromas of bright yellow flowers; together with the night sky, provides a cultivating bed for anything that has to come, and anything that has to go.</p>
<p>Eunie calmly asked, "Hey, how can you be so casual about it?"</p>
<p>Turning to her, "What do you mean, 'casual'?" Eunie turned to face her, pointed at her breast where her term symbol was.</p>
<p>Turning away, she looked at the floor and the sky as she reminisced, hoping they would take some nervousness away, "I assure you, I'm not. I'm actually pretty flustered."</p>
<p>"You deffo don't look it."</p>
<p>"If it looks that way to you, well, that's because... I shouldn't even be here."</p>
<p>Quietly prompting, "Whatcha mean?"</p>
<p>Taking out her flute and held it with both hands, she softly shared, "This life's a gift, from... a dear friend... It should've been me... I should have died out there that day."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's memories</strong>: Inside a building, seemingly (multiple) T-shaped tunnels, Miyabi was helping Mio, whom injured at least her feet, to move forward. Explosion and flames raged from the junction, but they escaped it. Sitting inside an escape pod, Miyabi spoke her final words to her as she closed the door, closed herself out of her reach. Purple gas now filled the outer atmosphere as the escape pod launched into the distance, its rocket engine flares as it zoomed across its escape tunnel. Mio could only held her hands out, pressed it against the windows, and shouted, "<strong>MIYABIIIIIII!!!</strong>" Flames ignites the purple gas and Miyabi was no more to be seen.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"So this isn't really me. I'm just living on her time. Maybe that's why..."</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." Eunie let her have the conversation she needed to without disturbing, only following her glance on her. As Mio stood up and make a few steps ahead, she pressed the flute to her lips and started playing a melody. It wasn't the Agnian off-seeing melody, an alteration indeed{{footnote: In retrospect, like Crys whom created his Crys's melody, this is Miyabi's Melody.}}. Manana's eyes opened to 'look' at the melody. The single song that strikes the tranquil forest, even birds lowered their chirping and cuckooing frequency, listening to her.</p>
<p>As she finished a short segment, Eunie stood up, accompanied by Manana, approached her and softly spoken, "Somehow, that remind me of us..." Mio put her flute down and turned to them.</p>
<p>Mio connected with her thoughts, "I know. When we're Interlinked, I can see a glimpse. Inferno, destruction... Lanz screaming."</p>
<p>"Noah's memories..." To which Mio nodded. Then, Eunie looked down to presented a recourse, trying to rephrase her words, "<strong>What if</strong>... Bear with me... That friend of yours, she showed up, like Joran?"</p>
<p>"As an enemy?"</p>
<p>"<em>As an enemy</em>."</p>
<p>Her tone quivering, "I suppose... I'd want to know, same as Lanz. Simply... Why?"</p>
<p>"Gotcha. I figured."</p>
<p>She could no longer hold her thoughts to herself, tears aggregating at the tip of her eyes, "Mm... Why is it that you gave your life for mine? Why...? <em>You could've lived longer yourself, Miyabi</em>. Why did you do it?"</p>
<p>"So her name was Miyabi...{{footnote: Eunie don't know about Miyabi, Noah knows a bit from her memories.}}" To which she nodded. "Sorry... Guess it's a sensitive subject."</p>
<p>She shook her head, trying to hold back her tears, "It's funny... I thought I had it all locked down..." Manana held out a handkerchief below her that caught her vision. "Thank you." She bent down and took it to her hands. Eunie patiently waited as she wiped off her tears.</p>
<p>She continued, reflecting determination, "Whatever her reason... I'd accept it. The facts. Whatever the truth may be."</p>
<p>"And that's it? No looking back?"</p>
<p>She nodded, "While my de-facto partner's running full steam ahead? I mean, I can't very well go backwards, can I now?"</p>
<p>Eunie changed to a teasing tone, "<em>You're partners now, eh?</em> Heh, I s'pose you are, at that." She turned to face her left.</p>
<p>"Hm?" Mio's followed her glance, and saw that Noah was rationalizing with Taion while Sena listened in.</p>
<p>Eunie continued, "I wonder... How does he see things?" Behind Sena, there were bamboo sticks grown in groups.</p>
<hr />
<p>Somewhere near but not the original location, under a giant tree, its trunk so huge it looks like a hundred human cannot make a circle that fits the trunk. Even the mushrooms that suck their nutrients out of the tree were huge, some of the stems as tall as Taion, width as buff as Lanz. Their cap could make do a few person shielding from rain. Taion examined some mushrooms and wondered, in his thinking pose, "...Hm? What's this...?"</p>
<p>Sena stood up beside him, "We ate those yesterday, didn't we? Must be lotsa them in these woods..."</p>
<p>"Seems so... Well, that explains it."</p>
<p>Lanz, to his left, prompted him to explain, "What explains what?"</p>
<p>"At first glance, it looks just like a Kelp Mushroom, but in fact... it's what's called a Naiti-Nait, causing overpowering drowsiness when ingested."</p>
<p>"Huh?!" Sena was shocked to hear.</p>
<p>Lanz similarly, "Uh, so you're saying..." Far behind them, there was an Anlood seemingly raising its front limbs and knocking against a tree???</p>
<p>"We ate these, and that's why we all slept clean through the Tirkins stealing our food. That's my working hypothesis, anyway." The Anlood was perhaps tired of knocking the tree now, walked off the scene like how models showed their shirt and walked off the stage. Turning around, before walking off, "I'll go and warn Mio and the others." Lanz and Sena saw him off.</p>
<p>Manana approached them, overhearing their conversations, "Meh mehhh... Was Manana who put in dish... Should have known better..."</p>
<p>Sena tried to take her off her sole responsibility, "We all picked the ingredients together, so it's not like it's you that was at fa-"</p>
<p>She cut her off, "But then Manana blow up on Lanz and say many lots of mean things! Very deeply sorries..."</p>
<p>Lanz just scratched his head as he turned to his side, <em>awkward</em>... "Hey, it's all in the past. More importantly, all this trudging around foraging has given me a wicked appetite. We've got enough now, surely? Let's go back to camp and make it into something edible."</p>
<p>Sena seconded with enthusiasm, "Yeah!"</p>
<p>"Manana agree also!" Her low mood was quick to go, fluttered her wings as she jumped about.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-24"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-24">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="boleariss-tale-ethel-and-cammuravi"><a class="header" href="#boleariss-tale-ethel-and-cammuravi">Bolearis's Tale, Ethel and Cammuravi</a></h1>
<p>Mushroom packed in sacks, giant turnip laying beside. Noah inspected the quantity and quality, stood up and sighed with a relief, "All right then. That should be us good for food now."</p>
<p>The group gathering around, Sena seconded, "Yeah! Looks like that'll last us a little while."</p>
<p>Grass rustling from behind; Mio's sensitive ears first picked up the signal from the background noise. She turned to investigate the direction. Taion was alarmed, "What's wrong, Mio?"</p>
<p>A second sound alerted the group, whom quickly turned and withdrew their blades, with Lanz shouting, "Who's there? Come out!"</p>
<p>Limping, he appeared from behind the bushes. Noah gasped and sheathed his blade, surprised, "Bolearis?"</p>
<p>Holding onto one of his injured leg, he panted hard, unable to speak, finally could catch his breath.</p>
<hr />
<p>A bonfire was lit while the group gathered on one side, surrounding Bolearis, whom was being sat{{footnote: This is funny in French, because it's called <em>je t'assieds</em>, even though that's probably not the right way to use...}} on a chair. Eunie casted a healing ring targeting him. A few moments later, "Yeah, much better... I owe you."</p>
<p>Now that he could speak, Noah initiated the questioning session, "What are you doing over this way? I thought you were going to the Castle?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... No, I went. Annndddd this is what I got for my trouble."</p>
<p>"So, tell us, what happened...?"</p>
<p>He closed his eyes and recall.</p>
<hr />
<p>(Some time earlier...)</p>
<p>Ethel vehemently questioned, "<strong>But why, Your Majesty? Why would you attack Colony 4?!</strong>"</p>
<p>N answered in her stead, "You came into contact with Ouroboros, did you not?" Ethel gasped at his interrogation and, how did he know that? He  continued, "I'd call it... burning out the <em>contagion</em>."</p>
<p>"C...contagion...?"</p>
<p>Borealis retorted "You're implying we've been contaminated?!"</p>
<p>"Have you not? You have been removed from the protection of the Flame Clocks. You no longer need to wager your lives in battle."</p>
<p>The Queen added, "Who struggles not in life, deserves not to live. That is the compact of our nation, and moreover, the truth."</p>
<p>Ethel was disappointed, "Majesty... My Queen..." Her hopes had dwindled.</p>
<p>N continued, "Yet, to punish you all for fate's machinations would be a misstep. Therefore... I shall grant you a chance."</p>
<p>"What must I do?"</p>
<p>"<em>Eliminate Ouroboros</em>."</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, gasping for a second time. He eliminated her hopes; she struggled to reply, "You want me to-... Noah, and the rest...?!"</p>
<p>"Naturally, I am cognizant of the fact that the enemy is wily and capable. I have no intention... of sending you alone." While he was speaking, O and P accompanied someone with silver legged plates coming into the scene from behind Ethel; but she hadn't noticed with N drawing her attention.</p>
<p>Hearing footsteps, she turned and saw O and P stopped, sandwiching him. "Huh! <em>Cammuravi?!</em> Wh-Why are <em>you</em> here...?" The shock she experienced in her whole 9+ terms probably was far less than those experienced on that day.</p>
<p>Cammuravi calmly called out, "Ethel..."</p>
<p>Bolearis was flabbergasted: "H-how? But you're not even on the same side!"</p>
<p>N smiled, "Entertainment."</p>
<p>Both turned to him, Ethel asking for "Pardon?" Cammuravi eyes widened and turned to him, would also like an explanation.</p>
<p>He explained, "Those who have been released from the Flame Clocks sacred indenture... cannot be affected by the Moebius Iris. To bring you back under control, I would have to force your rebirth... But that wouldn't be nearly as fun..."</p>
<p>The Queen added: "The power you two wield surpasses even some of our Consuls. I have great hopes for you... Ethel. Cammuravi... "</p>
<hr />
<p>"They gave Ethel, and Cammuravi, new Ferronises. They've been made, specifically to kill Ouroboros."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In a dark room, Ethel was looking at a giant Ferronis with two huge rings behind each shoulder, some blue lights illuminating from the inner circumference of the ring, and other body parts of the Ferronis. Its head shaped like rabbit, with two conical drill pointed out from both sides where human ears would have been located. Just below its chin, purple flames (neither of Kevesi nor Agnian origin) roared more than half-filled in the Flame Clock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"The tune-up... might take a little while. Though... You don't have much time. The two of them are after your heads." He spoke with a low tone, perhaps tired, or perhaps dejected, or maybe that's just how he spoke.</p>
<p>Noah asked for affirmation, "You're sure of this? Really?"</p>
<p>"That's why I came here. To give you warning. They already know your rough position. That's how I found you in the first place."</p>
<hr />
<p>In a dark room, information transmitted to Bolearis Iris as he asked, "What's this?" There was only some red lights that certainly wasn't use to lit up the room.</p>
<p>Facing him, Ethel replied, "Plans of the Castle. They were tuning up my Ferronis when I 'happened' upon them. They include schematics for the Annihilator. Take them, and go back to Colony 4."</p>
<p>"Commander, you mean...?" Her eyes tightened as she nodded.</p>
<p>"If they can find us wherever we are, I want to at least secure a way for us to put up a fight. Am I wrong?"</p>
<p>"Huh huh huh... But Ma'am, we can't very well-!"</p>
<p>She ignored his rebuffal{{footnote: This word isn't in the dictionary, but one rephrased it based on the word "rebuff". Just like rebuttal is to rebutted.}}, "Also, about Noah's group... If you happen across them, tell them this: I <em>will</em> use lethal force... Yes?"</p>
<p>Bolearis tried to read what she's transmitting via eye contacts. This is the time to test their tacit agreement.</p>
<p>She continued inscrutably, "Furthermore, tell them I wish them all the best of luck, I hope they reach their goal."</p>
<p>"Commander..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Running, he navigated the Castle factory patrolled by levnises and soldiers,{{footnote: This is the Mechon Factory in Xenoblade 1, if you'd played that before.}} checking that they weren't looking as he sneaked through junctions. Before exiting the front entrance, two soldiers were busily chatting and missed him running in the other direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to the present. Sena exclaimed, "Oh, Ethel... She sounds serious..."</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, was touched by her words,  "And still, telling us to just... keep going...?"</p>
<p>Bolearis: "That's Ethel for you. Hard-headed as they come."</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Won't she get into trouble? Because of you slipping out?"</p>
<p>"Hardly... I'm just one missing footsoldier. No one's gonna pay it any mind."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't convinced, "Huh? But your wounds earlier...?"</p>
<p>"Ha - truth is... They're from falling off a cliff on the way here. It was dark as snuff. Hahahahahaha..." Bolearis just laughed it off.</p>
<p>"<em>Are you tuggin' my wings?</em>"</p>
<p>"Well, anyhow. It's nothing for you lot to fret over. This is our problem now. You focus on achieving your objective."</p>
<p>Noah: "We appreciate it." We now could see the a body of water, river or pond, running behind him. We'd expect the lush trees and undergrowth around the area. The bonfire was put out, though some charcoals still had sparks on them; perhaps not long ago it burnt.</p>
<p>"Eh but maaann... Why's the commander gotta duke it out with you lot, eh? And why was our foe Cammuravi there, the <strong>Aspar</strong>? Feels like the whole world's turned on its head." As he stood up, he announced to the group, "All righty. I'm headin' back! Got it? You lot scoot on along out of these parts. There's still some time before they're done tweaking. And with you on foot..."</p>
<p>Noah cut him short, shook his head,  "We're not running away. Not after all this."</p>
<p>"Huh?" He was baffled.</p>
<p>Mio seconded her de-facto partner, "I'm staying too."</p>
<p>Sena turned to look at her, surprised, "What, really?"</p>
<p>"That light we saw, a while back... If that... If that had come from the Annihilator... <em>Even</em> if we were to somehow reach our destination, if it was at the cost of all <em>your</em> lives, it wouldn't be worth it!"</p>
<p>"Hmmmmph..."</p>
<p>Mio continued, "Surviving like that... I couldn't bear it..." She dropped her head as tears started to aggregate.</p>
<p>"Mimi..."</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>Noah turned his glance from Mio and spoke strictly to "Bolearis. The Castle plans, can you share them?"</p>
<p>"Noah... You're not...? You wouldn't..."</p>
<p>"The fact remains - it was <em>us</em> that destroyed your Clock, therefore... "</p>
<p>"Yes, but that's-"</p>
<p>"Either way, I think it's clear at least part of the blame... lies with us. It's only fair, then, that we destroy this 'Annihilator'. Agreed?" Feeling beholden, he turned to look to Mio, whom returned glance and nodded.</p>
<p>Eunie still thought they were kidding, "You for real?"</p>
<p>Lanz, now stood up from sitting on his chair, "I'd be up for a little <em>detour</em>."</p>
<p>Sena: "Same here."</p>
<p>Bolearis looked to them for a few seconds in silence, as Taion the coolheaded added, "You did offer us shelter. That creates an obligation."</p>
<p>Riku added, "No way around! Someone here need to keep friends in line. Count Riku in."</p>
<p>"If plan on fighting, will need first-rate chef too!"</p>
<p>Eunie looked at them all agreeing, and she's the last, "Uhh..." She turned her glance from Manana to Mio, whom was looking on the floor. She remembered what they had spoke before:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>And that's it? No looking back?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>While my de-facto partner's running full steam ahead? I mean, I can't very well go backwards, can I now?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She contemplated, lowering her head slowly during the process, before announcing in a wham-bam-whatever-ma'am{{footnote: One took this and tweak it from 'The Undoing Project' book.}} manner, "...Oh fine, go on then. You wouldn't make it far inside the Castle without a proper Healer, anyway."</p>
<p>In her appreciation stance, Mio was glad of her support, "Eunie..." Taion looked to her, not sure what he was thinking, perhaps surprised she'd make the improbable choice?</p>
<p>Bolearis give in after a few seconds, "Thanks, guys... You're the best."</p>
<hr />
<p>Next morning, a rainy day. Seemingly where they camped before when the tirkins stole their food. The group looked as Bolearis was about to head towards where the giant tunnel made of tree trunks we saw before. At a distance, they were making their final goodbyes.</p>
<p>"I'll head back to Colony 4, in case the shit hits the fan. Good luck then, to all of you."</p>
<p>Noah replied, "Yeah. We'll be all right." Bolearis nodded to him before the group watched him off.</p>
<p>Some distance later, Taion warned, "Remember, we're up against a Castle. Get too close and we may come under fire. What's our plan?"</p>
<p>"I think we'll be able to manage, as long as we're careful."</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Noah's memories:</strong> Metallic floor, night time. Buildings placed around the side of the broad path, so broad levnises could drive through side by side! We could see a levnis parked in the distance, barricade set up that faced the side of the road for no reason. Soldiers speaking with each other. Noah stopped as others walked pass him. Behind, we could see a building emitting purple smoke from its windows. Looking up, he gleaned at the Castle, the pitchfork and dual flame clock at the very top.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lanz recalled with his arms crossed, "Come to think of it, you used to go to the Castle for off-seer training once a year, right, Noah?"</p>
<p>Noah nodded. Taion pressed for more concerns, "The black fog... Is there much there?"</p>
<p>"There's actually quite a bit. Around this time, the whole area is shrouded in it. They couldn't find us in that cave in Nih'l Valley, right?"</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "And you think... we can repeat that?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Taion balanced the probabilities, "Using the fog to approach is clever, but risky... What if an annihilation event occurs?"</p>
<p>"You know, I hadn't really given it much thought up until you mentioned it, but... oddly, it hasn't been happening."</p>
<p>"Seriously?"</p>
<p>He nodded, questioned in a lower tone, "I'm not sure why." Moving on, he touched his temple twice and brought up the Castle plan Bolearis had sent them, continued, "Behind the Castle, there's an ether deposit being mined, in an area facing a lake." That was on an island connected to the castle via a bridge. "The ether being obtained there is then delivered into the Castle through a freight entrance."</p>
<p>The others received the map data on their Iris, with Eunie questioned after she deactivated hers, "So that's where we'll get our sneak on?"</p>
<p>He affirmed, "There won't be anyone in the containers. If we can just get to them, without being spotted..."</p>
<p>Mio looked at him in the eyes, continued his words, "Then we can get into the Castle." He turned to her as she spoke and nodded thereafter.</p>
<p>Sena, in a pose like Taion's thinking mode, tracked the logic, "OK, let's assume we do give the guards the slip. What do we do once we're inside the place?"</p>
<p>Noah called out in a louder voice, "Taion. The sensors. What was the Colony 4 soldiers' search radius, with the fog out?"</p>
<p>"Their scanning range... I'd put in the ballpark of 15 metri."</p>
<p>Noah touched his iris, looked at the map to check the calculations. Moving through the freight entrance in first person view, he signaled, "Look here. In the reserve area, there's a maintenance hatch that leads directly to the outer wall." Pitching up, we could see a ladder-like scaffolding that slanted towards a window. "If we make it through here and get to the main housing... It'll land us in front of the Annihilator." Behind the door was a platform facing their destination; in between the two platforms were some empty space, with a giant ring structure beneath, and some cross section that connect the giant ring with other smaller interior ring, and ring at other levels.</p>
<p>Lanz seemingly agreed, "Less chance of being spotted by troops outside, too."</p>
<p>Sena upvoted, "We can do this."</p>
<p>Taion reconsidered for any unthought concerns and raised, "There's one concern. The Castle is the Queen's residence. What if we're found by the Consuls?" It's funny, they look at each other while looking at their maps, hands still on their temple.</p>
<p>Noah replied, "Then I guess... we'll have a fight on our hands." Raising his voice, "But it's not like we don't have a retreat. Here." He plotted a route from a window just behind where the Annihilator was positioned. That window zig-zagged across and brought them to the opposite end of the Castle.{{footnote: Okay, somewhat opposite end, though not perfectly lined.}}  "In Keves, after a Homecoming... They wash away the belongings of the dead, as part of a ritual. It's an understated affair. And the channel they use for it... is here. It flows straight out, connecting to the lake outside the Castle." The lake was a small island, below the exit of the 'river', the island so small it seems insignificant compared to the size of the Castle.</p>
<p>"I see... So, we open a hatch near the Annihilator, ride the current, and we <em>should</em> come out right at the lake." Noah nodded back as they deactivated their Iris.</p>
<p>Eunie was complaining on the meantime, picking the tip of her wings as she spoke in a high tone, "More snuffin' water. <em>Every time we run... why do we always end up getting drenched?</em> I mean... Feathers are a bitch to dry."</p>
<p>Sena just smiled back at her, while Lanz crossed his arms and rebutted, "Every time being our grand total of once."</p>
<p>Noah joined in, "Well, let's just hope we don't have to fight. That's the ideal case."</p>
<p>Mio: "That's it, then."</p>
<p>"<strong>Mmm</strong>. Ready whatever supplies you need. Then we can go."</p>
<hr />
<p>Birds chirping from where the group were about to travel down a huge tree trunk/root that swivels toward the bottom layer of Maktha Wildwoods. The modern dilapidated buildings had their ground floor{{footnote: The translator read about UK calling ground floor ground floor, but US called it first floor; but that was from a book in the 1970s, not sure if they'd changed it or standardized it. Anyways, one used the UK format, so one don't know; though this book is written with English US ahem ahem.}} located on the bottom layer. Purple liquids, presumably poisonous, filled large area of the lands below, creating purple lakes. The lack of ventilation contained the mist in the area. Looking down, Eunie said to Lanz and Riku, feeling dissuaded, "Er, are we really going this way?"</p>
<p>Lanz replied, "I can't see any other way to the Castle, can you?"</p>
<p>The others were waiting for Taion to check the map, perhaps for an alternative route. As he deactivated his Iris, he turned to Noah and shook his head, whom commented, "I don't want to drag our feet getting there. Be careful crossing through, yeah?"</p>
<p>Eunie dropped her head, effetely replied, "Are you joking me..."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "Afraid of heights, huh?"</p>
<p>She snapped back, "Not afraid as such, but if we fell from here, we'd, like, die? Instantly?!"</p>
<p>Punching her fists on to the air, "If Manana think something tasty waiting on other side, then Manana can be brave." Sena nodded her head in her encouraging stance. Eunie just dropped her head one more time.</p>
<p>Taion commented, "If we can make it across, we'll almost be out of Maktha Wildwood."</p>
<p>Mio: "Just one more hop to Keves Castle."</p>
<p>Noah turned to look back at the modern dilapidated building, the group followed his glance to check out what he saw, as he remarked, "We'll probably have quite a good view of it from over there."</p>
<p>Well except for Eunie, whom contemplated and compromised, "Fine, fine, I get it! Let's just get this over with!" Then, she led the way as the group followed, hoping to quickly get the snuff out of there.</p>
<hr />
<p>To the right of Ethel's Ferronis laid Cammuravi's. It had a crescent horn, seemingly wearing a coat, and the flame clock also of purple origin, except they're burning clockwise; while Ethel's burned anticlockwise. There were some platforms that allowed reaching the torso of the Ferronis.  Cammuravi and Ethel were standing below in between their Ferronises.</p>
<p>Not looking at each other, though standing at a distance side by side, Ethel started the conversation, "Of all the ways we could meet again, it ends up being this. The irony of it all."</p>
<p>"We are bound. That is how I see it."</p>
<p>"Bound? That certainly sounds like you. You're talking about..."</p>
<p>Closing his eyes, he replied, "Fate. I think, that is how you would put it."</p>
<p>Looking down to think for a moment, before looking up seemingly into the sky but perhaps at her Ferronis, "Fate, you say..." Then, turning to look at Cammuravi, she questioned, "Why? Why did you agree? To be reborn?"</p>
<p>He turned to her, "So you know?"</p>
<p>"There were rumors. That you were imprisoned. That you took the blame for the Colony's seizure."</p>
<p>"It was only fitting."</p>
<p>Reminiscing their battle, Ethel continued, "Perhaps I should have killed you there and then."</p>
<p>But he hadn't got much time left. The central dot was the only red, but his was even fainter than Mio's.{{footnote: Translator don't know if Homecoming is once per year, or once per month, or what frequency it's held at. But later, we know it's held during an eclipse, but is eclipse even happening once in every n years or something?}} "Only through death... can our feud be resolved." Looking up at his Ferronis, "In a way, I am grateful. Now that I have been blessed with a Ferronis, and another chance."</p>
<p>"Another chance..." she looked back at her Ferronis. She recalled her speech with P when she brought her to her Ferronis earlier.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A Ferronis? This is for me?"</p>
<p>"Absolutely. It's been tailor-made to suit your every need. The same goes for his Ferronis... So, you'd better make the most of it, with what life you have left, hm?" The room was dark, but two beams of light shone, one on Ethel's, another on Cammuravi's.</p>
<p>"Huh..." She didn't spoke anything, but looking back at her Ferronis, she gasped as something shocked her, caught her attention.</p>
<p>"You've noticed! Good girl. I guess they don't call you Silvercoat Ethel for nothing. What a clever thing you are." Turning to the Flame Clock, she explained, "Those ones are a bit special. They're tied to both yours and Cammuravi's lives."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>"The more the two of you get heated up, the more your power grows! Ahh! Doesn't that <em>sound sublime</em>? Even though you're released from the struggle of life, your precious life force... will connect straight to <strong>Origin</strong>."</p>
<p>She tried to read whatever signals she may had conveyed, didn't questioned what is Origin, and just looked back at her Ferronis. The purple flame clock roars up to three-quarter of the gauge, searing hot.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back to the present, we could see behind them were soldiers and levnises patrolling the area, seemingly not noticing Cammuravi being an Agnian? Cammuravi directed a question to Ethel, "Ouroboros... They showed me their image, but just who are they? They seemed like soldiers from Keves and Agnus, but are they human?"</p>
<p>Closing her eyes, she replied succinctly, "They're hope."</p>
<p>"Hope?"</p>
<p>"Dreams... Desires... The future. Yes... They are hope, personified."</p>
<p>"Indeed? They are your hope?"</p>
<p>"They are everyone's hope... Yes."</p>
<p>Their tacit agreement don't even require them to speak their intention clearly to make their final decisions, "I see... Then there's only one choice."</p>
<p>"Yes. Only one."</p>

<p>Unrepaired roads, buildings with their metal grids{{footnote: Roads, buildings, all have metal grids within the cement to support them, if you don't already know.}} sticking out from its walls. As the group reached the ledge, the Keves Castle a silhouette in the distance. Trees filled the landscape below them and in front of their vicinity; a giant tree the size of Yggdrasil to the right of the picture. There were some lower storey rectangular buildings at the lower level in front that seemingly encased an outdoor area within it, now overgrown with trees. In between the forest and the castle seemed like a sea. The group stopped overlooking the scenario.</p>
<p>Mio commented, "There's Keves Castle... It'll still take a while on foot."</p>
<p>Noah turned to the group, "We'll rest here today, then head out at first light." Eunie nodded back.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and Taion stood beside the bonfire, speaking. Manana was speaking with Eunie, while Riku helping Sena with sit-ups. Lanz and Mio were in a distance, cleaning up the dishes. The moon gleamed dimly in the distance. As Lanz passed the dishes to her and she scrubbed them under running water{{footnote: God knows where do they have piped water in the middle of nowhere.}}, and passed back so he could rubbed them with a towel.</p>
<p>Mio tried to start a conversation, "What a relief. I was worried, about the water." She handed him a plate, he took it first before passing another plate to her, only then he rubbed it dry. He didn't answer her comments.</p>
<p>As she tried to change hands, her grip on the plate got loose and it fell onto the floor.{{footnote: It sounded like glass, but it didn't break!?? Bulletproof glass plate it is.}} "Ughhh..." The plate reverberate for a moment before coming to a rest.</p>
<p>Lanz, alerted, turned to her, concerned, "You all right?"</p>
<p>"Y-yeah! My hand slipped. I better wash this again." She squatted down and picked it up, continued the washing, ending the conversation stiffly. He didn't believed; she had been losing strength for the past few days.</p>
<p>"Hm..."</p>
<hr />
<p>The moon shone between the clouds. Sitting herself on an elevated rock overlooking the moon, her mind wasn't on the scenery. She tried to feel the flute she held on her hands while she looked forward, lost in thought. Occupied, she looked down as she held up her right palm, questioned, "Am I... losing feeling?" She moved her fingers, attended to its dexterity{{footnote: from the word 'dexterous', one wanted to call it dexterousity but oh well...}}. Is it still moving as one want? Is it growing weaker? Is it numbing? Is it less dexterous? Then, she gently caressed where her term symbol was, uncertain of her days left.</p>
<p>Noah interrupted her private time, sounded from behind, "Tomorrow, we'll finally reach the Castle lands. I want us to be at our readiest. We should run one final check of everyone's equipment." She turned and saw her stopped by a distance behind. Turning back and curled forward, with a quivering tone, she signaled indirectly,</p>
<p>"Fine for you, isn't it? All that... time you've got."</p>
<p>"Hm?" He tilted his head to try make sense on what she's trying to convey.</p>
<p>"We keep taking this at such a casual pace. Now Swordmarch... seems so distant."</p>
<p>"Mio?"</p>
<p>"What am I even doing...? I can't..."</p>
<p>As his eyes glanced left and right, finding the logic to persuade her, "You still have two months left. If we take care of this now, we can ensure the Colonies' safety. Just maybe, we can make an ally of people in the Castle. It'll make getting to Swordmarch a bit easier-..." He tried the logical approach when Mio felt visceral, and the result? Altercation. The more he spoke, the more stones pressed against her heart, and she gripped her hands, clenching it into a fist slowly, now free of holding her flute...</p>
<p>Stood up, she turned to him and retorted, "'<strong>Still</strong>'? It's two months! Might as well be nothing!"</p>
<p>His eyes looked left and right for a rebuttal, "But... I... You did... agree to do this..."</p>
<p>"Well, yeah, but... I know I did, but..."</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence between as they were considering how to deal with the situation. Noah still prefer the logical way of persuasion. He turned away from looking at her, feeling uneasy as he searched for the 'right' words, "Look, I know... it was a snap decision. I understand why you're upset. Let's just... take it easy tonight, take a moment to breathe."</p>
<p>Her lips shuddered. He clearly didn't understood. Her emotional needs was replaced by an inferior logical needs. On the verge of tears, mind hijacked, she snapped back, "Why wouldn't I be upset? Take <strong>what</strong> easy? We rest today, and tomorrow... Before I know it, <em>it'll be time</em>... <strong>And then I'll be...</strong>"</p>
<p>"I mean, I get that, but we-" He took two futile steps forward.</p>
<p>As her tears leaked, she closed her eyes and drooped her head, cut him off, "You don't <strong>get it! Not at all!</strong>" And he watched her running off into the alleyway to her right.</p>
<p>He was still confused, "What the spark...?"</p>
<p>Some moments passed by and Sena approached from behind, prompted, "Noah, do you... D'you think you're perfect?"</p>
<p>He turned to look at her, "Huh? How could I be perfect? I'm just a regular guy."</p>
<p>"Right? Even Mimi has her faults. We're only human. The truth is, she's terrified. She needs someone to tell her. That everything will be all right. I mean, <strong>you</strong>." He waited for her next sentence, "Never seen her like this. Poor Mimi... She actually... tells you stuff." She looked to her side, <em>probably</em> expressing her envy.</p>
<p>Looking to the alleyway where she ran off, he commented, "I have seen her thoughts, you know."</p>
<p>She rejected his remark, "Nuh-nuh-nuh, I'm not talking about any of that. She just... needed to vent."</p>
<p>"She did?"</p>
<p>Biting her tongue as she put up a smile, "I'm actually kinda jealous..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You're an off-seer, Noah. I thought you were sharper than this."</p>
<p>"What's that supposed to-"</p>
<p>She took a step towards him; they're now separated by half an arm length, asking for his action, "You better give her a good apology later, you hear? (short pause) Got it? Promise me that."</p>
<p>Confounded, he stuttered while sorting out the heads and the tails of the situation, "Uh... Sure..." He nodded his head involuntarily, and Sena, getting his promise, turned and ran off after Mio.</p>
<p>All the while, Lanz and Taion (and his Mondo) sat at his tea table, watching the scene from afar. Artificial light sprinkles a light orange hue on their body surface.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, uh... You can count me out for any of that."</p>
<p>Holding his teacup, "Huh?" Putting it down, "Well... maybe..." His mondo drooped hearing the doubts in his tone.</p>
<p>Lanz turned to him, pressed further, "'Maybe'...? What you mean?"</p>
<p>His fiery eyes made him felt anxious. Quickly turning to look at the side and pushing his glasses up, "Er, uh... forget it!"</p>
<p>Lanz slightly nodded, wasn't convinced. Taion turned back at him, logically explained himself, "In any case, it has no bearing on our objective."</p>
<p>"Too right... We'll get all of this done, then next stop: the City." As he speak, he turned his body to face towards him.</p>
<p>"Right. For Mio's sake."</p>
<p>"Hehehehe..." Lanz sudden laugh interrupted Taion.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Smiling, "First time we've agreed on something, eh?"</p>
<p>"It is?"</p>
<p>"Hey!" He held up his right palm to ask for a high five, vibrating it forward and backward to show his intention.</p>
<p>He wasn't convinced, even though he know what it means. "What's that in aid of?" The Mondo tilted its torso to its left, wandering.</p>
<p>"Do the right thing. Come one." He continued reverberating his palms while inviting him.</p>
<p>Yet, he refused to put himself below first class logic. "Wh-... Sorry, but I refuse to debase myself like this!" His mondo shook it's torso left and right. Then, he stood up and walked away from the uneasy atmosphere, his Mondo floated behind.</p>
<p>Still had his hands held out, he dropped it down, whatever: "All right. You be that way." Disappointed, he rested his heads on his palm, his arms rested on the table. But his eyes and raised lips clearly showed he wasn't <em>too</em> disappointed; at least he took a step towards the illogical, yes?</p>
<p>The moon continued to stay unchanged, be the humans on the ground happy, sad, angry, worried; none of its business.</p>

<p>As the morning sun rise, smoke rose from the pile of burnt charcoal. Eunie approached the yellow-orange morning sunlight with a nice stretching, and an extended yawn! Lanz and Sena were already training, legs together, hands behind their heads, their legs swing up and down, one count towards the left, another count towards the right. Riku approached Manana in the meantime.</p>
<p>"Mmeeehhh...."</p>
<p>He flapped his wings on her belly, called out, "Manana."</p>
<p>In her dream words, "Cannot possibly eat portion of Riku...", she turned to the side away from Riku.</p>
<p>Riku wasn't impressed, suddenly jumped up and grabbed her and shook her, "<strong>Mmeh</strong>... No more snooze! Sun already hang high in sky!"</p>
<p>Taion had activated his iris and studied some map while Eunie approached and sat at the side of the table in front of him, looking at him. She saluted to him, to which he nodded back to her, deactivated his iris while holding his cup of tea, and started chatting. The morning light reflected off the shiny floor.</p>
<p>Noah was practicing his swords in the morning, as usual, alone, near the edge where he and Mio had an argument the night before. His breathe and shouts was especially loud today, and with exceptional strength he slashed the air. As he completed his set, he sheathed his blade and looked at the morning sun.</p>
<p>Footsteps approaching from behind, she sounded calmly from behind, "Sorry about... last night. I was just feeling the pressure."</p>
<p>He turned to his left as she stopped beside him, looking at the morning sun that give hope to another day. He apologized in return, eyes facing to the bottom left, not daring to look at her, "I should be sorry. I didn't realize." He searched his mind for the right words to reconciliate with her, to attend to her emotions, "...It must be tough for you, I'm sure."</p>
<p>She turned to face him with a smile, and slowly took out her flute, grabbed it with both hands strongly, shared its story, "This, uh... belonged to a friend. We served in the same colony. She was my off-seer partner. Miyabi, was her name."</p>
<p>His hands in his pocket, he moved his body to face her directly, curiously asked, "So your off-seers... sometimes work in pairs?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. You know, I was surprised. When you joined in, and played alongside me back then." That was the first time when they sent Guernica home. She continued, "Anyway... One day, there was an experiment... And she... She told me to keep on living."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Miyabi held her flute out to Mio just before she closed the door to the escape pod.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"To live life in her stead. To fight on. But..." she tighten her grip on her flute, paused for a moment to refrain her tears from overflowing, looking straight into his eyes, "<strong>The stupid thing is... I was the one... who was... older than she was.</strong>" Closing her eyes, emotions overwhelmed, tears overflowed.</p>
<p>Noah was recalling what he saw in her memories as he let her cry. "Now I see... That was..."</p>
<p>A few moments later, she rubbed away her tears, taking a small step forward as she made up her mind, invited him, "<strong>Say...</strong> Wanna... exchange flutes?"</p>
<p>He was confounded, "What? But isn't that..."</p>
<p>She felt a little disappointed as her hope dwindled at the sudden snap decision, "I guess it's a little too... icky?"</p>
<p>He violently shook his head instantaneously, "No no, I-I don't care about that! I'm just trying (to say){{footnote: The one in bracket, Mio had cut him off while his voice dampened...}}..."</p>
<p>Feeling distraught and cutting him off, "I'd just like it... to be used a little longer." Holding the flute up to her chest, "To make up for the time Miyabi lost..." Then, she turned her look from the flute to look into his eyes, "You'll still be around after me."</p>
<p>"Mio..." He contemplated for a moment, "I get it. <em>All right. It's a trade.</em>" With uplifting tone, he shared while taking out his flute, "You should know, mine's seen better days too."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, I don't really mind either."</p>
<p>Both held out their flutes with both hands, the sun witnessing; he took hers with his right hand, she received it with both. She put Noah's flute close to her heart as she embraced, and he examined hers.</p>
<p>"Thank you. For the chat. I'm kind of surprised."</p>
<p>"Surprised?"</p>
<p>"Even after Interlinking, there's still things I don't know about you."</p>
<p>"Well, of course! How can you when there are things I don't understand myself? You're not going to pick up on everything."</p>
<p>Slanting his body forward towards her, "Got to put into words first?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, <em><strong>but it doesn't always work</strong></em>{{footnote: One give three upvotes on this, very very true. Words don't always works. Actually, sound is the most important channel of transmission of messages; even then, we could never transcribe what he really feel into words, sounds, and body language all together perfectly.}}, even then..."</p>
<p>"Like last night?"</p>
<p>"Oh, that? That was me being selfish. But now, I feel like we're starting to get... on the same wavelength{{footnote: Do they study physics? So they knew about wavelength?}}."</p>
<p>He gave a gentle nod as he thought about what to say, before suggesting, "Maybe Interlinking... just helped that along. <em>To bring us a little closer together.</em>"</p>
<p>"Maybe, yeah. That might just be it." As she finished, she turned to look at the morning sun, now rising higher in the horizon as it signifies another day. Noah followed her glance, looking at the sea of mist that enshrouded the trees below their platform, their flutes in their hands.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-26"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-26">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="ethel-and-cammuravi-o-and-p"><a class="header" href="#ethel-and-cammuravi-o-and-p">Ethel and Cammuravi, O and P</a></h1>
<p>Continuing their journey on some barren war-torn land, Mio's ears fluttered as she heard something, alerting the others, "What's that sound?!"</p>
<p>To describe the environment, behind them, they just descended from a slanted platform. There were trees and some grass to the side. Turning to their right, where the booming sound echoed louder, stood a giant boulder taller than the trees. To its right stood the old building structure. To its left, we could see the Castle's silhouette (still) in the distance, plus some other trees and rocks.</p>
<p>Looking up, they saw Ethel's and Cammuravi's Ferronises standing atop the boulder.</p>
<p>Noah exclaimed, "Ferronises!" The Ferronises took a few steps forward before gently dropping onto the ground in front of them, sending dust blowing in their direction; they were forced to face sideways to shield against them entering their eyes. As they cleared, the group watched the Ferronises "unbent" their knees.</p>
<p>From within, Ethel voice echoed via an invisible speaker towards the group, "I told you life is short, but I didn't mean it like this! Noah, Mio."</p>
<p>Noah: "That voice... Ethel?!" To prove his prediction, Ethel climbed out of her Ferronis, stood on top of it. Noah then turned to the fiery Ferronis, "Ethel... But then who's the other one?"</p>
<p>Sena: "That one? It's from Agnus, right?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I recognize the crescent moon crest... Cammuravi's piloting that thing." Cammuravi also climbed out of his Ferronis to show his face, standing in front of the Ferronis's head.</p>
<p>Noah: "Cammuravi... That's him... Ethel's sworn rival..."</p>
<p>Mio: "But why? How did they get them to work together?"{{footnote: Borealis already brought the news? Unsure why they felt so shocked when they themselves are working together... And they know Ethel and Cammuravi's stories anyways; if she didn't kill him, it's not too difficult to understand they could work together.}}</p>
<p>As they were thinking, P sounded as she and O teleported in front of the Ferronises, "Flitting like moths... to a flame. N's predictions are nothing to be sniffed at. Gotta hand it to him."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Urghhh... Anyone else wanna show up?"</p>
<p>Noah was more concerned with the new moebius she introduced to them,  "N?"</p>
<p>"Hehhhhh...." Putting his arms on his waist, O commented, "I'm afraid this is about as far as you go. Terribly sorry, chums!"</p>
<p>Sena remarked, "I know who he is. He's the Consul from Colony Zeta! I remember him from a... joint operation."</p>
<p>Eunie guessed, "Then I guess this one's meant to be... from our side then, is she? Never seen her before."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Probably. So the Consuls are colludin' as well? Something's really starting to smell."</p>
<p>Taion: "I concur."</p>
<p>Ethel continued, her voice loud and clear, "I thought that my message to you was crystal clear."</p>
<p>Noah exited his defensive stance as he replied, "Yes, we heard you."</p>
<p>Mio added: "That's why we're here!"</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, "Hm. I thought so." Reopening it, "I had a hunch that this would be the path Ouroboros chose to follow."</p>
<p>Noah: "I don't suppose... you'll step aside for us?"</p>
<p>"Wishful thinking. Give it up." She turned as she re-entered her Ferronis. Cammuravi spoke no words and followed after her the same action.</p>
<p>"Well, then... We'll do whatever it takes." Together with Mio: "For the Greater Good!" And they both withdrew their weapons. Not the others, though.</p>
<p>Ethel, from inside her Ferronis, swung her dual blades as she replied, "Well spoken! Then I say the same to you!" The dual blades of her Ferronis glowed in cyan after she activated the blades.</p>
<p>Cammuravi spoke for the first time, "Off-seers from Keves and Agnus... Fate binds us... I bear none of you ill will, but my Way demands we fight!" Pointing his lance at them, inside and outside, flares burning from the tip of the lance, releasing sparks, "Come then... and test your mettle against my lance!"</p>
<p>Sena: "You've gotta be joking!" The group <em>still</em> haven't called their weapons yet!</p>
<p>Eunie never stop complaining when she sees the chance, "Mudder! I'm not testing anything against that! What happened to fighting fair?!"</p>
<p>Taion logically replied to her, "We won't get anywhere complaining! Ready yourself, Eunie!"</p>
<p>"Ready, he says..." She took a look at Mio whom was to her 10 o'clock, whom was focusing on Ethel and Cammuravi. Perhaps remembering their conversations earlier below the Bright Fig tree? Then she exclaimed, "From the moment I chose this muddy path, I've been <strong>more than ready</strong>!"</p>
<p>Taion had the time to stood up and pushed his glasses, "Hah! Oh, I know."</p>
<p>Eunie turned to him in, angry eyed, "Then whatcha say it for? Arsehole!"</p>
<p>Lanz stopped them from continuing their drama, withdrawing his blades as he shouted to them, "Zip it, guys. Get ready! They're here!" The others followed with calling their blades after him.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah's Ouroboros dashed towards Ethel's Ferronis before the former jumping up and meeting swords. Ouroboros are puny, compared to Ferronises. Despite the sheer size, Ethel's was no slower than Noah's.</p>
<p>"Whoa! How is it so... fast? Can't find any way to... get inside! Hah!" He dragged backward with their last exchange.</p>
<p>Ethel was in no better position, either. Electrical sparkles around "The joints... Their sheer power really is something to behold..." The control room was blinking red, while a triangle in front of her screen tried to lock onto Noah's, whom was dashing towards her again. "Noah... Mio..."</p>
<p>"Urrrrrrahhhhhh..." Lanz's Ouroboros dodged a strike from Cammuravi's Ferronis's lance as he dashed forward, jumped up and landed on top of its head. Then, fired an art that emanates multiple beams from a ring forward, pushing Cammuravi's back. He regained balance quickly, turning his lance to deflect incoming bullets.</p>
<p>"Gah! No good, eh?" Soaring low above the ground, she dodged just before Cammuravi's lance strikes.</p>
<p>"Good coordination. I'd be done for, if it weren't for this Ferronis." He readied for another blow while Eunie's drifted backwards.</p>
<p>"Thanks for the <strong>compliment!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena took control while Cammuravi was busy poking Eunie; and Taion took over the moment he successfully landed a hit, splitting into multiple paper mondos. Ethel and Cammuravi were fighting back to back, while the Ouroboros frequently changed their targets.</p>
<p>While the fighting continued, Taion called out, "Noah."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I think this is the decider. OK... Let's do it."</p>
<p>"Yeah... We've got this."</p>
<p>A distance from the scene, O and P were watching{{footnote: O sitting on a protruding rock, while P stood beside him.}}. P stepped her feet on the ground, impatiently remarked, "Come on, what are they playing at?! Am I crazy? We gave them Ferronises and everything! They had better not be holding back."</p>
<p>O: "You think they might be underestimating us? <strong>Us</strong> of all people?"</p>
<p>"Listen, O. Ethel's a lost cause. But Cammuravi... We could use him."</p>
<p>"Cammuravi? Hoh, I get what you're saying! You know, I forgot we even had that option! Hmm..." He stood up, excited, and put a 'frame'{{footnote: That's what picture-man or photo-man do, when they don't have a camera. They aimed their index finger and thumb 90° to each other into a gun shaped, and joined them so they shape like a frame.}} around their fighting scene. With his left Iris glowing Moebius, he called out, "Now, see the enemy before you? Use every last ounce of strength, and grind them to dust!"</p>
<p>That makes Cammuravi groaned in pain, his Ferronis knelt with one leg on the ground, supporting itself from falling with its lance. Ethel heard his pain and felt concerned, "What's wrong, Cammuravi?"</p>
<p>As he continued groaning, his iris glowed red, O's voice sounding within his head, "Look, you can see your enemy right there!"</p>
<p>"Enemy? Th-That is... My... Enemy...?" Ouroboros shrouded in black fog, red eyes, abhorrent creatures. "Enemy... Enemy! <strong>Enemy!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Cammuravi? What's wrong with you?! Cammuravi!" Then, she remembered something. Looking towards where O and P was, she saw what he was doing. "Oh no! The Iris... I knew it. <strong>Cammuravi!</strong>"</p>
<p>His two fingers already pointing at his red Iris; the Ferronis's lance struck the air. "Urrrrrrrrahhhhh!!!" As he took deep breathe quickly, he slowly lowered his left hand, his palm enclosing his eyeball. Closing his left iris{{footnote: to reduce blood flow}}, his right shone with determination. "This is... I am... I am <strong>under no one's yoke</strong>!"</p>
<p>Ethel's eyes widened by his action, "Cammuravi, you... you really... Your own eye..."</p>
<p>"I will be as they are! I am... <strong>I am free</strong>!" He exclaimed as he pointed his lance forward.</p>
<p>"Free..." She thought about it for a moment, elated, "<em>You're right... We're free!</em> <strong>Free! The two of us!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah, hearing them out, was confused, "What are you saying? Ethel, what's...?"</p>
<p>Cammuravi snatched her attention, "Attend, Ethel!"</p>
<p>She tacitly knew what they wanted, "Yes! Our dream will not perish!" Previously back to back, they ran a distance, turned, and started fencing each other.</p>
<p>Lanz was confused, "Uh? What the snuff's going on?!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Are the Consuls doing this?!" They stood watching their battle.</p>
<p>Mio was the first to link the dots, "No! This is... It's what <em>they</em> want!"</p>
<p>Ethel seconded her, fighting as she spoke elatedly, "Absolutely right, Mio!"</p>
<p>"Ethel?!"</p>
<p>"Ever since I met you all, I have admired you!"</p>
<p>"Admired us?!"</p>
<p>"Your freedom! I bless the fortune I have had... in meeting all of you! You have... my gratitude!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Gratitude?"</p>
<p>Cammuravi explained, "This feeling of elation... Liberating, is it not?"</p>
<p>"I feel it too, Cammuravi!"</p>
<p>P stomped her feet once, "Wh- what are they fighting each other for?! O?" She turned to look at him.</p>
<p>His hands was shaking, his iris was still glowing. As he tried to pluck the strings, it didn't work as he'd expected. "<em>Uhh... I-I can't believe this! He... He won't listen to any of my commands</em>!"</p>
<p>Noah called out{{footnote: Himself enshrouded in dust from the Ferronises stepping on the ground.}}, he don't understand, "Ethel! Why in flames do you have to fight each other?! We're supposed to be your enemies."</p>
<p>"I told you, Noah. Observe. This here is the purpose of my life! Just know... You were the ones who finally opened my eyes!"</p>
<p>P desperately shouted at them, "Stop this! Stop it this instant! Ethel! Cammuravi! Uhhh!!! <em>In that case</em>...!" She activated her iris, and lives start to be drawn away from their Flame Clocks.</p>
<p>Sena exclaimed as she noticed, "Their Flame Clocks!!!"</p>
<p>Taion, referring to the 'lives', "This is weird! Look at the way the light is moving!"</p>
<p>"Is that... Is that their life force we're seeing?" From within the control chamber, 'lives' were escaping from both person, but they didn't care a bit.</p>
<p>P was furious. Her effort didn't incur what she wanted; but she couldn't do anything else except snapping at them, "<strong>Have you gone completely insane? You were supposed to kill Ouroboros!</strong> <em>So stop this senseless fighting and obliterate those brats!</em>"{{footnote: Meanwhile, O was still shaking, still haven't stop trying to control Cammuravi.}} She then changed into a threatening tone, clenching her fist as if to squash their hearts, "If you don't... I'll take your precious little life, and drain it dry!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wha- Did you hear that?!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh, I knew it. So they really can drain their life! <strong>Ethel! Cammuravi!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Noah! We have to kill the Consuls!"</p>
<p>"You're right!" He immediately made a dash for it, but Ethel stopped him with one of her (Ferronis's) feet, while she was blocking Cammuravi's lance from pressing down with both swords crossed,</p>
<p>"It's OK, Noah... It's <em>over</em> for us now."</p>
<p>He wouldn't give up convincing, "That's rubbish! <strong>Ethel</strong>!"</p>
<p>Mio: "This is wrong. All of this is wrong! There's no reason for you two to be fighting each other!"</p>
<p>Ethel: "Ugh! You might not understand now,... but someday you will. This is what I... This is what, <em>both</em> of us want!"</p>
<p>Noah's took a few steps forward as he questioned, "How can... How can any of this be what you want?! <strong>You're both gonna die!</strong>"</p>
<p>"What we leave you is more important! All our aspirations... You must keep them in your hearts! You must take them... Make it all mean something! You have to live... <strong>You must live on!</strong>" She then break the shielding position, which had been going on for a while, and continued exchanging blows.</p>
<p>As she felt it's time, they backed up some distance, Ethel crossed her sword into a plus (+) shape, for a final round, "Here I come, <strong>Cammuravi</strong>!"</p>
<p>"Let us cross blades, one last time!" "<strong>Aaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh</strong>!" Both shouted as they released all their strength for their final blow, given up their defenses, and struck each other's Flame Clock, ending their own lives. Till death, they stayed standing. They could no longer hold their lives, it escaped and saturated their vicinity, as the elated two reddened and lost their flesh, their clothing remains fell onto the ground.</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>Ethellll!!!</strong>" The group stopped for a moment, watching their lives floating towards the air. After it died down, she and Noah cancelled their Interlink, "Huh... Ethel..."</p>
<p>O and P had calmed down. They couldn't reverse their death, no use staying heated. P: "Tsk. Well, didn't they come in handy? What was N thinking, picking those reckless hotheads?"</p>
<p>Both slowly moving towards the scene while chatting, O: "Hmm... Good grief. Looks like... we're just gonna have to wipe out this lot ourselves!"</p>
<p>"You scumbags..." Looking at them angrily, Noah scolded.</p>
<p>P: "Fine then. I did expect something like this. Time for Plan B. Interlinking... You've been blessed with quite the talent. You feel special?"</p>
<p>Noah: "What now?" The others cancelled their Interlink a while ago, joining beside Noah and Mio.</p>
<p>She continued, "I do hate to burst your bubble... but I'm afraid it's not just an Ouroboros thing. O?"</p>
<p>"I'm ready when you are! Hah!"</p>
<p>"Then... shall we?" Both transformed into their Moebius form, P with several knife-shape blades that made up a wing like a bird, a ring circled around her neck, and a crest like that of a chicken. O is a buff (only its upper torso, though) Moebius, with a ring around its very thin waist.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Moebius..."</p>
<p>P: "Now, feast your eyes!" Electric sparkles consumed their body, releasing an energy burst, sending thick dust shrouding their view. After it thinned, an abhorrent creature so ugly appeared before their eyes: an inflated chest, thin legs, an inflated chest; P's horse-like neck protruded from behind O, her teeth looks more sharp. O now had a ring around his neck, stretching his head behind P, a big mouth with not-necessarily-sharp-but-very-huge teeth, and two horns like that of a bull. Ignoring its upper torso, it does have a "golden ratio" lower torso, two horn-like structure constructing a V-shape at its waist. Two whip-like structure joining to where P's shoulders supposedly were. She inherited O's muscular arm. As their heads are directly 180° to each other{{footnote: Perhaps approximately?}}, O had difficulty turning his head to see the group.</p>
<p>The group showed disgust towards the sheer ugliness of the creature, Eunie expressed it openly, "Urgh, can't unsee!"</p>
<p>P: "Don't try to curb your disgust, you dirty pleb."</p>
<p>O wanted to speak, so he pushed P to the side temporarily for his eyes to meet the group, "Hah! We'll have you know that this is the true form of Interlinking!"</p>
<p>P started her speech like a model showing off her body, "<strong>YES!!!</strong> The form in which two worlds become one. A far more refined form than this... half-assed one you've stumbled upon. Look upon us and tremble before perfection! You'll writhe in agony before we-"</p>
<p>She never finished her speech. Mio landed her feet in her face so hard, and she was so into the speech she didn't notice until the last second, that she goes rolling backwards, making several rolls, knocking out dirt, before crashing into a rock. Clouds of dirt temporarily shrouded them from the group's view.</p>
<p>"Huh... Huh... Huh... Huh... Huh..." Mio was panting with all her might. The group had never seen <em>this</em> from her, gasped with eyes and mouth wide opened, flabbergasted and frozen. O and P were sitting on the ground, trying to get their head around what had just happened.</p>
<p>Noah sounded from behind, "Mio?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Stop...</strong>"</p>
<p>P looked up at her, "Stop?"</p>
<p>Shouting at her, "<strong>Stop toying... with everyone's livessssss!!! What did they ever do to you? Why? All they wanted was their wish to be realized! You turned everything into a game! Cast them away like dolls! These are our lives here! They're not some toys you can just play with!</strong>"</p>
<p>As the rain poured, Sena was first to recovered from her surprising action, seconded her anger, remarked with a seething tone, "Mimi's right! I've got no idea who you truly are. <em>Though I hate to admit it</em>. However, I do know one thing!" She summoned her blades and continued, "You guys really make my sparks fly!" Then, she punched the floor with her hammer.</p>
<p>Eunie took steps next, "You there, in the back. Feeling lonely 'cause you haven't been punched yet?" Summoning her blades and continuing, "You better enjoy that while it lasts, 'cause I'm about to rearrange both your mugs!" She then pointed her rifle at them.</p>
<p>Taion followed, "Usually, I'm not one for outward displays of emotion." His Mondo gauntlet appeared, Mondo swirled around him as he raised them on top of him, "<strong>But not today!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz slammed his broadsword into the ground, "Noah, <strong>you better not stop us!</strong>"</p>
<p>Withdrawing his blades, walking forward and stopping beside Mio, "Oh believe me, I won't. <strong>You make me laugh. Us, 'half-arsed'?</strong>" Pointing his sword at them, "Our conviction has never been stronger! <strong>And now...</strong> we will show no mercy. <strong>By Ethel and Cammuravi's lives, I swear... I'll make you pay!</strong>"</p>
<p>P felt insulted, "Huh! You Ouroboros brats!" Jumping high into the air and landing as a quadrupeds, with O head down and P behind the spines, "Come on then! This time, you shall tremble before our perfection!" Standing up, P swapped her direction with O, facing the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>The beeping sound similar to Ouroboros overheating could be heard; Sena's, Mio's, and Eunie's Ouroboros teamed up against him and her, but their body didn't glow yellow-orange, seemingly not them overheating.</p>
<p>Both couldn't believed their eyes, "...How could this be...? Our offense and defense... They were perfect!"</p>
<p>"Aaaaaaaaargh!" Sena's hammer broke their shield, slamming O in his face. As he looked up, we could see the Moebius ring glowing red hot, steam emanates from it.</p>
<p>O was still brain-locked, "How did they? H-how could they?! How are they so strong?! That damn noise! Shut UP with your infernal beeping!" O goes quadruped again to regain balance.</p>
<p>P: "Don't go telling us our time is up now! We were only just getting to the best part! I'll take these half-brains, and throttle the life out of 'em! I can still..." Their Moebius core started to glow red hot too, but she didn't care. Seemingly made her choice, the core released a burst of energy, itself changed to glow purple, "I can still do this! Nothing for it. Go for full Interlink! O!"</p>
<p>The group watched O and P gathering energy by their core, and two energy balls held atop their palm, "Aaaargggggghhhh!!!"</p>
<p>P: "Better brace yourself. 'Cause you're gonna have a hard time... stopping this!" Tired of her speech, Mio kicked her in her face again! She rolled backwards again, and their full Interlink process was cut short therefore.</p>
<p>As the dust thinned, we saw them all fours on the ground, catching their breath, steam dissipates from their whole body, "You're Ouroboros... Nobodies... You are nothing... to Moebius...!" She didn't give up, gathering more electrical sparkles that shrouded their body surface, releasing thick purple cloud/fog and shockwave that the Ouroboros had to shield their face against.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Oi, oi! Things are lookin' pretty snuffed up!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Noah, something's strange!"</p>
<p>"Iaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!" Every step their feet put forward, purple flames the color of black fog burned a hole in the ground. P: "Y-you'll never... get away with this! Neveeeeerrrrr!!! Ne... ne... ne...?" The core has reached its limit, emitting a burst of energy shockwave to release the pressure.</p>
<p>A few moments later, dust started to blow in the opposite direction, towards O and P. Confused, P looked at their body, "Wh- what's this light?! What's happening?! Wh-why can't we move?!"</p>
<p>Taion: "The black fog?!" It's not just dust being absorbed, but black fog were aggregating with them as the center of absorption. He was reminded of the damage an annihilation cast when they visited the desert, "No... the annihilation effect?!"</p>
<p>Noah: "What? Are you sure?!"</p>
<p>"Noah! We have to get away from them! <strong>We have to retreat!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>We're not gonna make it...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz took control, "<strong>OH, SHIT!!!</strong>" He raised a ring shield; the best he could do in this situation. Taion also did the same, taking control and raised a Mondo shield.</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh... <strong>Mio!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'm on it!" Mio's Ouroboros sprinted towards O and P.</p>
<p>"Huh? Mio! What are you?"{{footnote: Is this from Lanz or from Taion?}}</p>
<p>Just before they arrived, she jumped mid-air, cancelled the Interlink, and Noah unsheathed Lucky Seven while they slowly floated upwards{{footnote: while their force were still larger than gravity acting on them.}.</p>
<p>"This is it!" He held out the handle for Mio to grab.</p>
<p>"It's the only... way!!!" One of her hand on the tip of the handle, Noah covered her hand with his. Aiming at the ground, "Hahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!" They stuck Lucky Seven into the ground in front of O and P, cracking the floor open, releasing lots of dust and debris. The ground O and P stood on cracked into two, and they went falling downwards.</p>
<p>While P watched in agony, the two quickly turned around and sprinted for their lives, lest they get themselves falling down, lest they cannot get out of the annihilation bubble on time. "Waaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" O and P screamed as they dropped.</p>
<p>A few moments later, a bright green light blinded the vicinity. Noah hugged her as they fall onto the ground. Taion's and Lanz's get in front of them, raised the shield just in time for the shockwave. "Urgggggggghhhhhhh!!!!" The annihilation lasted for a few seconds, leaving some engravings on the rocky pillars, signifying it had been here before. Remnants of rocks swirled around where the annihilation event disappeared, as usual.</p>
<p>Sensing the disappearance of the intense winds and dusts, the two slowly got back up on their feet, while the other four cancelled their Interlink. Noah, scanning the horizon, asked, "Is it over...?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Are we... all in one piece?"</p>
<p>Lanz, scratching his head, "Yeah... Think I've got all my limbs attached."</p>
<p>Eunie was coughing furiously, "Queen's fingers, that was close!"</p>
<p>Taion was impressed, "Quite a snap decision there, Noah!"</p>
<p>He calmly replied, turning towards her, "That was Mio's doing. I'm very impressed!"</p>
<p>"It was easy. I do know how you think."</p>
<p>She felt complimented, but not cheered up. She turned and walked towards the Ferronises, the group followed behind. Both brought out their flutes, reminisced for a moment, then played their melody.{{footnote: The first time they played with swapped flutes, eh...}}</p>
<p>Blue moats rose from within the command center, from the remains of their shirt, dissipating as it rose into the air. The others reminisced the scene in silence. Mio shed a tear while she was playing the melody. They could finally rest in peace.</p>
<hr />
<p>That night, gathering around a bonfire, camping beside a rocky wall. Riku and Manana were fully asleep. The others just sat around, as Lanz started the conversation, "Noah. Can I ask a weird question?"</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"In that ceremony... You didn't send... 'them' off?"</p>
<p>His raised his eyebrows, "No, today's been a bit much. I'm only human."</p>
<p>"I know, right? Well then. That's a relief."</p>
<p>Mio remarked, "It's wrong. That shouldn't be what gives our lives purpose. Wasn't there a different way? A better one?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Those two... fought for their ideal..." Looking up as if they turned into stars, watching down at them{{footnote: Though we couldn't see any stars...}}, "Something more important than their lives."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Honor? Or pride?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Satisfaction, perhaps?" Then immediately rejected himself, shaking his head, "No, that's wrong... Something we can't put into words."</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah, but what? Can it really be that important?"</p>
<p>"I can't say..."</p>
<p>Sena asked, "Do you think they found it? That... 'something'?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Be nice if they did."</p>
<p>Noah: "You think so?" They turned to him, whom was looking on the ground, "I just... Seems... so sad."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio felt the stone in his heart. Together, they watched sparks rose from the bonfire, dissipating its little light as it floated upwards, before their flames died.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning. Seemingly a (short) valley, with rocks to the left and right, the left far taller than the right. On the right platform, we saw the old buildings placed on it, together with some trees behind.</p>
<p>Lanz, Eunie, Sena, and Taion were gathering around, chatting. Riku tried to wake Manana up. Mio took steps towards Noah, whom was practicing his sword some distance away. To the distance, a building resting slanted to the horizontal, its beams so strong it didn't break{{footnote: Does cement building breaks if we slanted them 75° to the vertical?}} Below the building laid the Ferronises.</p>
<p>Finishing his moves and sheathing his blades, he turned to the footsteps behind, asked, "Sleep well?"</p>
<p>"Yeah... Well, sort of."</p>
<p>"Well... Your eyes are red."</p>
<p>"Hey, shut up... So what if they are?" She step forward and poke him on his forehead, turned away while he covered where she poked. "But... I know what I have to do." Turning back to him, "Everything's so... clear now."</p>
<p>"Same here."</p>
<p>"We'd better hurry. After all... the threat's not gone."</p>
<p>"Yeah. That's true. <em>Heh...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>In an uplifting tone, "You surprised me." Then, he showed it by punching himself in his cheek.{{footnote: Perhaps that's her foot at P's face he meant?}} She could only scratched her head.</p>
<p>She replied, "You did too. I... I didn't think you were the sort to take such a stand."</p>
<p>"Sometimes, we're left with no other choice."</p>
<p>She thought for a while what he meant before agreeing, "Mmm... Yeah! I think you're right! Absolutely right." Then, she turned to look at the Ferronises. He followed her glance, before she asked, "What do we do about... Ethel?"</p>
<p>"When things are settled, we'll let Colony 4 know. It's what she'd want. I'm certain of it."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're right. She'd be... happy." As she finished, they turned and walk towards the group, where they camped. The others had finished chatting, awaiting their return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> The surrounding below the annihilator stuffed with hovering islands, the latter paved with thin layer of grass, but mostly dirt. Wind-eroded rocks decorated the place. Bunnits and raptors{{footnote: Crocodiles?}} roamed the island. A stronghold stood still, connecting to the castle via bridges. Laia{{footnote: Flying stingrays}} roamed the clouds. A sacrificial altar structure at one of the small island we took note. This, is <strong>Syra Hovering Reefs</strong>, of Keves Castle Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>As the group entered the hovering reefs, Eunie conversing with Lanz, Mio with Noah, Riku with Manana, with Taion and Sena dropped last. Taion was looking at Mio, unbeknownst to her, perhaps thinking about the time she had left, or her legacy, when Sena started a conversation, "I wonder... How do you think Ethel felt? Was that really what she wanted?"</p>
<p>"This is my personal opinion, but... <strong><em>Life's defined by moments. Your acts define you.</em></strong>{{footnote: WOW! Well said!}} I think she found value in that! To achieve something in the limited time left to her, <em>one</em> defining moment was what she chose."</p>
<p>She then looked at Mio, "You think Mimi... feels the same way?"</p>
<p>"I gave you my opinion. I'm sure Mio has her own thoughts on the matter." Then, looking down and feeling down, "Although, I know she doesn't have that much time left." But he gathered his will together, "<em>And hence</em>, my being here now."</p>
<p>"So... you've chosen your path."</p>
<p>In a quieter tone, "Until now I was afraid to take that first step. But now... I can do it."</p>
<p>"Man."</p>
<hr />
<p>In a room, N, Joran (J), and the cow moebius (D) gathered together, looking outside the Castle's window, Joran asking, "You really think they'll come?"</p>
<p>N: "They'll come. You can count on it."</p>
<p>D: "Yeah? And then what? If you wanna give 'em a hug, you can count me out of it."</p>
<p>"I wanted to show something to 'Her Majesty'."</p>
<p>"Yeah? And what's that, then? I mean, she's not even-..."</p>
<p>"She needs to be there to see how hope <em>dies</em>."</p>
<p>Joran: "What's this about now?"</p>
<p>N: "She <em>can</em> see it." He turned to his back, and the other two followed glance. The Queen stood in front of her throne. N continued, "'Her Majesty' occupies the same niche of existence as we do." Then, his Moebius Iris shone, D looked at him, trying to figure out any unspoken info.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group stopped overlooking the stronghold entrance. No soldiers were garrisoning the entrance. Noah told the group, "Just past that gate, we'll find the Colony 11 garrison." An array of floating buildings, supported by floating islands, connecting towards the castle via bridges in an L shape, until it reaches the Castle's entrance. He continued, "Beyond hat is a residential zone. From there, there's a road to the Castle's main gate."</p>
<p>Riku shook his head, "Gate penetration would not be easy. Expect huge battle."</p>
<p>"Yeah. So we'll take a detour through the hovering reefs to the right and swing around behind the Castle. That's where we'll find the ether mine and freight entrance I mentioned." The islands were connected by ropes.</p>
<p>Taion: "Understood. We shouldn't be hanging around here for long. Let's make for those 'reefs', as you called them."</p>
<p>"Good. <strong>This way. Follow me.</strong>" The group make their way towards the rope.</p>
<hr />
<p>The final island connecting to the freight entrance were heavy with black fog, and ether particles evaporated from the ground here and there. Taion remarked, "There it is." Several levnises and soldiers gathered around the area.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Black fog, too. Few enough numbers to sneak around."</p>
<p>Sena was worried, turning to Mio, "Is Colony 4 gonna be safe, do you think?"</p>
<p>"They should be OK. We haven't seen the light for a while. I think that's a good sign."</p>
<p>Taion urged, "Let's move. The fact that we killed Consuls must be old news at this point. Could have made examples of a few people by now."</p>
<p>Eunie rebutted, folding her arms, "They ain't expecting us to sneak aboard, though. We've got 'em with their pants down. Let's get in there, mess 'em up, get out, bish bash bosh."</p>
<p>Noah wasn't so optimistic, "Actually... They may have already... anticipated our moves."</p>
<p>Lanz couldn't believe his ears, "Nah, mate. Come off it."</p>
<p>"Think about it... How would they have known where we'd be?"</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"Can't be a coincidence. I mean, sure, it could have been intuition on Ethel's part, but we have to be realistic."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So it's a trap? You wanna turn back?"</p>
<p>"No... we'll go. We can't turn back now. We can't allow their deaths to have been in vain."</p>
<p>Taion: "So you would entertain the risk?"</p>
<p>"It does sound bad."</p>
<p>Pushing his glasses up, "You know, I think I kind of like it." OK, that doesn't sound like him. Noah iris widened.</p>
<p>From behind a rock further behind them, the girl that took Guernica's eyepatch watched the group, unbeknownst to them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Moving closer to their target, a bunch of levnises guarding the area, looking in several directions. One person talking to a Levnis about the chests, or maybe speaking over his Iris. Rows of Levnises parked within the Castle; one transporting levnis is zooming slowly on the air. Just one more bridges{{footnote: This is not man-made bridge, but natural bridge.}} and they'll reach where they wanted to, the containers. And another slope to reach a platform connecting to the freight entrance via a man-made bridge.</p>
<p>Sena commented, "Looks like you were right, Noah. There's a whole bunch of containers here." Lanz nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Manana: "A welcome gift for easy sneakings!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Let's go over this again. First, we get to those containers without being spotted. With me so far?" There were more containers to the right of the chest we spoke of earlier.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Anyone spots us, we're like ninjas. We take 'em out quickly and silently." He nodded in return.</p>
<p>Touching his Iris to pass data to the group, the Castle map popped up as he continued, "Once we're inside, we pick the right opportunity to proceed through the hangar. Our goal... is here." It's somewhere behind the Annihilator.</p>
<p>Mio: "The maintenance hatch, that leads outside."</p>
<p>Riku: "From there we head to outer deck."</p>
<p>Noah: "Right." Zooming in, that's a place we have seen before, a platform with no routes forward. Focusing on the area below, where the rings are located, "Enemy presence should be lower around there. Then we move to the main housing."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Assuming we get there, how do we trash it?"</p>
<p>Taion took over, "I can brief you on the next steps." Noah agreed with him.</p>
<p>"After analyzing the data we got from Borealis, I discovered a flaw in the Annihilator's construction."</p>
<p>"A weak point?" He and Manana were holding their gadget, since they don't have Irises.</p>
<p>"Indeed. Here. The weapon is designed to temporarily render the black fog inactive, condense, and collect it, then release it in one blast." A green line drawn from the top of the castle showing the Black Fog flow, into a container at the bottom, probably the condenser and storage unit, before passing it to the Annihilator located at the same height as the container.</p>
<p>He continued, "Our best bet is to destroy the neutralizer assembly from which it draws its power, but it's located in the Castle interior. Getting there will be no joke." He was referring to the container. "Once there, we'll need to damage the auto-balancer in the barrel's housing." This was the 'grip' that connects the Annihilator to the ring.</p>
<p>Highlighting the ring, "Most likely it was built in a hurry. The movable barrel is affixed to this outer ring that you see here. But the ring isn't strong enough to take the barrel's weight or absorb the recoil. That's why the auto-balancer was added after construction, as an afterthought."</p>
<p>Eunie can't sync with the high-tech info given to her, "So what, we've just gotta smash that thing to pieces?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Smash it and the entire ring begins to fall apart, <strong>and</strong> the barrel collapses under its own weight. "</p>
<p>Mio had a question, "How strong is the auto-balancer? Not too sturdy?"</p>
<p>"Nothing Ouroboros can't handle."</p>
<p>Eunie highlighted another stuff above the ring. The auto-balancer was behind the ring. "So, what's this thing?"</p>
<p>Taion explained, "<strong>That</strong>, is a refrigeration unit -- the barrel needs vast amounts of energy. It would have to be kept cool at all times, to keep the energy in check."</p>
<p>"I'm surprised it's so <strong>huge</strong>."</p>
<p>"Seems that was built quickly too. It's got both bulk and heft to it. They probably couldn't have made it any smaller."</p>
<p>"Hmm. A rush job, huh."</p>
<p>Lanz first deactivated his iris before others followed, "OK then. We all good to go?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah. No more taking it easy. Let's make this happen."</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah, popping his head from behind a container, overheard a soldier back-facing them spoke to his/her iris, "Hurry up and load the stuff going to Colony 5 into the transport." Then, (s)he turned to another soldier from behind him/her, in Noah's direction, nudged, "And that stuff is going to the Castle."</p>
<p>He already hid his body before the soldier turned, "Hear that? They're going to the Castle."</p>
<p>Taion: "Let's hide in that container."</p>
<p>The group swiftly and quietly moved behind and between containers, checking that soldiers weren't looking in their direction. They then heard a Keves soldier signaled into his/her iris, "OK, start loading." Several 6-legged transporting levnis entered the Castle.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Lots of levnis inside the castle patrolling the factory-looking interior.  Unfortunately, it was hard to describe the scenery, except for bridges and machinery; nothing natural, nothing worth describing. This, is <strong>Keves Castle</strong>, in Keves Castle Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group quietly sneaked past patrolling/stationed soldiers and levnises, via small path in between containers or other formations. Arriving at a joint, the group stopped, watching all directions, waiting for levnises to pass as Taion checked the map. Sena turned to him and asked, "So, where's the maintenance hatch?"</p>
<p>"It's in the reserve area on the upper level. First, we'll need to take the elevator that can get us up to that floor." The group looked in the distance where there were slanted elevators like the ones in the shopping mall (not lift but elevators).</p>
<p>Eunie scanned their routes: "I don't see any guards."</p>
<p>"Too foggy, for taste of Manana."</p>
<p>Lanz cut their discussion short, "If we're gonna move, now's the time."</p>
<p>Noah gave final caution, "That said, we are indoors. Move fast, but keep your eyes peeled."</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah, of course." The others nodded and continued their journey.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Riku see! There is Annihilator!" The group exit the final door they needed to past, and now located behind the Annihilator.</p>
<p>"Bigger than Homecoming pudding!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "That's huge. Think of the firepower... Two or three colonies could, like, be wiped off the map with one shot of that."</p>
<p>Mio turned to Noah, "We have to hurry! If it starts moving now..." To which he nodded back.</p>
<p>"If the map is correct, the auto-balancer should be in that housing." They look at a bunker-like door placed behind the Annihilator, below the refrigeration unit. It seems like it's a building that you can enter.</p>
<p>Sena: "That's what we're after, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" Then, the group dashed towards their target.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group walked towards the auto-balancer on a bridge that connected the latter to the castle. Stopping, Noah commented, "It looks even bigger, seeing it up close..."</p>
<p>Taion looked up, signaled, "Noah. That's the auto-balancer."</p>
<p>"Right. Just like on the map."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Well then, let's get to it. Sena!"</p>
<p>"My pleasure!"</p>
<p>He took one step forward; suddenly, he felt an alarm in his unconscious, backed up just before a glowing fingernail punched into the ground before him. "Ukkk...." "Huhhhh..." As the group was brainfrozen, the fingernail exploded, sending dust and sparks, forcing the group turning their head sideways and closing their eyes. Looking to the source, a moebius, in its monster form, moving his sharp teeth, "Sorry pals, 'fraid I can't let you do that."</p>
<p>Noah: "You?!"</p>
<p>"'Sup? Been a while, eh?" It's the moebius from Eunie's past lives! The last time he appeared, he destroyed the Golden Flame Clock.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Moebius... How'd you figure it out?"</p>
<p>"You lot aren't too bright, are you? Sure, we can't pinpoint your exact position inside all the black fog, but we can get a general idea where you're hanging out. Once we picked up your reading near the Castle, we knew. I mean, what, you were just passing through, were you? You'd have to be an idiot to think that."</p>
<p>"<strong>Grrr!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie's eyes turned shaky, after so long, they finally reunited! With gritty teeth, she couldn't stop her past fears from taking over her attention.</p>
<p>Noticing her abnormality, Taion prompted and brought back her attention,  "Eunie? What is it?"</p>
<p>She turned to look at him, "It's... Nothing." Then looking back at the moebius, "This guy just does my head in, is all."</p>
<p>Manana: "He very condescending."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>I couldn't agree more. Let's shut him up then.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Heheheheheheheh....."</p>
<p>"Pffft!"</p>
<p>The moebius teleported to the bridge they were standing from above the auto balancer. They exit their moebius formed; it was an Interlink between D and J.</p>
<p>"Huhuh!"</p>
<p>Lanz was shocked, "Joran... You're here too..."</p>
<p>Putting his hands behind his head, "Ahahahahah..."</p>
<p>D put his hands to his back, found the button, and remove his helmet, and revealed his face. Yellow-brownish hair, some shaved moustache, tanned skin, crimson iris, and thick eyebrow. He had an earring on his right ear, not his left. Not very special. Though, the feathers around his shoulders really stretches from his jacket!</p>
<p>Noah: "So that's what you look like..."</p>
<p>He replied, "Whadda ya think? Quite the looker, eh?"</p>
<p>Sena: "I knew it was a trap!"</p>
<p>Joran: "I'm not entirely sure I would say 'trap' exactly. Eh, you'd have to ask N for the details."</p>
<p>Noah: "N?"</p>
<p>D: "So you took down P and O, didja? Not bad at all!"</p>
<p>Joran: "Good riddance, I say. Idiots. I mean, going past the time limit while Interlinking? Who does that? <em>Dumbest thing I've ever heard!</em>" He laughed as he shook his head.</p>
<p>Taion now had the confirmation, "So that really was it. The time limit."</p>
<p>D: "Well, since you lot have already tangled with them, we can make this quick. I'm just glad I won't have to explain this." As he was finishing his sentence, purple hue lights up his body and he transformed to his moebius form.</p>
<p>Joran: "Yes. Why even explain?" He too. Electric sparkles around for a moment before they instantaneously interlinked.</p>
<p>Taion noted, "How typical."</p>
<p>"So? Loads better than P and O, right? Hehehe!"</p>
<p>Riku: "Can beat them this time?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Won't know until we try!"</p>
<p>Sena couldn't believe his words, "Well, what are we gonna try?! <strong>Joran's in there, you know</strong>?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, I noticed!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie couldn't make up her decision, "N-Noah?!"</p>
<p>He nodded, calmly, "No time to think!" Withdrawing their blades, he shouted, "For Ethel's sake... <strong>We have to destroy the Annihilator</strong>!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Compressed and/or condensed black fog moving along the cyan tube inside the ring; "<strong>Annihilator has started moving!</strong>" Manana screamed.</p>
<p>Riku seconded, "This is bad, Noah!"</p>
<p>"I see it!" He and Mio was running, interlinked as he replied. D and J intersected them from reaching the auto balancer. Sena and Lanz, interlinked as Noah's Ouroboros started exchanging blows with the moebius, joined in.</p>
<p>"No you don't!" The moebius threw Noah's Ouroboros in the opposite direction, then landed a punch on Lanz's Ouroboros's chest. "Hyaaaa!" As he flew backwards, Noah's Ouroboros jumped from behind, to which he blocked his slash, and Mio took control.</p>
<p>"Whatcha slackin' around for? If you don't hurry... the Colony's gonna be a pile of ash!" His fingernails easily cut off one of her limbs. She did some somersault, landing a hit with the rings on her legs, to no avail. He easily caught hold of her legs and threw her into a distance. "Haaaaa!" "Urrrgaaaaaaa!!!!"</p>
<p>Eunie's Ouroboros didn't join in the fight. Taion was desperately calling out for her attention, "Eunie! What are you doing?!" The Moebius turned his attention to her, plus Taion's prompts, she took steps back,</p>
<p>"Urgggggghhhh!!!!" That brought her back from daydreaming. She jumped into the air and randomly fire bullets around D and J; her accuracy was... so bad that none hit him. Before long, dust enshrouded her vision, best way for the moebius to hide.</p>
<p>Mio, still on the floor, managed to grow her limb back as she warned, "Behind you, Eunie!"</p>
<p>"Huh!?" She turned and saw him an elbow distance away from her. "Urg huh!" He grabbed her head with his huge palm. She put two of her limbs on his hand, trying to push it away, kicking her legs like an insect with its abdomen inside a lizard's mouth trying to crawl out of its mouth with its front limbs.{{footnote: Sorry, because this is a real event one observed some time ago, one only can remember this right now.}}</p>
<p>"Haaaaaa!" He threw her straight towards the wall below auto-balancer, "Wuaaaaa!!!!" As she flew backwards, he fired more shots at her. As the dust dissipated, herself stuck on the wall for a moment before gravity took over and crashed to the ground.</p>
<p>Taion: "What's the matter, Eunie?! You're too slow!" While she struggled to stand on her feet, D and J landed on the ground; Mio also just got up on her feet behind the background.</p>
<p>D smilingly exclaimed, "Girly! I think we've met before."</p>
<p>Eunie, her voice trembling, "Wh-what?"</p>
<p>"Heh heh heh... Those eyes! You're afraid, aren't you? Why so scared? Heh heh heh! I'll kill you whenever you cross my path!"</p>
<p>"Uh huh!" She gasped of fear.</p>
<p>Taion had had enough, seeing that she can't control her emotions. "Let me lead! I'll handle this! Go! Mondo!" A few groups of Mondo approached from several directions.</p>
<p>"You're not hittin' me!" He dodged the flying cards with agile.</p>
<p>"Hah! Sure about that?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Bind!" It created a ring around D and J. "Scatter!" They Mondo concentrated on the moebius and exploded.</p>
<p>Sena: "We won?"</p>
<p>Noah peered closely, "No..."</p>
<p>The Moebius appeared with a green hue on its body surface, jumped on Taion's Ouroboros before he could make it out, and grabbed him by his neck, "What?!" Slamming him on the wall, "Gaaaaaaa!!!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Joran..."</p>
<p>Joran: "Sorry, I don't think so. You'll have to do something about me first. You'll never win this otherwise. Heh heh heh!" Taion's Ouroboros fell on the floor as the Moebius landed in front of him.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Urg... Well then... We'll just have to take out <strong>this</strong>!" Sena took over and landing a hammer towards the auto balancer.</p>
<p>Sena: "Mimi! You gotta keep them busy!"</p>
<p>"I'll do that!" She launched herself to the Moebius simultaneously.</p>
<p>Beams shot from below the refrigeration unit in a forward conical shape randomly manage to slice Sena's Ouroboros into 5 different parts, all her limbs separated from her torso{{footnote: Or 6 parts, if you count the hammer as another, detached from her limbs.}}. "Ahhhhh!" Both of them crashed on the ground, smoke rose from their broken limbs.</p>
<p>D: "What, you thought this was just a fashion choice?" He was pointing to the crystal horn on his head, "These can sense the slightest shifts in the air. Kind of a sensor, really. Even without looking at you, I can tell exactly what you're doing, so you brats better learn fast!" He picked up Taion's Ouroboros by his neck, whom still haven't recovered from the last smash, then threw him to join the other two. On the first contact with ground, Eunie took back control.</p>
<p>The Annihilator continued growing the ball of energy at its tip. The Moebius signaled with his index finger, as if saying, 'come, come!' Eunie was trembling as she tried to stand up; Noah and Lanz took control in the meantime, dashing towards the Moebius. They were out of time. The Annihilator was about to fire.</p>
<p>Taion saw the dire situation, shouted, "<strong>The Annihilator!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urghuh..." Doing 'pushups', she still couldn't get up. her limbs effete, panting of fear.</p>
<p>Watching the battle, the Moebius sliced off Noah's Ouroboros arm with his fingernail, and threw them in opposite direction before turning to Lanz. Taion desperately called out, "Eunie, what are you-?! Move! If you won't move, let me-"</p>
<p>"Taion..." She called out effetely, stop him from continued speaking. She had to get over this herself; or she will live in fear for the rest of her life. She must!</p>
<p>"Huh!" His eyes widened as he attended to her.</p>
<p>"Yaaaaaaa!!!!" Lanz was beaten back, rolled along the bridge before landing somewhere in front of Riku and Manana; the two quickly dodged back to avoid being hit.</p>
<p>Eunie was still panting furiously, turning to the Moebius, whom was smiling at her. "<strong>Urgaaaaaaaaaaa</strong>!!!!" Screaming out loud, she mustered enough energy to stand on her feet, launched herself at him, and waved her rifle as if it was a melee weapon; the moves so random and slow{{footnote: Like you swing a stick, if you swing it too hard, it'll 'smash', but you had a hard time changing direction.}} that the moebius had no trouble dodging it.</p>
<p>He found a chance to grab her rifle and tucked it under his armpit; which she tried hard to pull it out to no avail. He had time to tease her, "Getting desperate?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie!"</p>
<p>"Heheheheh..." He slowly pushed her fingernails closer and closer to her eyes, like how he did in her past memories, which she slowly backed away from, as he continued, "Or maybe you've realized that the end is nigh."</p>
<p>Just before it touched her head, she screamed once more, "<strong>Urgaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!</strong>" And blasted the rifle, tilted it to aim at the auto balancer, and burst it into flames. Turning the rifle's angle with the moebius's armpit as a pivot isn't as difficult as it seems.</p>
<p>"Urg..." Now that he realized, it was a bit too late. Even though he raised the rifle so it pointed downwards, raising Eunie's Ouroboros with it, the damage was done. She sheated her rifle before blasting some random shots at him, to which he dodged. Another rifle beam blasted his way, and he still dodged, perhaps aware that it does sliced some of the walls below the auto balancer. Flying towards him, she shots many card-like bullets at him, one of it pierced into his moebius core. He swiftly dodged it, yet the cards stuck to the bottom of the auto balancer. Not yet done. The Annihilator was still holding.</p>
<p>Catching her by her neck, he reminded, "I thought I told you, I can read your every movement in the air!"</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth, "Hah!"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>By now, she regained her equanimity, "All you're sensing... is the area around you."</p>
<p>"What's your point?"</p>
<p>"Well, if I make some distance, looks like you can sense... spark all!" She disappeared from his grip, and Taion took over and teleported behind him.</p>
<p>"An illusion?" Mondo cards slowly rose from around them, as Taion didn't forget to 'push up his glasses' even in his Ouroboros's form, and without a glasses to push.</p>
<p>"Just so!" Snapping his fingers, the paper card previously shot as bullets turned into Mondos.  Before the moebius could react, "<strong>SCATTER!!!</strong>" A bright explosion tipped the Annihilator's balance off the ring.</p>
<p>"Son of a-... You did that at the start?!" He knew he couldn't stop the damage; he tried to grab Taion's Ouroboros by his neck, but Eunie took control and somehow manage to pin him down on the floor by his limbs; he couldn't get out of her lock, as she commented,</p>
<p>"Heh... Thought you had my number? You were so into my fear that you didn't notice what changed! And sure, I was scared. But even then... You'll find I'm no quitter!"</p>
<p>As the explosion continued, "Aaaaaaaaaa!!!" He tried harder and harder, to no avail he could raised his limbs from the piercing pins. That wasn't the end; like a lizard willingly detaching its tails, he detached both his limbs and crawled backwards, 'lives' escaping from the wounds.</p>
<p>"You ain't escapin'!" The 'pins' were the 'flaps' that floated behind Eunie's Ouroboros. She redirected the pins and pinned him down again on his shoulder, before landing a leg on his face.{{footnote: How come suddenly so weak?}} He looked at him side-faced.</p>
<p>Taion counted the time while she vent, called out when the situation became dire, "<strong>Eunie</strong>!"</p>
<p>She gritted her teeth for a moment, before pulling out her 'flaps' and jumping backwards. Just then, the Annihilator, tilting downwards with the huge ball of energy; the ball dissipated, the ring bent downwards. We could see Eunie jumping away before the ring started breaking.</p>
<p>D shouted, "<strong>J! Split up now!</strong>"</p>
<p>He nodded, noting their dire situation, "Mmm. Got it." The black fog became unstable inside the annihilator; it did not create an annihilation, but a bright ball of flames engulfed the surrounding area, including part of the ring and a portion of the castle, dealing damage not much weaker from a real annihilation event. The group raised shields{{footnote: All 3 shields are the ones we see from Lanz's Ouroboros, unsure how.}} against such searing flames.</p>
<p>As the blinding light dimmed, Lanz and Sena, now cancelled their Interlink, peered down from over the edge, Lanz asking, "Are they dead?"</p>
<p>The others took step behind them, and Taion had an answer, "No... I shot one of my Mondo into their body. I sense it's still there." It was the one that sliced itself at the moebius core just now. "I'd say it's likely they got away."</p>
<p>"That right...?"</p>
<p>Eunie was looking down with muddied feelings. Taion now had time to turn to her, "Eunie... Have you ever met him before? As in before we became Ouroboros, I mean."</p>
<p>"No idea... But I think that... something inside me remembers." Her hand trembled as she clenched it in front of her chest, "That guy... and his claws{{footnote: What she called 'claws' is what Translator meant by 'fingernails'.}}..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Maybe that has to do with Moebius too. Why they exist here in our world."</p>
<p>In a shaking voice, "Well then... I've gotta know, don't I? And then, I'll break free... And it won't have to feel like I'm suffocating..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Eunie..."</p>
<p>Noah: "We can think more later. Right now, we should make ourselves scarce."</p>
<p>Mio seconded, "You're right. We might have destroyed the Annihilator, but we haven't liberated the Castle." They turned to look at the Castle behind them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the castle; on a platform beside gushing waters, the group emerged from the water, unable to continue with a turbine blocking the way, certainly would slice them into pieces if they tried. Lanz exclaimed: "Great. We can't go on with this thing in the way!"</p>
<p>Riku suggested, "Maybe this channel... not connect to outside Castle?"</p>
<p>Noah, checking the map once more time, "Weird... This wasn't on the map."{{footnote: Just how so people don't question the paradigm but question themselves, unless a major paradigm shift is on the way, like questioning whether the sun revolves around the Earth was met with resistance. We might ask, how could they not thought they were given the wrong map on purpose, how could Ethel got her hands on the map if the Moebius don't allow it, but that's hindsight bias. We're probably equally stupid in their shoes if we don't have stay vigilant, questioning the paradigm.}}</p>
<p>Eunie: "So where are we at, right now?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere here in the mid-level?" Looking upwards, "It's OK. If we go a bit further, we can get back in the channel." There was some rings moving upwards around a pole, which they could ride to get up.</p>
<p>Sena: "Might as well, then. Let's see where this goes."</p>
<p>"Yeah." They proceed to rode the 'lift' (moving rings).</p>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived on ankle-high waters, inside the Queen's chamber. Feeling weird, Mio stopped and turned to Noah, asked, "Um... are you sure we're on the right path? Doesn't this feel off?"</p>
<p>"We followed the right route..." Checking the data on his iris again, "According to Bolearis's data, we should be..."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Riku and Manana were glancing at the surrounding, with the latter remarked in an upbeat tone, "Everything here look so sumptuous and lavish!"</p>
<p>Noah felt off, "Wait..."</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>Looking at the surrounding, "It's the right path, but... <strong>We shouldn't be here!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "What didja mean? Why shouldn't we?" He ignored her questions and dashed out to the central long path, to confirm his hypothesis. the group followed behind thereafter, revealing themselves from their 'hiding place'. We could see the lift to his left, yet he turned to his right.</p>
<p>"Huh... <strong>I should have known!</strong>"</p>
<p>As the group joined in, Eunie commented, "Th-this place. I saw an image of it in training."</p>
<p>Lanz sensed the danger, "Oh. Oh... <strong>Shit, we gotta go!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion was confused, "Noah, is this where I think it is?"</p>
<p>Effetely, "Yeah. The throne room!"</p>
<p>Riku and Manana were shocked, the former commented, "This not just bad place. This worstest place, heart of enemy base!"</p>
<p>Taion quietly and calmly spoke, as if to prevent catching attention, "We haven't been noticed, yet. Let's get out of here, now!"</p>
<p>"Good idea."  The group quickly dashed to the opposite direction, where they predicted would be the continuation of where the stream would lead. Noah ran with the team for a while, but his unconscious seemed to completely processed something and brought forth to his conscious mind. He stopped as the group dashed past him, gazing at the throne room.</p>
<p>Mio saw him daydreaming, quietly and nervously urged, "What are you doing?! We have to go!"</p>
<p>He betrayed their decisions, ran towards the throne room himself. Already downstairs, feet in the water, Lanz and Eunie was waiting for him, the latter saw him dashing off so she shouted to him, "<strong>Noah, what're you playin' at?! Come on!</strong>" Seeing that Mio unconditionally ran after him, they couldn't just leave themselves, so they (including Taion and the others) followed.</p>
<p>Arriving at the throne room, he looked around and saw the array of pods where they were born. He gasped as he was dumbstruck at the scenery around him. Mio approached beside him, asking for confirmation, "Is this...?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. I barely remember it... but yeah...{{footnote: Your eyes weren't yet open, still an embryo, but how could you remember it. That's something weird.}} This is the place... where we were born..." Humanoid blurry shadows lurked behind the orange tinted glasses, with bubbles floating often.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Spark... This is creepy. Were we... ever like that?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "My skin's crawlin'... <em>Please can we leave</em>?"</p>
<p>Sena: "All those people... Do you think they're sleeping? Or maybe they're..."</p>
<p>One of the pod caught Noah's attention, "Wait, is that... It <strong>is</strong> her." Confirmed with his own hypothesis, he dashed off to it.</p>
<p>"What?" Mio was confused at his action.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ethel!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Stopping behind him, they saw Ethel in her child form inside one of the pod.</p>
<p>Taion was shocked, "That's crazy! How can it be Ethel?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Well, it sure looks like her... but this is definitely a first-termer!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "No. It really is Ethel. From when we first met her."</p>
<p>Lanz seconded, "Yeah. No mistake."</p>
<p>Mio prompted for more, "W-What do you mean, when you first met...?"</p>
<p>That's too much for Noah to take in. In a shuddering voice, he questioned, "What in the... <strong>spark... <em>is</em> this?</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie thought it make sense, "This is what they taught us, right? That our lives are born from the Queen..."</p>
<p>Taion was shocked, "You are as well?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Same for you guys?" To which he nodded.</p>
<p>"We soldiers are born from the Queen, we fight... and then..."</p>
<p>"To the Queen you return." The Kevesi Queen's voice sounded from above, finishing his sentence. Her throne slowly floated down from above as the group watched. They ran up to face her just when her 'chair' docked into position.</p>
<p>"Th-the Queen...?"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Melia</strong>..."</p>
<p>Mio: "That's the... Queen of Keves... Melia..."</p>
<p>The Queen continued, "You have returned... My beloved... soldiers..." The group disturbingly gasped. N teleported to the Queen's 4 o'clock, entering the scene. The group was alerted into their defensive posture.</p>
<p>Noah: "A Consul?"</p>
<p>N did not hide his repugnance at the group, "Ouroboros rabble. You dare to intrude on the presence of Her Majesty, Melia Antiqua?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Sena never seen one before, "There's a Golden Consul...?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "What... is this guy?"</p>
<p>Taion: "He's not like the other Consuls we've met... Mio, be careful!" As he turned to her with his warning, her vision was locked on the golden consul. Her trembling breathe revealed her shaky mind, until Taion cut her from her thoughts, "Mio!"</p>
<p>She gasped at the sudden callout, turning to him, "Ah... sorry."</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "Uh, nothing. Don't worry. I'm OK..." Turning back to the Golden Consul, she was trying to recall inside her head, "<em>I know him... But from where...?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah tightened his iris. Focusing on him with intensity, suddenly, a throbbing uncontrollably shock emanates from his brain, making him groaned in pain, questioning, "What is... this sensation...?"</p>
<p>Thrusting her staff on the floor, the Queen continued her speech, "I have endeavored, for countless years... to protect... and shelter Keves under my aegis. And now you seek to bring ruin to this world." Shaking her head, "This grieves me."</p>
<p>Lanz couldn't believe his ears, "Come off it. How are we bringing ruin to anything?"</p>
<p>"You seek to deny it? Think. Upon your actions. Have you, or have you not... destroyed Colony Flame Clocks?"</p>
<p>Eunie rebutted, "We didn't have any choice!"</p>
<p>"No choice? Indeed. I assume then... you had no choice but to collude with our sworn enemy?"</p>
<p>Noah, recovered from his throbbing headache, "That's why you've been trying to wipe us out? <strong>Both us, and Ethel's Colony 4?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Verily it is said... Ouroboros abhor this world. You must be erased, lest this world be destroyed."</p>
<p>Eunie couldn't continued listening, "We don't 'abhor' anything! <strong>Do you realize how many battles we've fought and won for Keves? We've served you our whole lives. And now this bollocks?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Your Majesty! Please!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You say you fight for Keves? That you've served <em>us</em>? Are you certain? Rather it seems... you have been fighting for yourselves and none other." The group gasped at the new insight{{footnote: A different way to view the same situation.}}, including Mio and the others. She continued, "You cling to life in your desperation. That is why you have fought. Unchecked, Ouroboros will lead this world to ruin. Now, by my authority, you shall perish."</p>
<p>Noah gave up convincing her, too disappointed, just like Ethel being disappointed before, "So... That's it? That's your verdict, then?"</p>
<p>N cut in, "It is not Her Majesty's 'verdict'. 'Tis the will of the world."</p>
<p>"It's what?"</p>
<p>Melia: "Indeed. The security of this world is paramount! Therefore, Ouroboros... The end is nigh... for you shall die by my hand!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and Mio dashed towards the Queen to deal damage, but there was a frequency barrier perhaps a meter in front of her that blocked them from pushing further inwards. Eunie complained while firing ranged arts with Lanz, "Wha-what the snuff is that? Stupid wall of light thing!"</p>
<p>Sena: "It's stopping our attacks in their tracks!"</p>
<p>Now her turn, the Queen raised her staff and summoned 3 fireballs, fired at them, which instantaneously regenerated, and the cycle repeats. Mio ran away, given her agility; Eunie had worse situation, but managed to hide behind Lanz, while continue firing her rifle from beside his shield. Sena was slow, felled by one of her hits.</p>
<p>"Sena!" Mio, hearing her scream and saw her dragging on the ground, panicked. Another fireball aimed at Sena... The Mondo shielded her just in time.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." The Queen turned her attention to Taion, and he could only dodged, now that he sent out his Mondo to protect someone else. She changed target once more, this time Mio. She dodged a few, felled by one.</p>
<p>"Mio!" Now, that makes Noah panic. He quickly made her way, passing from in front of Lanz and Eunie, towards her. The other two followed behind to shield him, Eunie suppressing fire did not leave a dent on the frequency shield. The Queen don't even bother.</p>
<p>As he helped her up, she apologized, "Sorry... Lost my focus." Lanz blocked the shots as they chat. "How's Sena?"</p>
<p>He don't know either. Turning around, Taion stood in front of Sena, blocking an incoming fireball. After, he sent his Mondo at the frequency shield to no avail; it burnt into dust and fell on the floor. With his Mondo as support, Sena overtook him, gathering force with her hammer, "<strong>HUHAAAAAAAAAAAAA WUAAAAAAAAA!!!</strong>" She slammed hard into the frequency shield, sending shockwaves on its surface. Thrusting forward doesn't help; the Queen look at her without even worrying. To give her a sense of danger, she slowly raise her shield, "Huh..." And of course she sensed it, hence retreating.</p>
<p>As she dashed the other direction, her head turned to witness incoming fireball, one about to hit her. The Mondos were always ready; she managed to regrouped. Eunie stood beside Taion, continued her shots.</p>
<p>Noah: "All right, then..." He slowly reached for Lucky Seven.</p>
<p>Lanz, sensing his choice, cried out, "Noah, you crazy?! That's the Queen!"</p>
<p>Grabbing on the handle, "I know... But we have to!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Even so..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Noah!</strong>" Eunie cut their conversation, bringing their focus to a giant fireball, like a tiny sun compressed and captured within a chamber. <em>This is the end</em>, N (perhaps) thought with his calmness. The fireball does drew Noah's attention away from drawing Lucky Seven, instead prepared in defensive posture against a potentially incoming blast. They were catching their breathe as they watched the fireball grew larger and larger.</p>
<p>Perhaps that drew too much energy from the Queen, or perhaps for other reasons, her neck suddenly broke with electric sparkles, and her body continued to break down. The group watched in vain, gasping.</p>
<p>Noah: "What? What's she...?"</p>
<p>A broken Queen could no longer maintain the fireball; it slowly dissipated, smaller and smaller; finally, an explosion detached her mask, his head drooped down to reveal a robotic face.</p>
<p>Noah couldn't believed his eyes, "Her Majesty is a... machine?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Spark off!"</p>
<p>Lanz, with a high tone, "You serious?!"</p>
<p>"Hm hm hm hm hm... Hahahahaha....  <strong>HAHAHAHAHAHA</strong>!!!" N put his hand over his golden mask as he laughed hard, continued asking, "Was that your doing, Queen? You haven't given up your false hope. Very well. By all means, look on." He took steps towards the group, "Witness how hollow your hope rings... as I slice it all to ribbons!" As he passed by her, he pushed her a slight push, and she fell and crashed onto the ground.</p>
<p>Noah suddenly felt the intense throbbing in his head again. "What... Again... Blast it... Why does he... make my... head hurt..." His vision blurred and he dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>That caught Lanz's attention, turning to him, shouted his question, "Noah!  What's wrong? We're not done yet! <strong>Take up your Blade!</strong>" He strugglingly got hold of his blade as he spoke.</p>
<p>Sena was equally concerned, "What's going on?!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>He didn't have time to reply any; as he stood up with his sword, N cut in, "It is fate."</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh? Fate?"</p>
<p>"Many have tried, but none have ever managed to escape its flow." He summoned his blade, which shudders like Noah's; like two magnets trying to attract towards each other but cannot.</p>
<p>Mio, looking at his sword, "What, that sword... How does he...?" Noah's sword shuddered too after N summoned his sword.</p>
<p>The battle never played out; the Castle emergency siren rung, drawing their attention. N activated his Iris and asked, "What now?"</p>
<p>"Lord High Consul! Th-the Lost Numbers are attacking!"</p>
<p>"The Lost Numbers?!" A fleet of ships approaching the Castle from the sky; anti-air weapons firing at them; those that hit blew out black soot. As they approached, automatons were dropped from below the ships that looked exactly like the ones Guernica rode on.</p>
<p>The group could now see blaring fires from within the throne room. A ship aimed directly for one of the windows smashed it into pieces, dragged on the ground before friction brought it to a halt; it didn't wait to stop when it deployed the automatons attached to its body. The group turned to see the ship stop a distance from them. As the automatons made their way, most suppressed fire, to which N drew his sword and blocked them by slicing so fast it created a semicircle shield in front of him. Other larger automatons that seemed to have flying capabilities (rather than for fighting) took off towards the birth pods.</p>
<p>As Eunie watched, she commented, "Wait, those Levnises..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Yeah, we've seen one before. Gotta be!" They were reminded of Guernica. Each of the levnises caught hold of 2 birth pods, the maximum they could take with their two grips, before returning toward their windows, prepared to leave.</p>
<p>Lanz sensed that now's the best time to escape, amidst the chaos, "Noah! Let's book it." He withdrew his blade and started running past them.</p>
<p>Taion and the others joined in, himself speaking, "Yes. They won't be attacking the Colony now. There's no point in our being here any more!" Only Noah and Mio still had their weapons on, his weapons shuddering furiously.</p>
<p>"You're right... Still..."</p>
<p>Amidst the flame and explosion, N had no fear, though he could no longer stop them from escaping. He looked at them calmly. Then, he turned to look  around him; more automatons slowly walking towards him, even if it means their death.</p>
<p>"<strong>NOAH!!!</strong>" Lanz shouted. The best time to escape is almost nigh.</p>
<p>"Nghh... All right!" As the group retreated, the transport automatons had finished catching hold of their respective (random) pods, flew from above their head towards the windows. A ship approached near the window and suppressed fire, giving time for them to escape. With the last ship leaving, the machine gun blew up the windows, and the ship turned and retreated last. The Lost Numbers had done their job; the ships dodged the anti-air weapons and retreated into the distance. Some of them were felled while retreating. One of the array of pods that escape contained Ethel in it. The gun stopped firing seeing them out of range.</p>
<p>N, looking at the mess, pressed a button and took off his mask. Looking at his palm, "The passage of fate... How easily it slips from my grasp..." Clenching his fist, "Yet perhaps, it will come within reach once more." His iris cyan-turquoise, long hair that almost cover his eyes, sharp-tipped chin.</p>
<p>"And if it does? What will you do then?" A female moebius, M, with silver leg plates entered from behind, with cat ears, wearing a silver mask, long silvery hair splashed behind her. As she approached N, she removed her mask.</p>
<p>He calmly replied, seemingly entertained by her side, "Need you ask? I will give us equilibrium. A time unchanging... Our eternity." She did not comment on his reply.</p>
<p>She had sharp-tipped chin, big eyes: yellow outer iris, purple inner iris, thin eyebrow, long eyelashes.</p>
<p><strong><em>M, is for Mio.</em></strong> <br />
<strong><em>N, is for Noah.</em></strong></p>
<p>Except, an older version of both.</p>

<p>A training ground exposed under the searing sun, located in front of a Ferronis. Agnian soldiers were practicing their skills. Guns, swords, lance, you name it. The only hammer? Sena she is, practicing alone. Bashing the ground, bashing the air, shockwaves everywhere. "Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah!" She stopped to catch her breathe.</p>
<p>"You gonna hit something or not?" From behind, someone dubiously questioned her.</p>
<p>"Huh?" She turned. Three Agnian soldiers with bullying pose looking down on her.</p>
<p>"What use is swinging that slab, if you ain't gonna swing it at one of the actual targets?"</p>
<p>"But I'm just... practicing..."</p>
<p>The female soldier to the left, from Sena's point of view, cut her off fiendishly, "Say, why a hammer?"</p>
<p>"Uh..."</p>
<p>She didn't even give her the chance to speak, withdrew her dual guns and commented, "This looks more your style." Then, she continued to dance, taking the center of the stage, showing off her skills of flinching the guns and reloading.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>The first guy agreed, "Totally..."</p>
<p>"Right?" Then, they laughed in unison as they leave, leaving Sena feeling down.</p>
<p>"Ah..."</p>
<p>As she was chained in her thoughts, "Whoa!" A group of soldiers from behind was impressed at something. Sena turned to observe what caught their attention. Behind the fence, Mio was battling against a dual-sword soldier wearing his/her helmet. Other soldiers already on the ground him/her, the only one still 'standing'. She dashed towards him/her, and with one slash, sent one of the sword high up into the air.</p>
<p>"Whoa!"</p>
<p>Sena was equally impressed, and saw Mio helped the guy up, someone near her chatting, "Spark me silly... She beat five eighth-termers in a row. Mio, eh? She that off-seer?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. She should be the one heading to the front lines, not us."</p>
<p>Sena turned to look at her hammer; the contrast between being praised and being bullied.</p>
<p>The shocking atmosphere quickly died off as the soldiers rushed off to continued whatever they're going to do. Mio exit the battling ground into the practicing area, walking towards Sena. Sena sensed her approach, wouldn't show herself feeling down, enthusiastically called out as she intercepted her, "Nice one, Mimi! That was awesome. Poor eighth-termers... You mopped the floor with them!" Then, she handed a water bottle to Mio.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Sena."</p>
<p>"Hahaha!"</p>
<p>She scanned the vicinity, "Hang on... Where's Miyabi?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Miyabi? The commander and Consul wanted to see her in Command."</p>
<p>"Oh... OK." The atmosphere suddenly felt cold as Mio probably thought about why they wanted Miyabi for, and she just waited... Mio broke the ice, "Hey, fancy a bite?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... Mmm, sure, I'm a bit peckish."</p>
<p>"It's a bit early, I s'pose."</p>
<p>"Nope! I'm ready if you are!" Then, they walked off into the distance, presumably the canteen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sitting on a 2-person table facing each other, they each were having 2 bread, 2 slices of fish on a leaves, and some red soup (carrot? tomato? other ingredients?). Both took the same set of plates.</p>
<p>Mio scanned their plates, "Huh? I was under the impression that you didn't like fish."</p>
<p>"Huh? Ah... That is true... But... Can't be too picky! My muscles need protein, y'know! Hahahah...." She tries to shake off the nervousness, but Mio wasn't convinced, nor was diverted by her recourseful{{footnote: The translator invented the word, probably (at least it's not in standard dictionary): meaning 'full of recourse'.}} tone.</p>
<p>She strictly spoke after a moment of silence, "Hey, Sena...? There's no need for this."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Just be yourself. You know you don't have to do what I do, right?"</p>
<p>Nervously shaking her head, "N... no, that's not..."</p>
<p>Then, Mio put one of her hands on her palm, trying to reassure her. Sena looked up and saw her stood up, bent forward on her, "Sena..."</p>
<p>Her tone back to low, "Uh... Sorry."</p>
<p>"C'mon... You say that too often. You've nothing to apologize for, Sena."</p>
<p>"Uh... OK..."</p>
<p>"Eat what you enjoy. Never stop being you, 'Kay?"</p>
<p>"Uhh..." She looked down, don't know what to say, nor promise anything.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back to the present.</p>
<p>The group slid through a rope connecting the castle to an island, continued to running with Noah and Mio in the lead. Panting furiously, Sena kept her look on Mio while she ran. She recalled how, in their Ouroboros form, she and Mio worked together towards destroying the annihilator. She recalled, how she slammed into the frequency shield, yet not making a dent in the throne room.</p>
<p>The island was brownish, with brown grass mostly, and greener grass up ahead. Brown cliff rocks exposed to wind erosion stood high to the right where the group was facing. Suddenly, Noah stopped, turned to face the Castle, remarked, "I think that should... be far enough." The group followed his glance after they stopped. The Castle still lurked close, though, still gigantic and tall. We could see black smoke rising from one of the part; presumably that's the damage of an exploding annihilator not put out.</p>
<p>Sena self-questioned her past actions, "Did I... do good out there...?"</p>
<p>Lanz overheard her, "Hm? What was that?"</p>
<p>She raised her tone into an uplifting one, to cover anything up, "Huh? What's that? Haha... D-did I say something?"</p>
<p>"Uhh... I mean, you just said something about doing good or whatever?"</p>
<p>"Hah! That's funny, musta just slipped out. Ahahah..." She scratched her head in nervousness. Lanz sensed some story in her that she wasn't willing to share yet. The atmosphere got cold as she don't know how to face him, nor did he laughed it off with her.</p>
<p>Lanz, after a while, commented, "Hmm... You seem so... lonely."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Recalling from what he saw when they Interlinked, he shared his observations, "<em>At training, in camp, at night...</em>" Others were speaking with each other or other soldiers, even Mio standing beside her spoke to another soldier; only herself, back laid on the fence, arms made a V (both fist joined in front of thigh), looked down, being all alone. "<em>She's always got friends right by her.</em>" Another scene, other people sat by a table, Sena sat beside Mio, but they weren't speaking to each other. "<em>But... why's it seem like... she's all alone?</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh..." She gasped.</p>
<p>"How come?"</p>
<p>Her breath was unsteady, "So that's the way you see me, huh? A loner."</p>
<p>"Sena..."</p>
<p>She tried to kept her uplifting tone, even by force, "I was hoping more... 'Plucky heroine girl', or 'one-track musclehead'. That's more what I kinda shoot for..."</p>
<p>"Now, look..."</p>
<p>"Oh, no, you don't. I think you're just being nosy!" Her tone getting more reverberating, compressing her urge to cry behind her 'happiness'.</p>
<p>"Sena... Please..."</p>
<p>"I'm fine! Really. Don't worry about me." That halts the conversation.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still at the same place, but zooming out to a group conversation at a later time,</p>
<p>Eunie: "...Can you believe we've just had to run all that way?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I don't know who they were, but had that force not intervened... I shudder to think what would have happened."</p>
<p>"What would have happened was, it would have been curtains for us."</p>
<p>"Usually a strategy is something you're supposed to prepare beforehand."</p>
<p>Noah kept quiet, lost in his thought for the moment, until Lanz turned to wake him up, "Noah?" After he turned his attention to him, Lanz continued, "I guess we have no more use for Castles and Queens, huh."</p>
<p>Eunie added, "We're not going back, I know that much."</p>
<p>Mio concur, "Nope, we're going forward now."</p>
<p>Noah: "...You're right." They turned their attention to the other direction, the great sword pierced nearer than ever before; though, they still have some distance to cross. The small hill made a bridge on top of the valley they were about to cross. "Not far now before we reach Swordmarch. Let's go."</p>

<p>The group closed in on the great sword. Higher platforms and eroded cliff rocks still lurked on both sides of the path. Giant fungi-like plants dominated the flora habitat. Air was slightly foggy.</p>
<p>The group stopped and looked up, with Eunie commenting at the scenery, "Phwoo... Well aren't you a ginormous sparker!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Whoa... Where's the top?!"</p>
<p>Noah: "We finally made it, huh..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Quite..."</p>
<p>Mio breathed out with awe, until he heard Noah, "Let's get to the base of the sword. Guernica told us to come here. There has to be something."</p>
<p>Lanz warned, "Be on your guard, yeah? 'Cause we've <strong>reeealllly</strong> been pushing our luck lately."</p>
<p>Eunie teased back at him, "Whoooa... That's one for the books."</p>
<p>"Shaddup."</p>
<p>Noah: "Lanz is right, though. Keep your eyes peeled." They still have some route to take.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Green fog enshrouded the environment. Pink, or reddish colored deer lurked the area of short trees with reddish leaves, and is that a lake? Floating jelly fish soared low above the ground. There was a firefly in the distance. Fungi, short or tall, shared the land with the trees with coral-looking leaves. Caterpillars, wolves, and eagles made it their home. There are small patches of grass with easily-ignored flowers. This, is <strong>Great Sword's Base</strong>, of Cadensia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Mio was daydreaming as they continued, when some soft sounds caught her attention. She stopped and looked up. Noah, noticing her actions, queried, "What's wrong? Mio?"</p>
<p>"I hear... a strange sound."</p>
<p>"Sound?" The group waited for whatever's lurking. A few moments later, the sound of spinning engine blades grew.</p>
<p>Taion questioned, "Wh-what is that noise?!"</p>
<p>Sena alerted, "Something's wrong here! <strong>Noah</strong>!"</p>
<p>Noah tried to sense where the sound came from. As he triangulated their position, he looked up and saw two Lost Numbers' ships exiting their cloak, slowly lowering themselves onto the ground before them. As the doors lowered, soldiers leave the ship,surrounded their flanks. The group called their weapons and be prepared for battle.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wh-what the-? Who are they?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Those Levnises{{footnote: He meant the ship}}... They're the ones that attacked the Castle."</p>
<p>Taion already noticed, "Yes, no question."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Which means...?"</p>
<p>A woman leave one of the ship, with the girl that picked up Guernica's eyepatches and followed them to the hovering reefs accompanying behind as a sidekick. Both were wearing eyepatches. They stop as the older woman, the one in the lead, observed the group.</p>
<p>Mio was observing one of the solders. They weren't drawing their weapons, just had his/her hands crossed, wearing a brown helmet with two holes for the eyes, the screen so dark she can't see his eyes. Noah was upset, moved his feet and stood in front of Mio, to protect her. Mio eyes widened at his gesture. The woman eyes tightened at what she saw. Then, she approached them.</p>
<p>Before she arrived, the brown helmet guy spoke to Noah, "Sheathe your weapons. We're not looking for a fight."</p>
<p>"What the-?"</p>
<p>Another guy to the left of the first guy explained. "We are the Lost Numbers. Sworn enemies of Moebius."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What?"</p>
<p>Taion was equally shocked, "There are others standing against Moebius?!"</p>
<p>Now that the woman and the girl arrived, the group turned their attention to the two, the only two that didn't wear a helmet.</p>
<p>"The name's <strong>Monica.</strong> Monica Vandham." She wore black tight shirt that suits for fighting, perhaps fighting suit, including gauntlets and leggings. She had short hairs, and some creeks{{footnote: wrinkles}} on her eyes. The eyes had brown iris, slightly thick eyebrows and eyelashes, with average-sized ears. Neck-long brown hair, coarsely wiggly. "The man who entrusted Ouroboros to you... I'm his daughter."</p>
<p>Eunie: "'Daughter'...?" She clearly hadn't heard of the phrase before, given that they are the only generations that don't need to give birth to anyone.</p>
<p>Noah: "You know Guernica?"</p>
<p>She nodded, continued, "You're headed for the City, ain't ya?"</p>
<p>Mio: "How do you-?"</p>
<p>"That's our base of operations. Come on."</p>
<p>"Wha...?!" While she try to convince them, they hadn't put down their weapons.</p>
<p>"<strong>Shania</strong>. Take point." Monica spoke to her sidekick, the girl with two pony tails, thin eye brows, large turquoise iris, and neck-long hairs on both side that covered her ears. She also wore a fighting suit, presumably a fighting suit, with dark red stripes on the edges. Oh, on their eyepatches, there was a symbol.{{footnote: These are related to their Houses, and we'll look at Six Houses in Appendix B.}}</p>
<p>"Yeah, all right." Shania took steps towards the group, stopped just a few steps in front of them.</p>
<p>Sena: "Uh?"</p>
<p>She scanned the group for a second before speaking, "Stay close." Then, she turned and lead the way, didn't bother to wait for them. Noah looked at Mio over his shoulders, and they both nodded to each other. Sheathing their weapons, the group followed Monica and Shania while the other soldiers watched them off.</p>
<hr />
<p>Manana turned to look at the shades of red caressed by the evening sun; the group followed glance; she commented, "Levnis from earlier disappeared in sky."</p>
<p>Monica, now had another two helmet-soldier sidekicks, agreed, "Yep. Oh, and before we take you to the City, you have to wear these." The helmet soldiers walked up to the group and distributed them eyepatches; these without any logos on them.</p>
<p>Noah: "Eyepatches?"</p>
<p>Pointing to her own eyepatches, Monica remarked, "They're the same as the ones we wear. Put them over the eye where your Iris is." Seeing them feeling dubious, she continued, "What? They won't hurt you." Noah turned to the group; they tacitly nodded to each other.</p>
<hr />
<p>(After wearing their eyepatches)</p>
<p>Monica checked that all had wore it before she continued, "Thanks for the cooperation. We appreciate this." Noah and Mio looked at each other, still aren't sure what the eyepatches are for. Monica cared to explain, "So, I said we aren't hostile, but that might not be enough to earn your trust, I'm guessing. If it lays your fears to rest, you can treat me as your prisoner until we reach the City."</p>
<p>Noah was surprised at the notion, "Huh?"</p>
<p>Eunie seconded, "Yeah, that doesn't sound right, darlin'."</p>
<p>"Don't want a prisoner? Whatever, I'll be your escort then. I should point out, you won't find anyone better with a mace in the Lost Numbers."</p>
<p>Lanz sniped back with hostility, "Yeah, well, don't bash us about with it or anything."</p>
<p>"If I wanted to, then your attitude would have earned you a thrashing already." To which he just waved his hands on the air, whatever...</p>
<p>Then, Monica walked closer to Noah and examined him; the group wasn't sure what she's up to. Noah just turned to Mio and both nodded to each other. Monica stopped her observation, turned to Shania, whom was losing patience, and continued, "So, let's be on our way. Shania'll show you how to go." She was probably relived it was time to go.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived at the base of the sword, stopped there. Lanz turned to Monica and questioned, "... And how are we meant to get to the City from here?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Um yeah, this is a dead end."</p>
<p>Monica: "Wrong." Shania walked up and the group watched the wall slid to the side; they were shocked.</p>
<p>Manana: "MEH?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "A door!"</p>
<p>Monica: "This leads into the Great Sword. The City's this way."</p>
<p>As the group walked up to the door, Taion examined it and commented, "What a masterful disguise." The door was probably very thick, probably 3 meters thick, seemingly made of metal. It's a wonder how much force required to slide it apart.</p>
<p>Mio: "Huh. When Ethel said there was nothing of interest in Swordmarch..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Guess she never found this."</p>
<p>Shania was losing her patience, urged, "Hey, you guys done? Can we get going?" She immediately walked into the great sword, which was a tunnel, the road seemingly made of metal tubings. There were sand/dirt that covered some cog wheels to the side.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group ascended an elevator, the group stood on the side with the elevator button while the Lost Numbers on the other side, all except Monica facing them. Red lights seemed to blink on the elevator button. Eunie walked forward and started a conversation, "So, Guernica, that's... That wrinkly guy...? Back then?"</p>
<p>She turned to Noah, to which he nodded, "Yeah..."</p>
<p>"You said you were his 'daughter'. What's that mean?"</p>
<p>Monica: "I completely forgot... You don't understand the concept of parenthood. I'll explain later."</p>
<p>Taion: "'Later', meaning... In the City?"</p>
<p>"That's where the elevator's taking us." Noah and Mio gasped, perhaps finally to arrive at their destination. Monica continued, "You'll be needing those eyepatches now."</p>
<p>Noah: "And what for?"</p>
<p>"Those... put a spanner{{footnote: 'Spanner' means 'wrench' online, but by contextual meaning, it probably means 'block' or 'apocrypha'.}} in Moebius's recon."</p>
<p>"Moebius's?!"</p>
<p>She nodded and continued, "When you become Ouroboros, your Irises change. And they start emitting a weak radio signal. And so... we're blocking that signal."</p>
<p>"With these things...? What about yours? Are you... Ouroboros too?"</p>
<p>"Eh, we'll go with that."</p>
<p>"Sorry...?"</p>
<p>"Ya see..." She removed her eyepatches temporarily{{footnote: Not scared of the Moebius receiving the signal temporarily, eh?}} to show the yellow Ouroboros symbol on her Iris, "We're bound by Ouroboros blood."</p>
<p>The helmet guy removed his helmet, revealed a face of slightly tanned, short thick hair, brown iris, average ears, nothing too special to describe. The other guy also removed his helmet, urr, more pale skinned, maybe? They're about the same height. Both wore the eyepatches too. {{footnote: Sorry, one had deficiency describing faces, deficient with vocabularies to describe faces, and how to describe faces. Never studied it before, and haven't study it yet.}} Monica wore back her eyepatches.</p>
<p>That makes the group more confused, Noah asking, "Just what... are you?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the elevator finally came to a halt before he had his chance to receive an answer.</p>
<hr />
<p>The peak of the sword was covered with snow. A metal meshed platform attached to the ground stretches out from the main body of the sword. The group stepped on it and stopped by its edge. Clouds were far below; while individual features were difficult to observe, we could see islands isolated by large stretches of water. Straight ahead at the 'very edge of the world', was (presumably) Agnus's Castle.</p>
<p>Lanz loved the scene, "Wahahahaha! We're so high up!"</p>
<p>Mio was enjoying it too, "What a view... I've never seen anything like it!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Certainly takes your breath away." They had a moment of silence, relaxed.</p>
<p>Shania, impatient as usual, cut the group short, "Can you save your observations for later? <em>Come on!</em>" The group turned to see her already walking away, leading the way, not waiting for their reply. Monica didn't reject, followed behind her.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> This place of snowy metal peak had its own habitat. Bunnit roamed the area. There were metal joints not shielded by fences that connected from one end of the thin platform to another thin platform. Snow-looking eagles flapped their wings and landed to rest itself. A long-winged bird soared high above without rest. Fall off and you're in oblivion. This, is <strong>Great Sword's Hilt</strong>, without a region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"Entrance's up ahead." Shania nudged to turn right at the end of the path. Two automatons and two soldiers stood at each side of the door. There was a machine with several lines on one side, unsure what it controls.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the group entered the building, in a tunnel leading up to the city, with metallic walls, Shania and Monica removed their eyepatches, turned to the group, "You can take the eyepatches off now. Won't need them past this point."</p>
<p>Noah: "O-oh, right... And you're sure about that?"</p>
<p>"The City's got some signal-jamming tech that functions just like the eyepatches, blocking detection by Moebius. We're safe inside. You have my word."</p>
<p>Taion hypothesized, "I suppose that must be the reason why they haven't been able to discover the City thus far."</p>
<p>Monica agreed, "You got that right. This place is our last redoubt, and our sole haven in this world. But as soon as we step outside, Moebius are all over us, like a bad wool sweater. So what I'm saying is, don't forget your eyepatches when you're out and about. That's all."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "I hear you, loud and clear. We'll remember." They proceed to remove their eyepatches.</p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Looking like an underground town without sunlight all day long, illuminated by light bulb surely, packed with buildings. Streetlights and shops opened on both side of the road. There were metal beams that connected above the road, with fluorescent lights installed on it. Kids were running around, some sat at the empty tables in between buildings seemingly made of metal boxes; adults just strolling or chatting with each other. Some buildings are tall, others are short; and there was an area where one of the ship parked, surrounded by containers. This, is the <strong>City</strong>, without a region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>"This is the... City?" Mio and the others were flabbergasted at the nothing-like-before scene. It looks more modern, and more differed in architecture, probably also culturally different, than their colonies. Just at the end of the tunnel was a metal-grid platform, tall enough to view the city, consisting of mostly 2-3 story buildings. Monica and Shania gave them time to awe themselves, while chatting in the distance.</p>
<p>Taion: "It sure took us long enough. <strong>We shouldn't relax just yet</strong>, though."</p>
<p>Eunie can't believe her ears, "Why the spark not?"</p>
<p>"We don't even know if they're really our allies yet. We can't get complacent."</p>
<p>Noah: "Still on guard, huh?"</p>
<p>He added some harshness to his tone, "Unlike some of your daydreamers, yes."</p>
<p>Noah turned to face the City's view, speaking with his back on him, "I'd like to believe them. Their eyes... They look the same as his." He was comparing Monica's to Guernica's.</p>
<p>Mio recalled, "They said they opposed Moebius, didn't they? It should be OK then, to trust them...?"</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "'The enemy of our enemy is our friend.' <strong>Gotcha</strong>!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Bloody sparks... Why do I bother?"</p>
<p>Noah appreciated, "Thank you, Taion. For looking out for us."</p>
<p>"Yeah, sure, whatever. I'll follow your lead. But please, stay vigilant." Eunie smiled at his reaction.</p>
<p>Seriously speaking and nodding, "Of course we will."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ouroboros...?" Shania lead the way while they walked through one of the busiest street in the city, both sides shops and markets. Male and female wearing mundane clothing stood by the side of the road, locking their gaze on the group while speaking softly of them, treating them like a group of monkey passing through the road, a rare scene, a rare species.</p>
<p>"Ouroboros, yeah."</p>
<p>"So <em>they're</em> Ouroboros?"</p>
<p>"And they're from Keves and Agnus...?"</p>
<p>"But they're just a bunch <em>o'kids!</em>"</p>
<p>"Watch yourselves! They could be secret spies!"</p>
<p>"It's over... This place'll be a warzone." Monica tailed behind. The group continued walking, not stopping to hiss at them or what.</p>
<p>Mio, her ears tall as she caught the signal from the noise, commented, "They're all whispering about us..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "I feel... we're not exactly welcome here." They groups kept their voice low.</p>
<p>Taion: "'Uninvited guests', one might say."</p>
<p>Eunie didn't understand, "They're the ones who led us here."</p>
<p>Then, something caught Sena's eyes, "Oh, hey... Doesn't she look similar to the Moebius we fought at Colony 4?" It was a man/woman with his/her back lying on the barrel.</p>
<p>Riku: "It true... Wrinkly prunefaces abound here!"</p>
<p>Then, some kids rushed past the group from the side, "Manana spy tiny people too! Is whole undiscovered race!"</p>
<p>Noah rejected her hypothesis, "No... They must be... humans just like us."</p>
<p>As they reached the end of that road into a plus ('+') junction, a group approached from the right, and a man in lead called out, "So you're Ouroboros, eh?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah stopped to face the group. Five person wearing the same black shirt, probably military. Facial features are distinguishable from their difference in eye color, slight difference in height, and hair style; but these are too difficult for the author to put into comparative words.</p>
<p>Another woman commented, "You've got what, one or two years left? Some hope you are."</p>
<p>Two of them had dark skin, but this one talking had blonde hair, "Dunno why Vandham wasted that power on you... What was he thinking?"</p>
<p>Mio felt miserable. Taion, the (only) one whom haven't put down his guard, was ready to put up a fight, "<strong>Whats your problem?! Mind your manners!</strong>"</p>
<p>Monica stepped forward as the mediator, stopped beside the other group, facing the group, "Lemme introduce ya. These were our Ouroboros candidates. They trained relentlessly to fight against Moebius... Each and every one of them. That includes Shania there." Noah turned to look at Shania to his left, while she turned to face away from them.</p>
<p>"Candidates?"</p>
<p>The other dark skin guy with dark hair made a gruff comment, "You happy? That you <em>stole</em> Ouroboros from us?"</p>
<p>The group gasped, but they understood why the sourness and bitterness in their tone.{{footnote: Note: they only understood because they say 'stole' and the word linking to their feelings. Read more later and you'll know why they haven't understood the real reason they felt upset.}}</p>
<p>Monica put an end to the heightened atmosphere, "<strong>All right, that's enough.</strong> Whatever the reason, the old man did choose 'em. To be fair, they have gone against quite a few Moebius already. They're the real thing all right. You heard Shania's reports."</p>
<p>Taion caught the words, "What reports?"</p>
<p>"I had her monitor your actions with extreme scrutiny. All the way from the valley."</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Sena turned to Shania, "Since way back then...?" They never noticed.</p>
<p>Shania: "Heh." She wasn't happy, her nose pointed up high.</p>
<p>Monica continued to persuade the five, "Together, we are united in our cause."</p>
<p>One of the woman voiced out, "Ms. Vandham..."</p>
<p>The dark skin black hair effetely replied, "Uh... All right then." Then, they leave 'admitting defeat'. He turned to take a last look at the group while continued walking over his shoulder; the group just watched them off.</p>
<p>Noah: "Hooooo....."</p>
<p>Monica now turned to the group, "Please, it's not their fault. They're not a bad lot, really."</p>
<p>Lanz gritted his teeth, his temper easily ignited, "That's easy for you to say..."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't looking very easy to put it down, either. Folded her arms, she added, "Well, that was awkward as all ash."</p>
<p>Shania spoke nothing, continued to lead the way, and the group followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>As they continued their pathway, Noah fall back to had more questions for Monica, "You, uh... You said that you were monitoring us earlier. So is that why? Why you stormed the Castle?"</p>
<p>"After the Ouroboros Stone activated, Shania relayed the info straight back to us. So I'd been looking for a chance to contact you."</p>
<p>"Oh, really?"</p>
<p>"We reckoned that you would just head straight here... What we did not expect was for you to dive straight into the heart of the enemy's base."</p>
<p>"Ah..."</p>
<p>Raising her voice, perhaps to let the whole group hearing it, "I was flipping out. Your actions were <em>so</em> reckless. I started to wonder if our 'saviors' were just a buncha ravin' lunatics. It kinda looked that way."</p>
<p>Mio spoke from over her shoulder, "That's a little..."</p>
<p>Sena finished her sentence, "Too harsh..."</p>
<p>"Heheh, sorry... Poor choice of words. How about 'hotheads'?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, that's not a lot better..." The group was currently descending a red ramp (red of wood, but also the city's dark illumination), towards a green-lit area (the end of the ramp, though some part of the red also had greens as they installed green fluorescent lamps to the side).</p>
<p>"Still, it helped us complete one of our primary objectives: Securing a number of growth modules."</p>
<p>Noah: "What are those?"</p>
<p>"I'll show you. You'll find it quite interesting. It's the very reason why we fight."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the pathway was one of the 'edge' of the city. As they peered over the fences, stood in a row, they saw a huge glass window installed below, looking down on the sword's hilt guard: an icy land not very far below littered with unburied corpses.</p>
<p>Monica: "We're now more or less above the sword's hilt guard. Even this place was once ravaged by war. By Keves and Agnus."</p>
<p>Taion questioned, "Has the war really spread this far...?"</p>
<p>Mio commented, "There's even more... More husks underneath..."</p>
<p>Eunie's eyes jittered as she saw the number of deaths piling up. Her left hand shuddered uncontrollably, and she tried to press it down with her right. Taion saw her gritting teeth and teary eyes, her shuddering body; until she felt some warm in her hands. It was... Sena; she put one of her hand over hers. "Ah... Thanks..." Sena nodded back lightly.</p>
<p>Monica continued, "This right here is what the world is really like. Designed to keep us shackled." By now, Eunie had calmed down{{footnote: reached equanimity.}}, putting her hands back to her side, and Sena turned her direction towards the husks.</p>
<p>Noah: "Keep us shackled...?" The group reminisced for a moment as they tried to think of the philosophical question Monica posed to them.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the end of the path, the double-door slid open for the group to enter. Noah took the first step into the room, followed by Mio and the others. She was first to take note to her left,  "Aren't those..."</p>
<p>Noah finished her sentence, "Cradles!" A giant glass displaying rows and rows of cylinders, each cylinder fitted with lots of orange pods. They put what they raided from the Castle here.</p>
<p>Monica explained, "Your so-called 'cradles' are the growth modules that birthed you. You were conscripted from birth, trained to kill one another ruthlessly, and steal each other's life. That life energy pours into the Flame Clocks, becoming the fuel that feeds Moebius." Noah gasped at the truth.</p>
<p>Monica continued, "In order for Moebius to exist, they must continue to claim life energy. And these 'cradles' right here... They're used to recycle your lives."  Just then, a robot/levnis delivered the growth module containing Ethel's pod, whom drove away after finishing its job. Noah fixated his eyes on this cradle.</p>
<p>Noah: "Ethel..."</p>
<p>"Yeah... You live your lives in servitude so that Moebius can exist. And even in death, there's no release. You'll just keep getting recycled."</p>
<p>Mio turned to her, "No way..."</p>
<p>Monica joined eyes with her, "There's your shackles." The group stopped as they tried to digest a concept that go against their held paradigm. She continued a moment later, "Soldiers bound by Moebius's shackles are destined only for mutual destruction. Those who lose their lives in battle, they're reborn anew... They wake from a Castle cradle, a blank slate without a scrap of their former memories."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wait... Then... that husk I saw..." Her tone dropped lower and lower as she recalled the husk she saw on the old battlefield, the fallen of the Golden Clock, <em>her</em> husk.</p>
<p>Monica didn't stop for long, "But... if we keep our lives bound to the bodies, as we're doing here, they're of no use to them. This way, we can whittle away at their power..."</p>
<p>Noah: "So you've been doing this... over and over again, then?"</p>
<p>"That's right. You don't wanna know for how long, believe me. And yet... The price we pay to take down just a handful of Moebius... is immeasurable." She closed her eyes to remember the loss. Noah clenched his fist at her words. The group caught eye with her, "The City's residents? We're all descendants of the first Ouroboros."</p>
<p>Mio: "The first Ouroboros?!"</p>
<p>Taion had heard the words a lot of time, still hadn't had a definition: "What's a 'descendant'?"</p>
<p>Monica: "Er... Right. That's not a word you'd have any use for either, I suppose. Better to see for yourselves. <strong>Come, I'll show you</strong>." She lead the way out, Shania followed immediately. The group slowly took steps.</p>
<hr />
<p>Monica and Shania brought the group to a hospital, where pregnant woman sat on their benches, while their husband stood in front, chatting with them. A husband lend a hand to a pregnant woman as she walked with care. The group was awed at the scene, surrounded by 'pot belly'.</p>
<p>Mio: "Where are we?"</p>
<p>Monica: "This is a maternity ward." She stopped and explain to them.</p>
<p>"'Maternity'?"</p>
<p>Two guys chatting heard them talking. One with gray hair, panda eyes -- probably didn't sleep well for decades. He had some tools attached to his pockets. He also wore black gloves. Another young guy of brown hair, smooth shiny jacket, wearing a watch.</p>
<p>Monica nudged to the older guy, "Doctor. May I?" The doctor turned to the young lad and spoke for a while. He nodded, and the doctor nodded back to Monica. Monica turned to the group and asked them to wait outside while she walked in, closing the door behind her. Noah turned to Mio, the others looked at each other, not sure what had happened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Noah, Eunie, and Lanz chatted in a subgroup, Taion and Sena in one, Riku and Manana another, Mio kept observing the surrounding area. She first noticed Monica opening the door, catching all others' attention, as she nudged, "Come."</p>
<p>They gathered around a bed, separated by a green curtains, which the doctor pushed it aside. A baby crying. Mio gasped as she saw the newborn. The lad that gave permission before stood beside his wife, whom held the baby by her hands.{{footnote: We'll ignore describing the cliché instruments monitoring whatever stuffs, though it's wonderful they preserved such technology after the Great Destruction by Klaus, if you know what one meant.}}</p>
<p>The man moved towards the end of the end, nudging to the group to come forward and take a closer look. The group turned to Monica, asking for attention. She nodded in return.{{footnote: One can't hold this back, but thought it would affect the mood of the main story so...: Shania kept showing her ugly dull face all the time, very, very sad, very, very depressed, looking via her bottom left at all time.}}</p>
<p>The group took steps as they tacitly organized themselves around the bed.</p>
<p>Taion commented, "It's so... small..."</p>
<p>Sena, overwhelmed in her tone, "It's a little... person!"</p>
<p>Mio bent forward to take a closer look.</p>
<p>Riku: "It so teensy-tiny, but it move!"</p>
<p>Manana: "Much rejoicing!"</p>
<p>Seeing the baby cry, Mio wasn't sure what to do, a slight panic in her tone as she attempt to think of some way to calm her down, "Uh..."</p>
<p>Her mom called out, "It's OK to touch her."</p>
<p>"Uh..."</p>
<p>"Gently now..."</p>
<p>Mio curled her fingers and gently put the back of her fingers on the baby's head; she felt the warmth she never felt before; then she held her head and gently caressed her, "She's so warm..."</p>
<p>"Place... one finger." The woman showed her pinky, to which Mio followed, "in her palm." The baby now seemed to stop crying. Mio slowly lowered her finger; as it touched her palm, the baby unconsciously grabbed it while she kept giggling. Mio gasped as she felt the connection.</p>
<p>Her eyes made rapid movements as she tried to digest what she felt. Her tone flushed with excitement, she called out, "Hey, Sena... Look at this! You need to try it too!"</p>
<p>"Hoooooo..." Taion's curiosity rocketed to maximum. He kept changing location, peering over Sena's right shoulder, over her left shoulder, as he tried to get a better look while Sena slowly touched her.</p>
<p>"Whoooa, you're right! Mimi, it's incredible!"</p>
<p>Taion finally couldn't resist it, calling out in a high tone as he shoved Sena aside, "L-let me have a turn!" He shakily lowered his hand while Mio step aside, opening the space for him. "Wh-! Hahahahah!" The joy and excitement he felt. The doctor and Monica mirrored his reaction. Looking to Sena, "This is... incredible, Sena!" She agreed with a smile.</p>
<p>Now, Noah had a turn to have his pinky grabbed by the baby, with Mio's face  beside his. He turned to look at Mio. She saw his gaze, slightly tilted her head and eyes towards him, but dared not to look at him directly, and returned a smile with a slight nod. They quickly turned their attention towards the baby thereafter.</p>
<p>Monica had their attention after they all tried, "Funny, right? But this is... human beings' true nature. If you want the ins and outs, go and ask the doctor."</p>
<p>The doctor humbly smiled at them, then called out, "All right then, lads and lasses. Who wants to know how babies are made?" He raised his hand. Everyone in the group raised their hands (and wings, for the Nopon), certainly very excited and very curious. "Hmm... Well, you're in for a surprise. <strong>Buckle up</strong>!" The group looked at each other, don't know what the surprise is.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group left the maternity ward. Gifted with their new knowledge, they now see things differently{{footnote: That is, kids no longer a different species.}}. Kids chasing after each other, passing in front of them, amidst laughters. Noah saw 3 kids gathered around as they spoke and laughed. Eunie and Taion, in another direction, saw a dad held one of the kid high up in the air while is mum watched, smiling. Other kids ran off heading to unknown direction. Where Lanz and Sena looked, an old lad and another woman walking while chatting with each other, the woman's hair gray, with wrinkles on their face.</p>
<p>In another direction where Noah{{footnote: He now turned to where Mio looked, probably, but we don't know because there's no frame that showed him turning his head.}} and Mio looked. A couple sitting on a bench under the tree dating each other, hands held together, and... they kissed each other, publicly displayed their act to the newly aware Noah and Mio. "Urg...." "Ahhhh...." Awkwardness filled the atmosphere; they unconsciously turned to each other. Their conscious mind took over a moment later, as their eyes and mouth widened, surprised that the other looking at themselves, even thinking the same. They tried to remove the awkwardness by turning their heads away simultaneously, Noah as if looking to a tree with his hands grasping his waist, Mio as if looking at the floor with his hands around her chest.</p>
<p>Monica might have noticed their reaction, don't know when appeared between them and the kissing couple. "This is how it should be. This, is human nature." She turned as she referred to the three kids speaking and laughing, then turned to the guy 'throwing' his child high up in the air, then to the old guy and woman chatting, "We are born defenseless, grow up, then those who find a spouse create new life together... age, then return to the earth.{{footnote: What a coincidence, 'Earth' as in 'Earth', or just the soil?}}"</p>
<p>That was info for the two to digest. Mio seemed to felt positive overall experience so far with the city folk.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group gathered by the memorial, where names of the soldiers were carved by the obsidian stone walls, arranged in a circle like Stonehenge; even if their corpses weren't retrieved, they will be remembered forever for their sacrifice. There, Shania handed Monica Guernica's eyepatch. "Thank you. I mean it."</p>
<p>Perhaps it's a ritual, she laid it on one of the memorial rock while Shania walked aside. The group waited while she reminisced for a moment. As she stood up, Noah immediately shot her a question,</p>
<p>"Monica... What was that word you used...? 'Spouse'?"</p>
<p>"A partner in romance."</p>
<p>Mio: "Rom-?"</p>
<p>She looked up at the names on the rock as she continued, "The feeling of having someone very precious to you... That'd be one way of putting it." Then, she turned to the memorial rock on her right, to which the group followed glance. There was a woman slightly touching the name of her loved ones, feeling it, shedding tears. Turning to another memorial rock, a man brought a male kid, perhaps his dad or his brother, reminiscing together.</p>
<p>Monica: "You'll understand too someday." Turning to the group, she saw Mio and Noah looking at each other. She recalled how Noah unconsciously shielded Mio when the Lost Numbers surrounded them. Shaking her head, "Or... It might be that you already do." Noah and Mio don't know what to say at her words, only could squeezed their eyelids a little.</p>
<p>The group had their final look at the various people standing in front of the memorials. Mio gasped at the scene that blew her mind with fresh insights. Maybe that's her purpose found, her legacy? Or perhaps she felt grateful?</p>
<hr />
<p>The group entered a room where checkered tiling filled a hexagon in the middle, and strips stretches from each of its side. Other parts were covered with black tiling. On the black tiling stood the metal statues. Shania dropped behind a lot, while Monica led the group into the room.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Taion... Look." In the middle of the hexagon was a replica of the Ouroboros Stone.</p>
<p>"Mm. It looks the same as the one before."</p>
<p>Noah scanned the surrounding statues, questioned, "Who are they?"</p>
<p>Monica: "The first Ouroboros. The Founders, we call 'em."</p>
<p>One statue, a guy, with a pair of scientific glasses (that offers intense magnification, like a portable microscope) above his head. Another wearing a long coat and a piece of cloth swaying behind his back like Batmans'. Yet another having cat ears.</p>
<p>"The first Ouroboros...?"</p>
<p>Referring to the one with cat ears, Sena: "That one... She looks a bit like Mimi."</p>
<p>Eunie's eyes turned to the next. Someone with a short jacket and a band over his head, making the Chinese posture of greeting/parting with someone (fist on your left punched onto a palm on your right).{{footnote: Though, the Chinese greeting posture should have the fingers of the palm straight, and this one wrapped around the fist, so it's not exactly the greeting posture, more like 'ready for a fight'?}} She called out: "Look at this. He's got Noah's chin!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "And the others. Don't look like anyone." Another man with sharp hair and a jacket so short it can't be tightened, showing his chest. He had buff muscles seemingly, and hair jelled. A final woman , wearing a blouse with ponytail.</p>
<p>Noah turned to Monica for an introduction, "Tell us about them."</p>
<p>She started her story, "Long, long ago, they gained the power of Ouroboros. It let them match Moebius blow-for-blow. The City folk you see here? We're all descended from them."</p>
<p>"Bound... by their blood..." To which she nodded.</p>
<p>"It was the Queens... So they say. Keves and Agnus... Their powers united created Ouroboros. Ouroboros are the only ones that can take down a Moebius. Although... there can only be six Ouroboros alive at one time."</p>
<p>Looking to the Ouroboros Stone, she continued, "By activating the stone's cage here, those with aptitude can become Ouroboros." On that comment, Shania looked down with gruesome, unsatisfied.</p>
<p>Sena: "Only six? Why so few of them...?"</p>
<p>Mio: "I get it... That's why they got... so upset." That's referring to the Ouroboros candidate.</p>
<p>Monica: "Finally clicked? There's only so many seats and Stones. The one that my father was moving, it took a long time to be found..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Noah puffed out air as the stones pressed harder on his heart.</p>
<p>Lanz had questions, "Think I'm finally getting the gist of this whole Ouroboros deal... But the Queens?"</p>
<p>Monica: "Not those sham figureheads in the Castles. <em>The real Queens.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie gave it thumbs up, "<strong>Yesss</strong>, real Queens! I knew that soulless piece of clockwork junk wasn't the real deal."</p>
<p>Mio: "Does that mean... our Queen is false too?"</p>
<p>"Mm. We're still trying to pinpoint the true Queens. They're out there somewhere, sleeping."</p>
<p>Taion: "What for?"</p>
<p>"Why else? To take our world back from Moebius, and set things to rights. The true Queens will help us there."</p>
<p>Lanz was confused, "Hang on a bleedin' second. Ouroboros were born, like 'generations' ago, right? But you said the Queens are sleeping? And there humans who can even live that long?"</p>
<p>"Now that, I don't know too much about."</p>
<p>"Then what <em>do</em> you know?"</p>
<p>"Well, the legend goes that... both of the Queens, their lifespans are supposed to be incomparably longer than ours."</p>
<p>Eunie felt unbelievable, "And you're pinning your hopes on that?"</p>
<p>"At the moment, that's about all we can do."</p>
<p>After the group took a moment to digest the new information, Noah proceeded to the next question, "All right. So... When the world is 'back to rights'... Then what?"</p>
<p>"The people you've seen here? The way they live their lives? That could be everyone. Babies, children, adults, the old... They're all a part of nature's cycle."</p>
<p>Mio: "And that would go... for us too?"</p>
<p>"Umh..." She nodded in agreement. "There'll be more to life than just fighting to survive. We'll weave the tale... that we were always meant to tell."</p>
<p>She recalled what she heard from Guernica's last moments,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Don't give up. Ten years? You kids deserve better. The only thing that can change all this... is the will of Ouroboros... you kids, and you alone...</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Monica continued with a plot twist, "Though... some of us around here still ain't too keen on the idea."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Noah: "So those people... From before...?"</p>
<p>Monica: "They're happy living in the moment. As long as they can hide away and cover their eyes, they don't give a damn about the rest." She walked past the group, stopped facing the entrance.</p>
<p>Lanz: "So our lives mean nothing to 'em?"</p>
<p>"If they can't see or hear you, then as far as they're concerned, you don't even exist."</p>
<p>Noah: "Closing their eyes... to what's in front of them."</p>
<p>"Lot o' folks here think that way."</p>
<p>Mio: "But that's... That's just like Moebius. Then the only difference is... whether or not they benefit directly."</p>
<p>"You catch on quick. I can see why my dad chose you guys." Turning to the group, "But the will of the Founders... It lives on in us warriors. Moebius can't reign forever. If we can continue freeing young folk like you... maybe life can get back to how it should be. That would be best for all of us."</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "For sure. I'm with you. I think we'd have to be lunatics not to believe you, after what you've shown us..."</p>
<p>"Ha..."</p>
<p>Mio seconded him, and got into her appreciation stance, "I believe it too. Seeing how you live your lives... It made me feel really envious. Feeling that warmth... A part of nature's cycle... We need to protect that."</p>
<p>Sena: "I agree." Mio turned to look at her, whom was looking on the ground, trying to find words to describe her feelings, "It was so... <em>precious</em>." Shania looked at her and listened to her; we don't know what's on her mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stopping outside the 'First Ouroboros' room, Monica called out, "Shania." She nodded back.</p>
<p>Riku had an urgent question: "More walking to do?" Manana was looking tired.</p>
<p>Monica: "This is the last stretch. Let's get you to the dorms." Shania turned and lead the way up the staircase to her left. The group followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of a building, with red banner hanging near the entrance, and some very short fence, probably only can prevent baby from crossing it. A man stood with his back by a beam, back leaning on it.</p>
<p>Monica: "This is the dorm for young Lost Numbers soldiers. You can sleep here while you're in the City. You can ask that guy about your rooms." She turned to that back-leaning guy and he waved back to them. Then, she continued, "Oh, and sadly, there's no kitchen in the building. A lot of the single soldiers eat at the Michiba Canteen." Then, pointing to a small 'park' surrounded by a few trees, "But if you want to do your own cooking, feel free to use that empty plot of land over there."</p>
<p>Noah: "Got it. Thank you, Monica." Manana fluttered her wings from behind, hearing the word 'cooking'.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow, we have a lot to discuss."</p>
<p>"Agreed. How shall we arrange that?"</p>
<p>"Meet me in the Lost Numbers war room. It's the place down the lift from near the Praetorian Hill which we passed on the way here. I'll let you know closer to the time." He nodded back.</p>
<p>She turned, about to leave the group alone, "Oh, before I forget. You're free to explore the City as you will."</p>
<p>Mio: "Is that really OK?"</p>
<p>"I said we weren't hostile, right? I thought you'd be pleased not to have me breathing down your necks."</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, the others equally disagreed, "No, we're grateful. Thanks for everything." Shania turned to leave, and Monica followed. The group watched them off.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the dark, outside of the dorm, at the patch of 'park' (actually a square) Monica told them where they could cook. Noah was sitting alone on a bench, looking at the trees, at the empty space, at the buildings, lost in his thoughts. He recalled conversations with Monica earlier, after visiting the statue place, on their way to the dorms.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"N, you say?"</p>
<p>"You know him?"</p>
<p>"I know of him, definitely. He's been a real thorn in the City's side."</p>
<p>"Sounds rough..."</p>
<p>"He slaughtered many of my people in cold blood."</p>
<p>"Oh..."</p>
<p>"Why bring him up?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Well... No reason."</p>
<p>"Hmm?" She felt there's something he isn't willing to say, yet. Stopping in his path, Noah turned to have a last look at the statue from the direction where he could see, the statue that made the Chinese greeting/parting posture. He felt there must be something with him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Back in the present, as he tried to sort out the linking trees of thoughts, breathing out air showing his shaky feeling. Until Mio called out from his right, "What's wrong?" She continued while he turned to face her, "Is it something Monica said? Is there a problem?"</p>
<p>"No... Don't worry about it. It's just a passing thought." He turned away from her.</p>
<p>"Yeah?" Wasn't invited into his inner mind. She continued sharing something unrelated, "Oh, I got some news earlier. We're not sleeping in tomorrow, our briefing starts early. Get some rest while you can."</p>
<p>Turning back to make eye contact with her, "Yeah... I'll do that."</p>
<p>"OK. Good night."</p>
<p>With a soft tone, "Yeah. Night." Then, she turned to head back to the dorm. He watched her leave before returning back to his thoughts. "Huh..."</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-30"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-30">Footnotes:</a></h3>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="day-2-at-the-city"><a class="header" href="#day-2-at-the-city">Day 2 at the City</a></h1>
<p>The sky was dark as ever; not a light outside can shine in despite its morning time. Noah, Riku, Eunie, and Lanz already gathered outside the dorm, Lanz stretching and commenting, "Wow, soft beds are really comfy. Who knew?"</p>
<p>Noah: "I'm fairly sure you've always slept well, even in sleeping bags."</p>
<p>"Same." Eunie acknowledged, even Riku!</p>
<p>As he waved his hands in denial to Riku's, the other four joined them, Taion expressing his concern, "You lot... Weren't you even a little nervous?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Clearly you were nervous enough for all of us, judging by those dark circles under your eyes."</p>
<p>"I couldn't just meekly go to sleep after getting here and processing all that information."</p>
<p>Eunie: "That sounds more like excitement than nerves{{footnote: Someone published a book that said nervous is excitement, they're the same feelings. Don't remember which book it is, and too lazy to search for it.}}, if you ask me..." He pushed his glasses up, perhaps not willing to deny.</p>
<p>Mio took steps toward Noah, so they could speak closer, "Well, it looks like last night's jumble of information will be sorted out in the war room."</p>
<p>"Right." They turned to Taion, attempting to calm his nerves. Sena clenched her fist to muster her courage.</p>
<p>Taion: "...We should probably start making a move over to the war room, then."</p>
<p>"Right, agreed."</p>
<p>Sena: "Monica said-"</p>
<p>Mio: "You take the lift down from near by the Praetorian Hill, right? That's the sword's hilt guard..."</p>
<p>Eunie complained, "All the way there, huh?{{footnote: It was on the other side of the city, if one remembered correctly.}} OK then."</p>
<p>Sena gave her the encouragement, "Yep!" The group started their morning walk.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the war room, underground. The group gathered beside a "pool table" (probably Intel table); Monica just finished her introduction. The room was dark and small, with no other apparent apparatus standing out.</p>
<p>Noah, his arm folded around his chest, "OK then. Sneaking into Agnus Castle, huh...?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Seems we won't be catching a break any time soon..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So this person who knows where the true Queens are... Uhh... Who was it again?"</p>
<p>Monica: "You're looking for Ghondor."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's right! So then... we've just gotta find this Ghondor, break 'em out of the prison camp, and get the spark outta there?"</p>
<p>"Mm. Luckily, they don't kill us immediately after we've been captured. We're held beneath the Castle, in a detention facility."</p>
<p>Taion: "To perform, forced labor?"</p>
<p>"There's that as well. But mostly, it's to set an example."</p>
<p>"Example?"</p>
<p>"On the day of an eclipse, once a year{{footnote: OK, their eclipse was once a year, not like us irregular dates.}}, they hold a massive execution of prisoners at Hope's Rest, a hill on the Castle's south edge. The whole event gets projected... High into the sky."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A place looking out; the surrounding is dark, but we can see a semicircle hole in front, with several broken metals sticking out of its circumference. AT the edge was some fence. The air was foggy; smog brown, as if heavy with pollution. The sun was almost eaten by the moon. Suddenly, an oval screen without visible edge showed up on the sky, showing Agnian soldiers grabbing a Lost Number's soldier, pushing against him to knelt him down on to the floor. Another Agnian approached from the other side, summoned his/her long sword blade. Repeat this for all the other soldiers in a row. A duck-helmet Moebius stood beside a one-eyed Agnian commander. He slashed his finger down, signifying the start of execution. The solders each raised their sword over their head, and down it go!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, "Oh no... So that's what you meant." Perhaps they had seen it before? We don't know.</p>
<p>"It's to show us we're powerless."</p>
<p>Lanz: "And the place they do this is 'Hope's Rest'? What kinda sick joke is that?" The group fell into a low mood as they absorbed what they'd been told, until Monica touched twice her temple to bring up her iris{{footnote: Wait, they have irises???}}.</p>
<p>"The next eclipse falls, about a month from now... So that's our deadline for what we've gotta do: contact the prisoner and get the intel on the Queens."</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>A month</em>..." She gently touched her term symbol on her neck. Now that's a real <strong>dead</strong>line.</p>
<p>Noah was triggered, turn his attention to her, "Mio..." Taion too.</p>
<p>Until Lanz enthusiastically and loudly stopped the ninny-nanny, "Well, no two ways about it. We better get started... now!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah. And we better hurry. <strong>We can't waste a single day.</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Let's say we make it in without a hitch. Won't the you-know-what give us away?"</p>
<p>You know what? What you know what? Sena asked for the group, "Eunie, I don't think we do know..."</p>
<p>"The red glowing Moebius eye thing." She do a pinch around her eyes to demonstrate.</p>
<p>"Ohhh, thaaaaat..."</p>
<p>Monica had an answer. "Those eyepatches I gave ya? There's a special alloy embedded in 'em. Long as you got that, you'll be near invisible -- slip clean under their noses."</p>
<p>Noah: "And after we've got the info? How do we get out?"</p>
<p>"You've put the Kevesi Annihilator out of commission. <em>I'm sure you'll think of something.</em>{{footnote: Italics are spoken in a relatively relaxed manner.}}"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Even if <em>we</em> get out, what about your lot?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to worry about them. They knew the risk."</p>
<p>Taion don't agree, "That doesn't make it OK."</p>
<p>Monica folded her arms, "Yeah, well. That's how we do things."{{footnote: When all is against odds, you use lives to fill the void, the difference.}}</p>
<p>"But still..."</p>
<p>She spoke it crystal clear, her eyes boldly fixed on him: "I'll tell you too. <strong>Be prepared to make sacrifices</strong>."</p>
<p>The group digested her stiff words for a moment, until Noah agreed, "Hrrr... All right."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>" Mio was shocked and surprised. Putting their lives at risk wasn't what they would agree on so far{{footnote: One could speak a lot about here, say, what Taion had done and analyzed in the desert, etc., but that would be "watery words."}}, "However... <strong>Only as our absolute last resort.</strong> Is that fair?"</p>
<p>She was surprised too at their agreement, "<em>That's awfully kind of you</em>. <strong>But 'kind' doesn't win wars</strong>.{{footnote: Italics check footnote before. Bold was spoken in a gritted-teeth manner.}} There's a Nopon called Samon in engineering. He'll be able to find you a way into the Castle. Get the details from him."</p>
<hr />
<p>Not far outside the war room, the group was asking a member of the Ouroboros candidate called Olive for direction. "Mr. Samon's engineering department? Go down the lift near Dolgan Cliff and you'll find it in no time. It's the big lift you took to get up here. You know the one?"</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Right."</p>
<p>"Well, that's it! Ciao!" She turned to join her group, 4 others except Shania was present, waiting for her. To their 4 o'clock, an automaton stood in front of a beam incandescent glowing light scanning the area.</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't happy with how they're treated, "Oh what, you're not gonna show us the way?"</p>
<p>A guy called Jensen overheard his complaint, "There's a strategy meeting we have to be at, discussing what to do after the infiltration. "</p>
<p>Mio: "Oh, you're infiltrating the prison too?"</p>
<p>"Well, it was originally <em>our</em> plan." He bit his tongue; still being bitter towards the group.</p>
<p>Noah: "I see. Looking forward to working with you, then."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Yeah, sorry, not going to be al buddy-buddy with you." The group watched them leave.</p>
<p>Eunie spit out after they'd gone some distance, "Wow, what crawled up his arse?"</p>
<p>Taion tried putting himself in their shoes, "Look at it from their perspective. We essentially took the Ouroboros powers that were originally intended for them."</p>
<p>Sena rebutted, "But..."</p>
<p>Lanz continued her statement, "What does that have to do with any of this?"</p>
<p>Noah stopped them lingering on the topic for too long, "Let's just play our part for now. We should head to engineering."</p>
<hr />
<p>A place outside the City; the group stepped on a metal grid. Below them was a pool of water, an army-colored boat too difficult to describe, parked beside. The group approached a yellow Nopon with a hammer latched behind him.</p>
<p>"Excuse me, are you Samon?"</p>
<p>He had a flowery hair, and two thick moustache to the side of his mouth, wearing a vest, and some tool 'bag' strapped to it. "Most indeed! And are friends famed Ouroboros? I hear everything from Monica. Will lend spare ship to friends, no worry."</p>
<p>"Thank you very much for this."{{footnote: The extra hero accompanying was <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Ashera">Ashera</a>. She was the commander of Colony 11, Colony 11 being the 'final gate' located directly outside of the Keves Castle main entrance. We saw it before: the group moved aside and swing through the hovering reefs instead.}}</p>
<p>To one's best, the ship shaped like a bullet train, with yellow-orange lights attached to random location on its hull. The front part of the ship had roof; while the deck was behind it. "She good ship. 'Boundary' the name. Friends feel free to use."</p>
<p>Lanz was impressed, "Whoa, nice piece of kit, this!"</p>
<p>Eunie too, "I've never seen a real ship before, except in the textbooks..."</p>
<p>Samon: "If friends feeling gratitude, can show respect by adding Mr. to start of name." When a professor become a professor, you cannot not add the professor in front of his/her name!</p>
<p>Taion: "...Mr. Samon. Uh, sorry to cut the pleasantries short, but could you tell us more about the infiltration plan?"</p>
<p>"At least ask about boat first, meh..." A Nopon engineers' desire to show off his engineering design cannot be matched by anything unrelated to engineering! "Bah... Fine. Samon explain, so listen up. Surrounding of Agnus Castle under exceptionally strict guard. Nothing to unexpect. Even with the most state-of-art cloaking device, approach by Levnis greeted with shooting and shouting and short sharp landing. That why, we plan approach on route that go around Erythia Sea."</p>
<p>Taion: "From the sea, huh..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wait, if they discover us in the drink, then aren't we really royally snuffed?"</p>
<p>"Erythia Sea shrouded in black fog. If use ship to glide along on surface of sea, will now show up on radar scan from above."</p>
<p>Mio: "Right, good thinking."</p>
<p>Samon: "Before proceed to explain nitty-gritty, we must make ship ship-shape. Friends have to help also."</p>
<p>Riku was surprised, given the ship looking complete from the outside, "It not run as is?"</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "There not enough fuel for runnage of Boundary."</p>
<p>Noah: "Ah, so that's the problem."</p>
<p>Sena felt excited for the need of muscles! "Sounds like you need some good old-fashioned physical labor. Sign me up!"</p>
<p>"Samon happy to see friend so enthusiastic! Could never hope to even carry 300 ether cylinder by own self, so things were looking choppy."</p>
<p>The group was shocked, Eunie taking a step back, "Th-th-three hundred?!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Do we really need that many...?"</p>
<p>"Friends must remember, once depart on ship, there nowhere to top up before land of destination."</p>
<p>Noah, scratching his head, "That does make sense..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Sure, but where the spark are we gonna find that many cylinders?"</p>
<p>"Not here, that for sure. We pour all fuel we had into making prototype."</p>
<p>Taion: "In other words... We have to figure out the whole supply chain from nothing?"</p>
<p>Samon tightened his eyes for concealing the info initially{{footnote: Who call you don't ask about ship details first?}}, "Perish thought, friend! Samon never expect friends could provide alone. Only need to assist associate of Samon. Would like friends to go see Timna and explain situation."</p>
<p>Mio: "And that person can get us the cylinders?"</p>
<p>"Assuredly! Timna come from one of Six mighty Houses. Should be no big deal to part with hundred ether cylinder, or even thousand."</p>
<p>Sena was curious, "What are these Six Houses?"{{footnote: Check Appendix B for more info. In brief, the 6 monuments from the <strong>Memorial Hall</strong>, or First Ouroboros room, created the 6 houses.}}</p>
<p>"Very fancy houses, in holding of very important people."</p>
<p>Mio don't care about the explanation for now, at least this isn't the time, "All right, we got it. Where can we find this Timna?"</p>
<p>"In Caelum Residential Quarter of City."</p>
<p>Noah: "Great. Let's go, then."</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside the front door of a house, inside the City. An old woman wearing a thick brown jacket stood facing them. Noah started the conversation, "Ms. Timna? We've come on an errand from Samon."</p>
<p>Correct person. She replied, "Oh, really? And what might he need?"</p>
<p>Scratching his head, he wasn't sure how to open his mouth, "Well, he's found himself quite urgently needing a large quantity of fuel, so..."</p>
<p>"I don't need the preambles, duck. This is Samon we're talking about. I'm sure he's got a whole lot of guff to sell me." They have different thoughts on how investment works!</p>
<p>Mio: "Well, I wouldn't quite-"</p>
<p>Her time is vital, her patience is utmost, "It's quite all right. What's he after? Tell me plainly."</p>
<p>Noah blurted out, "300 ether cylinders..."</p>
<p>"Planning something big again, isn't he?" Wasn't a tad bit surprise, nodded, "Not to worry. I'll have them prepared... Or, well, I'd love to do that for you, but lately, the conservative lot have been buzzing around. Such a pain." Shaking her head, "The truth is, we haven't been able to secure a surplus for ourselves, either."</p>
<p>Sena haven't heard of the word before, "The conserva-what now?"</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "They're the people who don't welcome war, perhaps."</p>
<p>Timna saw his wit, "It seems you know enough to recognize. Not all of this great City's people think the same way." Closing her eyes, she felt a lack of choice on convincing the conservatives, "Some are happy to remain spectators in the conflict taking place outside our door. Not fight Moebius, maintain the status quo... They want nothing more than to seal the City's hatches, build up our defenses. Lots of conservative people like that here. But... do pardon an old woman for that tangent. We were talking about ether cylinders... Their lot has been stockpiling more than they need, all just to cock a snook at us. You should get what you need from them."</p>
<p>Eunie was confused, "Huh? Didn't you just say you didn't like each other...?"</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean there aren't any sensible people on that side too."</p>
<p>Taion got the picture, "I see... So even your separate factions are comprised of varying types, then?"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Well, maybe we should pay a visit to one of these sensible people, then!"</p>
<p>Timna agreed, "Please do. Speak to Miyori. She's the person in charge of the material storage warehouse. If you tell her that <em>'the Nopon's needs are many</em>', the conversation should go smoothly."</p>
<p>Sena wondered what that means, "'The Nopon's needs are many'...?" Manana turned to her and showed her curiosity too...</p>
<p>Timna gave a warning, "The material storage warehouse is outside the City. Mind how you go." Yeah, the inhabitants{{footnote: The monsters, and don't fall off the cliff!}}!</p>
<p>Noah acknowledged, "Understood. Thanks for your help."</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside the city, amidst the Great Sword's Hilt, standing on the snowy floor, the wind blew hard. The group was speaking to a short hair woman wearing buckled-up dark green shirt, long pants, and knee-long boots, gloves, and her own eyepatches with her house symbol{{footnote: Yeah, from the Six Houses.}} on it, and displayed a bright green iris on her other uncovered eye. Eunie prompted, "Hey, are you Miyori?"</p>
<p>Miyori impatiently asked, "What?"</p>
<p>Noah explained, "Ms. Timna sent us. We're trying to get some ether cylinders..."</p>
<p>"Timna did...? Well, is that all? She didn't give you a message or something?"</p>
<p>Scratching his head, "Huh? A message?" He'd already forgotten about <em>the</em> message.</p>
<p>Eunie tried thinking harder, "Don't think I remember anything like that..."</p>
<p>She was firm. "Right. No deal, then. You can leave now."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Whuh?!"</p>
<p>Taion tried to convince, "Look, this isn't what we were told..."</p>
<p>She don't care what they were told, turned her back to them, "I'm a busy gal, OK? Beat it." She then walked away, leaving the group in the cold snow.</p>
<p>Mio shouted, "Hey wait!"</p>
<p>Riku: "Suggest to abandon hope."</p>
<p>Manana: "She give coldest shoulder."</p>
<p>Sena thought for a while, "Erm... <strong>Oh, right!</strong> She said to mention that 'the Nopon needs his money'!"</p>
<p>"...!" Miyori turned to her message, walked to her for code confirmation{{footnote: Felt like 'Open Sesame' said wrongly.}}, "Is that really what she said? To the word, to the letter? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>Scratching her head and try and recall, "Huh? Oh, uhhh... Was it 'needs are many', instead?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes.</strong> Now I get it. I'll get them ready for you."</p>
<p>"Really?! Thanks so much!"</p>
<p>Manana was surprised, "Great success!"</p>
<p>Taion sees the reason why they were given an Open Sesame sentence, "... I see. So that's what she meant by 'the conversation going smoothly'." They haven't bothered with the message before, thought it worth nothing.</p>
<p>Lanz didn't get it yet, "Huh?"</p>
<p>Manana explained, in the best of her guess, "It mean this person big Nopon fan! Only reasonable, really."</p>
<p>Timna asked for the quantities, "So, how many do you need?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Erm, 300 ether cylinders. Is that... manageable...?"</p>
<p>"I'll check. Hold tight. Also, don't let anyone near the storage."</p>
<p>"Sure thing..." She ducked into the storage, closing the bulky door behind her.</p>
<p>Lanz can now complain with her outside hearing range, throwing his hands high into the air, "Don't let anyone near? Pfft, like anyone'd bother coming out here without a rock-solid reason..."</p>
<p>Taion tried thinking from her side, "It sounded like the faction she belongs to doesn't want any involvement with us. I imagine she doesn't want to be suspected of helping Ouroboros."</p>
<p>Lanz suggested, "Hmph... Well then, should we give her a hand? The faster it's done, the sooner we can be out of her hair."</p>
<p>(Here, the player get to choose to 'help her' or 'stay put'. We chose to 'help her'.)</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "You're right. We did ask for quite a few..."</p>
<p>Mio convinced themselves with the logic, "It'll be quicker with more hands, right? ...Huh?" Suddenly, she heard something, turned around and looked into the air.</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "Something up, Mimi?"</p>
<p>Getting into defensive stance, "I just heard something. It's coming this way..." The group saw blue-winged white-torso eagles, five of them, descended in front of them.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Whoa! Check 'em out..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Why are they so big...?" Ok, wrong focus, but oh well...</p>
<p>Noah withdrew his blades, gave instructions for attack, "Let's take them out before things get messy."</p>
<p>Mio followed, "I'm with you!" The rest called their blades after the two.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the battle. The group sheathed their weapons as Miyori exited the storage, questioning, "I heard a ruckus out here. Anything I need to worry about?"</p>
<p>Lanz affirmed, "Not even slightly. Nobody's here."</p>
<p>"Right. I've prepared the ether cylinders. Take them and go."</p>
<p>Noah nodded with "Thanks." They went inside and helped transporting it to Samon.</p>
<hr />
<p>Samon flapped his wings in excitement, "Job well done. Samon pull all-nighter to install. Expect to be ship-shape by tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>Eunie was impressed at his speed, "That soon?!"</p>
<p>With pride, "Samon never flounder. Always get job done."</p>
<p>Mio appreciated, "Thank you, so much."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Thanking not necessary. Samon is fixer-upper-er by trade!"</p>
<p>The blueprints on the table behind Samon caught Noah's attention, "What's that?"</p>
<p>He turned to it, looked at what he was referring to, and explained, "Ah, this is ultimate vessel."</p>
<p>"Ultimate... vessel?"</p>
<p>"That right." It was the blueprints of the ship from different point of view, but seemingly had four boosters attached to its side, like the rocket boosters on the Lost Number's levnises/ships. "Even vortex in raging Great Sea not slow advance. It go down in history as queen of boats!{{footnote: One don't really understand what these two sentences meant, but assumed it was a boat meant to penetrate the vortex.}} Still work in progress, but sure to bring to fruition someday. Is Samon's dream!" He flapped his wings in excitement.</p>
<p>"Wow..." That design surely carved deep into Noah's mind.</p>

<p>Night time at the City Camp{{footnote: The cooking square Monica lent them just outside their dorms if they wanted to cooked earlier when they'd arrived at the City.}}, Mio noted an observation, "It seems that they believe in Fourtune Clovers in the City as well."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What can I say? If you know, you know. And if you know, you're gonna wanna collect them!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Isn't it mysterious? Seeing children talk about things never fails to bring a smile."</p>
<p>Sena: "Oh yeah, it is mostly children collecting them, that's right!"</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't very happy at that comment, "... You got a point to make, Sena, love?"{{footnote: So she's a child collecting Fourtune Clovers, huh!}}</p>
<p>"<strong>Oops!</strong> N-no, not really..."</p>
<p>Lanz just laughed at her, "AHAHAHA! You wanna go join the City brats, Eunie? Sounds like you'll have a lot in common!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Augh... You absolute muppet!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Come on Eunie, no need to get worked up."</p>
<p>"Queen's laces, you lot... Let a girl have her hobbies, will ya?"</p>
<p>Noah redirected the conversation, "That's right... If they grow near the City as well, then we could have a little excursion someday."</p>
<p>"You're the only one here I can trust, Noah..."</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group continued chatting in subgroups, Noah received a video call, "<strong>Noah!</strong> Hey. How's tricks?" The others joined themselves on the call thereafter.</p>
<p>"We're doing fine here, Bolearis. And you?"</p>
<p>"Ahhhh, same old, same old. Though, we're not getting any provisions from home, so our supply guys are being run ragged."</p>
<p>"Any requests for us? I don't imagine you called just to shoot the breeze."</p>
<p>"Haha, no. Good point. Got a bit of info to share with you."</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"Specifically, it's about Colony 5."</p>
<p>"<em>Colony 5</em>... I think... I remember something about them being pretty highly ranked."</p>
<p>"Yeah. We only happened to hear by chance, but apparently, they made Gold just the other day." Noah's eyes brightened up... Gold! That's not an easy feats. Bolearis continued, "Or so it seems, but we're not sure."</p>
<p>"Oh? Go on." Taion's curiosity was piqued.</p>
<p>"Last time a colony went Gold? Think it was about forty years ago. When you go Gold, you're pardoned from fighting. <strong>That's</strong> why everybody busts their balls trying to rank up."</p>
<p>Lanz: "That sounds... pretty familiar."</p>
<p>"Thing is... <em>We're not even hearing a peep about this from the other colonies</em>. It's as if... they're acting like Colony 5 <em>never existed to start with</em>. I've tried getting in direct contact with them, but I haven't heard a fart back."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "You think something happened?"</p>
<p>"Well, the woman in charge of Colony 5, Orsolya, was close friends with our commander."</p>
<p>Mio: "With Ethel?"</p>
<p>"To give you some background, some two years after the commander got us to Silver, Orsolya managed it as well. Cammuravi might have been Ethel's rival, but Orsolya and Ethel... They were sworn friends."</p>
<p>"What, so... if it wasn't for the thing with Cammuravi, you all would have made it to Gold rank?"</p>
<p>"<em>Ehhh</em>, I guess you could say it was likely."</p>
<p>"Then... I can see why you'd be worried."</p>
<p>"Yup. So I was thinking of going to take a look. Been six days since we <em>lost contact</em>. If there's been some accident, we could still be able to help."</p>
<p>Lanz questioned, "<em>Are you sure that's a good idea?</em> You got not Flame Clocks! What if you end up like us?" And even Gold cannot solve the problem, what says you Dirt?</p>
<p>"We'll get the spark out of there before that happens. But <em>I'm talking about Orsolya here. I ain't just gonna leave her</em>. And if the commander was here, she'd do the exact same thing."</p>
<p>Eunie suddenly spurted out, "<strong>I-I really wanna help out on this!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Whoooooaaaa!!!"</p>
<p>Even Noah was surprised, "Eunie? Seems out of the blue."</p>
<p>She cancelled the call (the others not) to take out something from her pocket, "<em>Well, you see</em>..." It was her dog tag, the dog tag of the before-incarnation Eunie and the Golden Colony... She then told them about how she found the dog tag{{footnote: One wouldn't repeat what's going on in the battlefield back there. Just look back yourself!}}, after so long.</p>
<p>Lanz just heard her story, shocked, "<strong>What the-</strong> <em>Why didn't you tell us this sooner</em>?! Gotta share this stuff!" The others had already hung their call with Bolearis, gathered around her to hear her story.</p>
<p>Guiltily, she replied, "<em>Sorry... I just... didn't really believe it.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "So, what you're saying is, you think that in the past, you were attached to a Gold-rank colony."</p>
<p>"<em>Could be</em>." As she gripped on to her dog tag, she continued, "This ain't some ash about wanting to know my past self or anything. <strong>A whole colony just fell to pieces</strong>. <em>I have to know why.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz prompted deeper, "You reckon Moebius have something to do with it?"</p>
<p>"With what I saw? <em>Definitely</em>."</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>So that's why</em>. All right. We'll help you out."</p>
<p>"Noah, I mean... Are you sure?" Bolearis from the other end still hadn't hung the call, and can still reach them despite they hung the call. "You know, I'd be glad for the help here, sure, but I really wouldn't want-"</p>
<p>Taion cut him off short, had had enough,{{footnote: After he reconnected to the call, of course.}}, "Oh, <em>enough of this already</em>. Tell me this isn't <strong>exactly</strong> what you were hoping for."</p>
<p>"<strong>Heheh</strong>! Saw through my clever ruse, eh? <em>Must be losin' my touch. Hehe</em>..."</p>
<p>Hanging the call, he turned to Noah, still connected to the call himself, "I've seen that memory too, when Interlinking with Eunie. And I guarantee you it was not a dream. <strong>I'm certain of it.</strong>"</p>
<p>"True. I feel the same. What do you two think?"</p>
<p>Mio: "No objections! Let's head out."</p>
<p>Sena showed her muscle, "<strong>Yeah, I wanna lend a hand as well!</strong>"</p>
<p>"There you go, OK?"</p>
<p>"Ahh, I owe you one, mate. <strong>Seems like I'm always getting you in trouble.</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's fine, Bolearis. We do have an 'obligation' here. Right?" Noah turned to Taion therefore, and he returned a nod.</p>
<p>Sena: "Man, not to forget all that food you gave us...!"</p>
<p>Mio teased, "Ohhh yeah, I remember you took seconds."</p>
<p>"Righto. I'll be moving out after this. Let's rendezvous... around here." He showed the group a map and a point.</p>
<p>Noah: "The Urayan Trail? Understood. We'll give our stuff a once-over, then get going."</p>
<p>"<em>A'ight</em>. See you there."</p>
<p>"Yeah, see you."</p>
<p>After he ended the call, Manana asked immediately, "Noah? Friends make journey to Goldie colony?"</p>
<p>"Yep, that's the plan."</p>
<p>"Then, humbly asking to drag Manana along!"</p>
<p>"No problem, but why?"</p>
<p>"Manana heard rumorings! Say that Goldie colonies have <strong>suuuuper real good</strong> ingredients lying around! Manana will <strong>take</strong> these ingredients. <strong>Resulting dishes will blow both socks and minds!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Trying to expand the old repertoire, eh, Manana?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Expand!</strong>" The wings fluttered thinking about food and cooking!</p>
<p>Noah: "That'd be really great actually. <strong>OK</strong>. Dunno why I'd ever refuse."</p>
<p>Sena: "Manana, if you're going..." She and Mio turned to their obvious target. Without a second thought, he replied,</p>
<p>"Riku go, naturalistic. Only answer is yes."</p>
<p>Noah: "I <em>just</em> said I won't refuse! We can all go."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note on Environment</strong>: The Urayan Trial was behind a giant door near where Ethel and Cammuravi fought the group and died. Neighboring the Fornis Region, naturally we saw the modern dilapidated buildings encroaching in the distance. The lush grass carpeted the soil; with lush green trees sparsely shadowing a portion of the land together with the tall, standing, monument-like rocks. Bunnits, Tirkins, and other animals roamed the area. In the distance, we could see giant trees and the forest. It was a one-way road that zig and zag through areas. This, is the <strong>Urayan Trail</strong>, of Pentelas Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived before Bolearis. "Hey there, you lot. Fast as a sparkin' Rhogul!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Well, we would hate to keep you waiting."</p>
<p>"Good man."</p>
<p>Noah got straight to the point, "So where's Colony 5?"</p>
<p>Looking towards a route heading 'forward', Bolearis pointed out, "Easy. It's up on the Loska Plateau. Should see it once you've cleared the cave."</p>
<p>Eunie urged, "What are we waitin' for then? This bloody murk's giving me the creeps."</p>
<p>Riku wasn't happy with the impatience, "<strong>Eunie should cool jets. Getting in tizz won't help.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You'll be in a tizz in a minute!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah agreed with Riku, "All he's saying is that we should play it safe. <em>Careful</em>. Right?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Correct!</strong> Especially if situation involve <em>Moebius creeps</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>All riiiighttt... I am actually tryin' to control myself. If I start going crazy, nudge me.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz was surprised, "<strong>WHOOOOAAAAA!!!</strong> Where's the real Eunie?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I just don't want us draggin' our feet, all right?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Heh!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Traversing through the caverns lit by a three-legged fire stove {{footnote: Just a platter where you put woods or other burnables into it and lit it on fire.}}, they stopped as they saw some fallen Kevesi soldiers.</p>
<p>"<em>Husks... They're still flesh.</em>" Taion observed carefully.</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah... This wasn't long ago. Who could've done 'em in?</em>" Lanz agreed. The group tried looking around, kept their voice low in case it attracted their potential enemies. Nothing else to be seen. They continued to their destination therefore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still inside the cavern, the group searched the cavern walls and grounds for evidence and traces. Taion looked attentively at one of the walls and Noah joined him. "<em>Noah. These marks... Considering their elevation... It can only be</em>..."{{footnote: Unfortunatley one can't see any marks on the rocks. Looks the same to one. Will update if can see on first video.}}</p>
<p>"<em>Right. Only something as big as Ouroboros or Moebius... could make these</em>."</p>
<p>Lanz traversed into a narrow tunnel himself with the group behind him, looking around, when a Kevesi sword suddenly summoned in front of him, and his gasped attracted the others' attention. Mio and Sena, closed to him, joined in the fight while the others joined later against the few Kevesi soldiers.</p>
<hr />
<p>One of the Kevesi soldiers with wings on his head called out halfway, "<strong>Stand fast! Cease combat!</strong>" He looked on the group and noticed one that he knew, "Y-you're Bolearis, right? Ethel's man. From Colony 4."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p>Looking at the others, their blades still held up in defensive form, "Then you guys... you... <em>couldn't be</em>..."</p>
<p>Taion nudged, "Couldn't be what?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer, denied himself, "No, can't be. You aren't friends with that monster, are you?"</p>
<p>Sena: "With what monster?"</p>
<p>"Thank the flames..."</p>
<p>Noah was confused: "Huh?" They sheathed their blades and gathered near one of the rocks where they'd rested. Illuminations came only from the three-legged stove fire some distance away.</p>
<p>The winged guy started telling their story in a wimpy voice, "It happened so fast. First the commander was promoted to Gold, and the night after that, that thing came."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amidst flames stood the Ferronis, Moebius transformed and killed lots of soldiers. It had a rounded hat like a built-in helmet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You could tell it wasn't Agnian. Nothing native to these parts -- could tell at a glance. It was cackling. Having fun cutting our friends... to shreds!"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As it killed one by one, "HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!" It walked slowly, enjoyed the torturous death of the group. "<strong>AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eunie concluded: "That'd be Moebius. Has to be."</p>
<p>Taion questioned: "Yes, but... why attack Colony 5?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "We came to find that out, right? Think. Must be a reason."</p>
<p>Bolearis: "And the colony? How's Orsolya?"</p>
<p>"No clue. We were in such a hurry to save our skin... Scrambling for a place to hide... <em>Then you guys showed up</em>..."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>Mio proposed, "Well, she can't be all that far off. Shall we?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Spark, yeah. <em>And if any Moebius mudders are there, we mess 'em up</em>."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Yeah</em>. Looking at these guys, they don't seem under Moebius control. But that makes them targets we need to protect."</p>
<p>Noah: "No argument there."</p>
<p>The winged guy finally got curious, "Who are you guys...? You're working with Agnus..."</p>
<p>Bolearis decided to move forward first, "Once we're done here I'll tell you all you wanna know. It'll blow your mind! <strong>OK! Let's get a move on, eh?</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Before we do, we should escort these guys somewhere safe. Some of them are wounded."</p>
<p>Bolearis: "Ahh, too true. Definitely don't want them in combat. How about the cave entrance? They'll be as safe as Castles."</p>
<p>"Cave entrance, huh? <strong>Yeah, that'll work</strong>."</p>
<p>The winged man, "I, um... We owe you."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the cave entrance, Bolearis consulted, "You lot sit tight here. We'll press on to Colony 5."</p>
<p>"Thanks. It's really us who should be going, but... How can we ever thank you?"</p>
<p>He nudged instead towards the Ouroboros, "These guys are doing all the fighting. Thank them -- I'm just along for the ride."</p>
<p>Eunie effetely complimented, "Ohhh, cheers."</p>
<p>"Hahahaha... Ahhhh, come on..." And she just gave him <em>'that'</em> look, as in, 'whatever'. Turning back to the soldiers, "Anyway, you just leave finding Orsolya to us." They then leave them alone, continuing to Loska Plateau.</p>
<hr />
<p>By an empty ground surrounded by tall cliff walls, barracks lining both sides, and an extremely tall Ferronis connecting its upper torso to its lower via a thin skeleton stood at the end. Sena noted, "The Flame Clock... It's still glowing!" They dashed forward to see the final of the flames choking its way to keep alive. Closing in, Sena judged its gauge, "<em>Huh!... Oh no... Almost empty...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "There... really can't be a lot of soldiers left." The rest watched attentively at the Clock for a while as they absorbed the info. Turning their attention elsewhere, husks lying on the floor everywhere. Eunie especially felt the pain. Suddenly, she heard some slicing of blades and turned to look at where it came from: from behind one of the barracks, red live motes shot up into the air. She quickly dashed towards that location. The group saw her action and took off after her.</p>
<p>There stood a Moebius whom just killed one of the soldiers as Eunie first arrived, followed by the rest. It turned around to reveal the death of a soldier. Borealis recognized the corpse, "<strong>ORSOLYA!!!</strong>" The Moebius swung Orsolya's corpse at them, whom dropped in front of them.{{footnote: Behind stood a giant tree trunk so big we could call it Yggdrasil, or The World Tree.}}</p>
<p>A moebius with butterfly  teleported and entered the scene, "You dolt." She held a long scepter and joined beside the other Moebius, didn't transform herself. "You killed her... I wish I'd known you were paying a visit! I'd have found a much more practical use for this thing."</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Y-you're...</strong>"{{footnote: Because we put this scene before 'the event', the speech is different if you watched the first video. The difference is: "Y-you're... X!" and she replied, "Been a while, friends."  That's basically the only difference.}}</p>
<p>"Eheheh... You can call me X." She took off her helmet and revealed her face. White short hair, a purple scar that scratch from the right of her chin through her nose on to her forehead. Sharp eyebrows with crimson iris. There was a butterfly that emits energy attached to the left of her hair. "And this is... Well, <em>he's just some underling so I don't actually care</em>." Can't actually recognize whoever that Moebius is, eh! And that guy didn't reply either. Elatedly, she continued, "<strong>Anyway, I count myself lucky!</strong> I mean, you popping up <em>while we render judgment</em>!"</p>
<p>Noah: "A judgment, is it?"</p>
<p>X was surprised, "<strong>Oh?</strong> Did they actually work it out?"</p>
<p>"'Work it out'?" What does she even mean?</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, what, you didn't?</strong> Way to get my hopes up... I thought you came <em>because you worked out what's going on with the colony ranks.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie shot back, her curiosity piqued, "With the ranks?"</p>
<p>"Yes. <em>The ranks.</em> You've been so desperate to raise them. Just for a bit of comfort, you snatched away the lives of your enemies."</p>
<p>Lanz impatiently asked for speeding up, "Are you gonna get to your point? <strong>Come on!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>UUURRRRGGGHHH!!!</strong>" She can't stand him cutting her off, or maybe, still couldn't figure it out. "<strong>Are you some kind of idiot?</strong> I mean I've laid it all out for you! Just think a minute, it'll come to you!"</p>
<p>"<strong>SNUFF OFF!!!</strong>" Sorry, a big brainer only useful for fighting isn't useful for figuring out puzzles. Actually, not even Taion cut her, hadn't figured it out yet, perhaps?</p>
<p>"Huuuuhhhhhh.... I'll make it so you dopes can understand. <em>Are you ready</em>? Taking notes? It was <strong>us</strong> <em>who made up all the colony ranks</em>. Good old Moebius." And she showed her Moebius Iris. Sounds shocking to the group, for whatever reasonings. Perhaps confined within the box?</p>
<p>"Whuh!?"</p>
<p>"First, we have the <em>lowly Dirt</em>, then there's Tin. Tins go up to Copper. Then you get Iron. After that comes Steel. Then you get the badass Silver. And finally..." She looked at the Flame Clock, continued, "you've hit the top, <em>Gold</em>." With extreme elation, "<strong>You've been falling over each other, trying to kill each other day by day.</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio tried to strike forward hearing how she could be so happy to see them die in the millions.</p>
<p>Eunie desperately questioned, "<strong>BUT WHY?! WHAT DID YOU EVEN MAKE THE RANKS FOR?!</strong>"</p>
<p>That's the face she wanted to see! "Because... <em>What else is gonna motivate you? Eh?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>WHAT?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You humans... You need some kind of goal in your little lives. You want to give your Blades an upgrade, you want to eat some nice food... or you want to <em>live longer</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>YOU EVIL...</strong>"</p>
<p>"All we did was give you those goals. And while you're trying to rise up, <strong>your life force grows brighter! So shiny! Isn't it wonderful? But then, once you've reached the top,</strong> there's nowhere to go but down. And that's no good, is it? <strong>Then it's harvest time. One last gasp of defiance...!</strong> Then we take what's stored up at your life's end."</p>
<p>Eunie were already looking down on the floor, trying to compress her anger as she heard her words. Taion kept his cool, summarized, "So then... you're saying the Gold rank's nothing but a sham?"</p>
<p>"<em>I just told you, it's to motivate you.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie, with clenched fist and volcano at its edge of erupting, "<em>Oh yeah, you motivated us real good</em>... You've forced us to fight... without ever knowing the truth...!"</p>
<p>What the heck does she think she's talking about, "<strong>Huh? What are you even-?!</strong> You've done a good job tearing the place up yourselves!" As if motivation meant free from their control, but rather their own will, it seems to her. "<em>Nobody's ever forced you to do anything</em>. <strong>You guys</strong>, <em>you like a spot of murder as much as anyone</em>!"</p>
<p>"<strong>There's nothing to like about it! How could anyone like it? We live in fear, knowing nothing but fighting... We wanted to reach Gold... so we WOULDN'T have to fight... But you...</strong>" All the while X smiled as she heard her, elated that she get what the Moebius's wanted. Eunie's fist was clenching so tightly it quivered, "<strong>You took even that from us!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Because you're idiots, surely? Just think about it real hard for one second. Who gave up the right to think for themselves? You did."</p>
<p>Lanz: "what a load of <strong>CRAP! You're the ones who never left us any room to think about our actions!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You haven't got two neurons in your heads. <em>All you have are the things we gave you,</em> and you have the gall to complain?" And she made this sound what's called 'blows a raspberry' (Boob boob, by sticking your lips together and blew air against it so it sounded like farting twice).</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>ARSEHOLE...! YOU AIN'T GETTIN' AWAY WITH THIS! HOW CAN OUR LIVES MEAN SO SNUFFIN' LITTLE TO YOU?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Riku warned, "<strong>Eunie! She just goading Eunie to make feathers ruffled. Keep head frosty!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>BUT SHE'S...</strong>"</p>
<p>He cut her off, whatever her assumptions and reasonings, cut straight to the root, "<strong>False. She scared of Ouroboros. She want mistake-making so she can give friend the finisher!</strong>"</p>
<p>Her tone calmed down, questioned, "You think she's... scared?" Turning to her, she tried to notice any micro emotions in X.</p>
<p>X heard him all along, only started to took notice of him, "<strong>You</strong>... Smart cookie, aren't you? I was told... Nopon aren't supposed to interfere. Maybe they were wrong. Well, whatever. It messes up my plans <em>just a little</em>..." and she put her mask back, summoned her scepter, and continued "but I think it's about harvest time. I'll take... <strong>every last spark!</strong>" The Moebius underling (Moebius L) at the back joined in.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the fight. Moebius L fell to the ground, dissipated into blue motes as his core broke.</p>
<p>X calmly spoke, as if the underling that died is none of her business, "I think you're starting to get the hang of this! Killing Moebius and all..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Cheers for the compliment. But I'll tell you one thing... <em>I ain't doin' this because I like it.</em> <strong>I'm just doing this to survive.</strong>"</p>
<p>"You don't change. You're still just a grunt." Removing her mask, she continued, "You're desperate to kill, just 'cause you're afraid of dying."</p>
<p>"<em>That's where you're wrong.</em>" Holding up her blades and signaling to it, "This... isn't just for me any more. A lot of people's hopes... are riding on this! <strong>So now, I ain't afraid. I'll carry these hopes as far as I can, until we've made the world how it SHOULD BE!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh? Well said. All right. <em>How far can you take this? Guess I'll wait and see.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>OOOHHH, LOOK. Just can't wait to escape, can you?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Eheheh <strong>Well of course!</strong> I'm a busy girl after all! <em>Can't spend</em> all my time playing with you. <strong>Buh-bye!</strong>" And she vanished into thin air, teleported away. The group therefore sheathed their blades as danger disappeared.</p>
<p>Eunie felt the stone crushing on her heart, breathed heavily.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of the cave by the grassy patch beside the road. Mio, Sena, and Manana chatting in one subgroup, Eunie talking to Taion, Riku to Lanz, and Noah and Bolearis looked at the others. The injured Kevesi soldiers were no longer seen.</p>
<p>"Uh-huh..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"What's it all been for, eh? <em>All of our fighting...</em> We struggle on, and on... But at the end of the day it never ends." As they were speaking, the group stopped talking and turned their attention to the two, something more interesting than their small talk, perhaps.</p>
<p>"As long as we live, all we can do is fight on. <em>That's not going to change.</em>"</p>
<p>"You're saying there's no escape?"</p>
<p>"Depends how you look at it. Sourcing ingredients and growing crops... You'd call doing those things a struggle, wouldn't you?"</p>
<p>"Pfft... <em>You say some weird stuff</em>."</p>
<p>"Fight, struggle, they're just words. <strong><em>And what's important, is not the words. It's what you do.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie agreed, "Innit. <em>What's inside's the most important thing.</em> You know, I think I'm starting to get it. I've got you, Ethel, <em>and all the others to thank for it.</em>"</p>
<p>Bolearis questioned, "So... you're not afraid any more, then."</p>
<p>Taion took to her stead, "We're the same as everyone else. We're not perfect. <strong>Even now, we still feel fear</strong> from moment to moment."</p>
<p>"And still... you'll go on?"</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, "Yeah. We want to make sure we'll... walk the path we want to. Just like... Ethel... once did."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed with her. "No matter where it goes. Right?" The misty fog shrouded the distant view of the dilapidated buildings. The spooky lack of light and animals woo-ing paved their way for a brighter future. Even if you can't see where you go, to keep moving on is all we could do.</p>

<p>Returning to their dorm, the kids playing by the grassy park, under the tree, caught Lanz's eyes. They gathered in a circle with one kid meddling with a puppet.</p>
<p>"There. All done!" It's a wooden figure, a guy holding a sword, probably he carved. He stood up and handed them to the two boys, excited.</p>
<p>"Wow! Amazing!" He did it for him. He took it from his hands gently and dashed off into the distance, the young girl following after him. Another young girl was gathering grass alone in the background.</p>
<p>"'Kay, I'll bagsie the next one! I even brought the materials an' stuff. Make me something mega cool, yeah?" The other boy requested for his puppet figure. All the while, Noah stood beside Lanz, both watching them play. The others entered the lodge.</p>
<p>"Sure. What kinda Blade do you want? Sword? Gun?" We saw the girl chasing after the boy whom held the puppet high up as he ran around the grassy park.</p>
<p>"Fist."</p>
<p>"Okey dokey."</p>
<p>Lanz called out, "Hey."</p>
<p>"Mm?" He turned to look at him.</p>
<p>"If we didn't have to fight each other... you think.. that could have been Joran?"</p>
<h4 id="start-of-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-2">Start of Memories</a></h4>
<p>Joran was meddling with something by (his?) bed as the three entered their barracks, Lanz calling out, "Joran! Didja ditch training again, just to work on this stuff?"</p>
<p>"Did not! I'm not skiving!" He was using a carving knife to carve something. He continued his carving with attention, didn't lay their eyes on them, while explaining himself away, "I just... had a bad headache. I gave notice, too..."</p>
<p>Eunie couldn't believe her ears: "'Scuse me? Noah did that for you. Right?"</p>
<p>He just laughed it off, "Huh huh, err, I'm used to doing it."</p>
<p>"OK, it's done!" Joran held it out and the others bent closer to peer at it.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Hold on! Isn't that..."</p>
<p>"Ahahahah..." He tucked it to the side of his belt. There were already 3 figurines hanging on it, all wearing war suits, one male with gray spiky hair, a female with short blond hair and wings on her head, and the last with dark hair and a strand of hair slicing through between his eyes, its ends on the side of his nose.</p>
<p>Eunie asked, "Who's that? Lanz?"</p>
<p>"This one's Eunie... and, this is Noah."</p>
<p>Eunie was impressed! "Hey! That looks just like me! Good job, matey!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Huuuh...?"</p>
<p>Noah gave praise readily, "I love it, Joran!"</p>
<p>"Uh? Yeah...?"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" He nodded with confirmation. "We don't have your talent. All we can do... is slash and shoot each other... But you create things!"</p>
<p>"Hahaha..." He was humble to hear it.</p>
<p>Lanz broke into their conversation, asking, "Hey! So who's this?" Joran looked down at the last figure, the one wearing red striped shirt, thick hair that covered both side of his eyes. "We know someone like that?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Look like a real tough fella."</p>
<p>In an embarrassing and awkward tone, "Umm, that's... Err... It's me..."</p>
<p>Both (except Noah) in unison{{footnote: Seemingly Noah didn't readily judge him as Lanz and Eunie did.}}, "Whaaattt???!!!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "This <em>is</em> you?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "It looks nothin' like you!"</p>
<p>"M...mm... Yeah... But, like... That's what I wanna end up like, someday. Haha... Silly, huh?"</p>
<p>Noah rebutted, "It's not silly! I believe in you. I've seen exactly what you can do!"</p>
<p>Lanz disagreed, "You think <em>he's</em> got what it takes? <em>You're talking out your bum</em>."</p>
<p>"No, I'm not! He can do it! Right, Joran?"</p>
<p>"Uh... Uh... I'll... try, then. I'll... try really hard!" His tone grew anxious as he isn't sure if he can meet his expectations. Noah nodded back at him. The others mentioned nothing to disappoint him.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-2">End of memories</a></h4>
<p>Lanz, in a regretful tone, "He looked up to me, man... Smiling..."</p>
<p>"Sometimes it's hard to judge, huh? What we're supposed to be protecting. It all gets a bit blurry."</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>"Even so... His smile... was the real thing. We should cherish that."{{footnote: The kids now gathered back in a group to see him making the new puppet.}}</p>
<p>He resignedly sighed. Then, he looked at his hand for a while, until Noah held out his fist straight to him. He turned to meet his eyes, and Noah continued, "Next time, we'll think twice. About... who really needs punching." He withdrew his fist from him.</p>
<p>Lanz looked down at his fist once more, closed his eyes, agreed, "Yeah... <strong>Yeah</strong>... I hear you." Noah held out his fist once more; this time, Lanz punched back, and their fist met, a sign of agreement.</p>
<hr />
<p>Looking up at the candle-lit metallic roof, Eunie, lying on her bed, eyes stay opened while others had dozed off. With lingering thoughts that forced her not to sleep, she sat up and climbed down the two-layer bunker bed ladder, went outside the dorm, and paid the growth modules room another visit. Focusing her vision on the unconscious Ethel, the evidence that reminded of <em>her</em> husk on the battlefield, <em>her</em> dog tag with <em>her</em> name on it that she retrieved it from <em>her</em> husk's chest.</p>
<p>"So you saw it."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Your husk. Your own lifeless husk. You've come across it?" Such mind-reading ability from Monica. Or maybe, Eunie wasn't the only one...</p>
<p>"How did you...?"</p>
<p>"Your eyes... You looked like you were gazing into your own past."</p>
<p>A moment of digestion before she replied, "That's crazy. Live long enough, and you learn how to figure out stuff like that?"</p>
<p>"Oh, it hasn't been as long as you think. But, folk do tell me I'm pretty sharp."</p>
<p>"Hah. That all?" Monica walked up and stood beside Eunie; they turned their gaze at the growth modules. "How come you don't wake these guys up? Couldn't you use the help? Or is it... 'cause they'd just be Moebius fodder?"</p>
<p>"They can't be fodder. If we wake 'em up here, they'll be freed from the shackles of the Flame Clock."</p>
<p>"So, why then?"</p>
<p>"Because this is <em>our</em> fight. We don't know how long it'll take. And their lives are short."</p>
<p>"So you don't wanna get 'em mixed up in everything?"</p>
<p>She snorted at the hypothesis, "That's one reason."</p>
<p>"And... the other?"</p>
<p>"People need to learn who they really are. What they have to leave behind for posterity. I want them to wake up in a world... that affords them that chance."</p>
<p>Eunie looked away, asked quietly, "How do we discover who we really are...?" She held the dog tag on her palm, peering at it.</p>
<p>"That from the husk?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"You won't find yourself there."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You've gotta look to the present and the future only. The one in the past -- it isn't <em>'you'</em>. You didn't make that and it's not yours."</p>
<p>Confused, "Make that...?"</p>
<p>"But... look to the future, and you can build yourself up however you like. <strong>You can become whoever you wanna be</strong>."</p>
<p>"I can...?"</p>
<p>"You've got the power to do so. Be true to yourself."</p>
<p>"Thank you, that's..."</p>
<p>Monica turned away from her thanks, explained, "Well... That's what my dad always said."</p>
<p>"Your 'dad'...?"</p>
<p>"Mm... But it goes for you, too." Then, she walked towards the entrance as she finished her sentence.</p>
<p>She watched her leaving, trying to internalize what she passed on, "True to myself... We'll see." She took a last look at the dog tag, clenched it within her fist, her heart knot{{footnote: Direct translated from Chinese: 心结, which one isn't sure what it's called in English.}} untangled.</p>
<hr />
<p>Next morning. Mio was doing the cooking in the park square alone, stirring soup on a stove placed on top of a table. She took a ladle from the steaming soup, forcefully blew into it for a few times, before taking a taste. "Mm... Ahh!" The content was too hot, she squinted to soothe her pain.</p>
<p>"<strong>HAH, REALLY?!!!</strong> Did you seriously just burn your tongue again?" Lanz cheerily called out, walking up to her and earned her attention. The others seemed to not be around.</p>
<p>"Uh... Haha... Ah, you saw that?"</p>
<p>"Well, your soup <em>is</em> one of the highlights of my day."</p>
<p>"<strong>Really?!</strong>" That was surprising to hear. "Whoa, thanks! I'm flattered."</p>
<p>"It was just the truth..."</p>
<p>"Uhm... Want some? To taste-test?" Now that she had a better tongue, eh?</p>
<p>His eyes lit up, "For real?! Good thing I got up early!" She poured him a cup of it. He took it in his hand, continued the conversation while waiting for the heat to dissipate. Or maybe, he's just interested to know more about her.</p>
<p>"You enjoy cooking?"</p>
<p>She continued stirring the pot of soup, her eyes on it, while replying, "Oh, it's been drilled into me. It's a ritual now. Can't really start the day without making a pot."</p>
<p>"I get ya. Two months, huh? Since that battle..."</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>"You're tough. No joke."</p>
<p>"Eh?" She turned to him at such comment, surprised by the adjective he used.</p>
<p>"We heard, from Eunie. That you're just like us."</p>
<p>"Oh. That part."{{footnote: Bright fig, Miyabi, if you didn't already got it.}}</p>
<p>"I've been plodding along, playing it all cool... But when we saw <em>him</em> again, I thought... Nah, snuff <strong>all</strong> of this."</p>
<p>"I'm scared too... Just so you know." In her appreciation stance, "Since Monica told us the whole truth... I've hoped... No..." She shook her head, "I'm sure I'll see Miyabi again. <strong>I'm so sure of it.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hard, wasn't it? Hearing that."</p>
<p>"Yeah. But... It sure beats ignorance."</p>
<p>"That's what Noah thinks too. You're hard as nails."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>What we don't know, might as well not exist... It's an obvious way to think, but it isn't right.</em></strong> Closing my eyes doesn't mean evil disappears."</p>
<p>"And so... You go on?"</p>
<p>Nodding, "Yeah. I'll keep going, <em>while my flame still flickers... to the bitter end. With all of you</em>."</p>
<p>He closed his eyes a moment, turned away from her, and opened looking down, "You said it." He finally emptied her soup in his cup.</p>
<hr />
<p>The others had already gathered outside the dorm as Mio and Lanz joined in. Upon arrival, Lanz immediately asked, "Did we hear from Monica?"</p>
<p>Noah replied, "Yeah. The ship's ready."</p>
<p>Mio: "Mr. Samon must have pulled an all-nighter."</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's all going to kick off soon."</p>
<p>Taion: "Our preparations should also be complete. Let's rendezvous with Mr. Samon at the port."</p>
<p>Mio nodded, "Let's."</p>
<hr />
<p>They arrived beside the ship. Mr. Samon and the Ouroboros candidate plus Monica already waiting there. Samon called out,  "I been waiting for you! Ship is steady-ready."</p>
<p>Monica: "OK, I'm counting on you to bust out and bring back Ghondor."</p>
<p>Eunie didn't understood, "You're counting on us? Count on yourself -- you're coming too, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"This isn't the Lost Numbers' only job right now, you know." Turning to one of the guy, "Jansen, you're in charge of the infiltration."</p>
<p>"Understood." Jansen turned to the group, "Try not to drag us down, Ouroboros."</p>
<p>Lanz threw his hands into the air, still don't like their manners, "Worry about yourself!"</p>
<p>Monica just shook her head, refused to mediate for such small matters, "Samon, tell us the route."</p>
<p>Suddenly put under the spotlight while busy listening, his thought gathered slow, "Meh! Me-hem! As said before, you cross along Erythia Sea on good ship Boundary, then go to prison direct underneath Castle."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Ah, good. Right through the fog."</p>
<p>"But! Here is detail of importance. Even if all get there without bumps and bruises, island is surrounded by tall cliff on all side! Boundary only run over water... After that, friends will need proceed under own strength."</p>
<p>Sena: "So we just have to do our best to climb up the cliffs without getting rumbled?"</p>
<p>Taion was imagining the cliff might be higher than they could muster: "If we can climb up them just by doing our best then that's great, but..."</p>
<p>Monica agreed, "First, it can't be done."</p>
<p>Mio shared, "If the prison's in Agnus Castle, then it's going to be more heavily guarded than any old Colony."</p>
<p>"Right on the money. Before you head for the prison, rendezvous with a soldier hiding on nearby Vinisog Holm. Her name's Kisame. She's the only soldier who managed to escape from Hope's Rest."</p>
<p>Taion hypothesized, "If we learn about how she managed to escape, we can use that information in our infiltration, is that right?"</p>
<p>Monica didn't reply to him directly, "Vinisog Holm is on the way anyway, so rather than fiddle with janky comms, I thought it'd be best to go there and chat."</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah, makes sense."</p>
<p>"That's all I've got to say. Get everything ready for departure."</p>
<p>"OK."</p>
<p>"All righty-doodles, goodest of luck to friends."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Wait, are you not piloting us, Mr. Samon?"</p>
<p>"Samon is tired after long night of work. Please to not overwork poor Samon."</p>
<p>Mio: "So who is our pilot, then...?"</p>
<p>"Pilot is inside you all along! Samon can send information of direction to any Iris, so anyone who want to pilot can fulfill dream." Huh, a secret friend in the team?{{footnote: Yes, a secret friend for real. Look out for the 'hammer'!!!}} But however, if break Boundary, is punishable by <strong>megaspankings.</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, yeah, we get it."</p>
<p>Riku took out his comms and checked the information Samon sent before tucking it back into his pocket. "...Fine, fine, Riku will volunteer for pilot."</p>
<p>Noah: "Is that OK?"</p>
<p>"Is easier than working Levnis."</p>
<p>Noah turned to the candidates group to explain, "Riku was our mechanic back in the colony. He's good with stuff like this. I trust him to lead us right."</p>
<p>Jansen: "Sure it'll be fine."</p>
<p>Manana fluttered, "Will do our best!"</p>
<p>Noah: "This Ghondor person in prison is our key to finding the whereabouts of the true Queens."</p>
<p>Mio: "We have to pull this off."</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Island small enough only to build a lighthouse on top of it. More smaller ones cannot even support buildings of large. Sandy beaches barely emerged between these sharp rocks piercing up into the sky. Larger island could be seen elsewhere. The inaccessible island shaped like thorns carpeted with yellow grass and some bushes, or maybe trees, marked the boundaries of the sea. Plants so huge they tangled from the lower part of the island to the upper portion. Some species had their leaves shaped like peas, single branch, emanating green luminosity. Dolphins with lanterns on their antennas swam in a shoal. Above all, the floating fish we saw in the desert{{footnote: Danagh Desert and probably another place, one can't remember.}} patrolled their territory. Where inaccesible island don't bordered was a waterfall, where water fall 85° straight down into an abyss so deep; which they called it the Vortex. We could see the Agnus Castle floating on the opposite side, above one of the boundaries on the sea. This, is <strong>Erythia Sea</strong>, of Cadensia Region.</p>

<hr />
<p>The group walked up to the bonfire set under the double-layer island; a dome shielded it from the scorching sun in the day. There were barricades and supplies and tables and chair set up to one side of the bonfire. Looking around, they found no one. "Hm..."</p>
<p>Sena: "...There's nobody here?"</p>
<p>Manana: "Puzzles..."</p>
<p>"This is definitely the rendezvous point." Jansen confirmed. "You guys take a load off. I'll take a look around."</p>
<p>Noah: "Sure thing." Then, Jansen walked away himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group separately gathered into their own sub-groups. The Ouroboros camped beside the bonfire, the candidates nearer to the tables and barricades. Shania was on the watch, not even joining her group. Lanz and Sena were doing pushups. Riku and Manana, Eunie and Noah, both having conversations one-to-one. The evening sun that penetrates the hole on top of the dome caressed the sandy floor.</p>
<p>Mio and Taion took steps toward one edge of the island, outside the dome's shield, scanning the vast blue that stretches into the horizon.</p>
<p>"Mmm... Ahh! It's gorgeous... I can hardly believe my eyes. Is this real?" The various island of various shapes in the distance; not even the thin black fog can shroud the distant view. The Agnus Castle floated in front of them, far in the horizon. The waves, surprisingly, did not beat against the edge of the rock, as if they pull back on time before it could make contact.</p>
<p>"We don't wage many battles at sea, so... makes sense the seas would be relatively untouched."</p>
<p>"Aha..."  Too logical.</p>
<p>"When people do die at sea, it's usually due to their Ferronis sinking... They drown. It's hard to draw out their life with a Blade. Putting it that way... I guess it's kinda <em>obvious</em>, huh?"</p>
<p>"A little ironic. That that's why it still looks... so pristine."</p>
<p>Changing the focus, "The other half of my reason..."</p>
<p>"Oh? Are we talking about that now?" It's not that long for her to forget, since leaving Colony Lambda.</p>
<p>"About why I'm here, yes." Now that he was ready. "<em>Right</em>? I told you there was a second half."</p>
<p>"Mm...?" She nudged him to go ahead.</p>
<p>"<em>It's you, Mio.</em>"</p>
<p>Her eyebrow shot up, "Me? What do you-?"</p>
<p>He didn't gave her long to finish her sentence, "You want to leave an impression." She blinked her eyes quickly twice, peering at him, as he continued, "On all of us, and the world. Don't you?" He turned to join eye contact with her.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." She turned away to look at the sea.</p>
<p>"I can only hazard a guess at what you'd want it to be... And even then I'm not confident I'd guess right... But... let me just say this: You've only got... a little over a month left. We can't change that fact. It doesn't give you much time to leave your mark."</p>
<p>"Hmph..." Her eyes dreary with tears, she looked down at the disappointing fact so clearly laid out.</p>
<p>"If... there were anything I could do to give you time... If it were in my power, I would!" He turned to look at her, "Not just me! Sena, too! And Noah. We all think that way."</p>
<p>She turned away from him to wipe his teary eyes, "Mio?"</p>
<p>"Sparks! <em>You're making me tear up here, man.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh uh... sorry. That wasn't my intention!"</p>
<p>"No. Thank you. Nimue's doing?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"You were even being nice to Eunie. Stuff like that."</p>
<p>"Oh... oh, really?" Feeling awkward, he went on to scratch his head. "I'd never even thought about it."</p>
<p>"Let's give thanks, if we ever see one of those trees of hers."</p>
<p>"A Saffronia? Right... I think that's a great idea." Together, they peered at the moving clouds, the breezy wind that moves it, and time moving, as they put a stop on the topic.</p>
<hr />
<p>Mio and Taion rejoined the two groups that had gathered in front of Jansen and another woman, with Jansen speaking, "Everyone's here. Good."</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "Is this the person that made it out of the prison camp, then?"</p>
<p>"Kisame." A short dark hair woman that seems as tough and manly as a stereotypical man.</p>
<p>Jansen turned to her, "Right, sorry to rush you but can you tell us about the camp?"</p>
<p>Without objections, "I can. Let's see now... Inside the camp, every prisoner is tracked using identification devices. You need those devices to move around the grounds. But if you go anywhere you're not supposed to, they'll trip the alarm and the guards will come running."</p>
<p>Eunie folded her arms, "So you can't go anywhere without 'em, but they stop you escaping? Crafty so-and-sos..."</p>
<p>Noah: "So, how did you manage to escape?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, "I'll be honest, most of it was sheer luck. I was working by the western gate, when I happened to notice that there were fewer guards than normal... I asked my mates to help, and we got me out, alone." She lowered her head as the pain ruptured her feelings; they most probably had sacrificed.</p>
<p>Taion left her emotions unattended, "In other words, it wouldn't be feasible for us to infiltrate by the same route you used to leave."</p>
<p>"I imagine it wouldn't, no."</p>
<p>Lanz plainly suggested, "In that case, why not drop the sneaky stuff and just get caught on purpose?"</p>
<p>Jansen rebutted, "If the guards figure out you're Ouroboros, the plan's gonna fall to pieces. They'll just kill you right then and there. At least until you can get information out of Ghondor on the inside... you can't let the Agnians know that you're Ouroboros."</p>
<p>"Hrm..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Right, so we're saying stealth's the only way to get everyone out safely, Ghondor included."</p>
<p>Kisame: "Since you've mentioned Ghondor... We used to gather in the central cell block for morning assembly, so it should be easy to make contact, provided you can get in."</p>
<p>Jansen appreciated, "Good info, thanks. I suppose we'll need more data points on the prison if we're to figure out a way of infiltrating it."</p>
<p>"I figured you might say that, so I got busy while I waited here, observing Agnian troops. Seems to me you might have more luck getting information from them, seeing as how I only saw one part of the prison..."</p>
<p>There was a huge island, tall rocks that crafted multiple layers, that stood near the vortex. Plants with their leaves shaped like crystals decorated the island. Kisame commented, "Can you see that island to the northwest? That's Corne Island. I saw the Agnian transport Balaena heading that way. It's most likely a Levnis from the Castle, so if you can access a terminal or something, you might be able to learn a thing or two?"</p>
<p>Another island; perhaps nearer to the middle of the sea. It was also a huge island, but only a single layer; the upper layers were inaccessible, overgrown with trees with red leaves. Connecting to the roads onto a higher ground by a bridge was a stronghold with a lighthouse installation, and a building beside it. The sides were unclimbable theoretically, not to say they built walls all round the edges; so the bridge is the only means of access. "And then, there's Turbin Island, to the northeast. It has the Erythia Relay Base on it, permanent garrison and all, so you won't have trouble finding information there."</p>
<p>Behind Turbin island was another island that had a spider-web dome in the middle of the sandy beach, perhaps as large as Turbin island.</p>
<p>Taion assessed the situation, "It sounds like we'll have to accept a certain level of risk, since there is no other way."</p>
<p>Eunie was optimistic, "We just want the info, right? We can slip in and out without getting caught, quick as you like."</p>
<p>"Yes, I <em>would</em> like that, but how likely does it sound...?"</p>
<p>Mio: "More data on the prison is important, sure, but it won't mean much if we don't figure out how to circumvent the ID devices..."</p>
<p>Kisame: "Here, you can use this." She took it out and handed to them, "This is the device they'd put on me." It's only singular, which she handed to Jansen. Turning to the others, "And these... These are the ones from my friends who died in the camp...{{footnote: As if they never cancelled the tag's accessibility.}} Should be enough for all of you, and then some."</p>
<p>Jansen: "Thanks, we appreciate it."</p>
<p>Kryto: "Jansen?" He is the guy whom said the Ouroboros <em>stole</em> Ouroboros from them. "About those ID devices. Mind letting me have a crack? I think I can pull the warning systems out of 'em. And since you need a few, I'd like to borrow Nissick."</p>
<p>"Understood, thank you. So, with the devices in Kryto's hands..."</p>
<p>Turning to Noah and the group, Noah acknowledged, "We'll see what we can find on Corne Island and Thurbin Island."</p>
<hr />
<p>A large transporting Agnian ship parked on the coast beside a small beach. The group, including the candidates, stood on the grassy area overlooking it. Noah questioned, "OK, now... How do we get closer to the Balaena...?"</p>
<p>No worries. They were already spotted. The Balaena deployed at least two levnises at them. Eunie: "Queen's ruffles...!"</p>
<p>Sena: "We got found..."</p>
<p>Jansen: "Wipe 'em out." They drew their blades for a fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the battle. Still on guard, Noah prompted, "No more enemies...?" Sheathing their blades after confirmation, Noah turned to the others and said, "Good. Let's check inside the ship."</p>
<p>Mio suggested: "I think some of us should stand guard outside."</p>
<p>Lanz volunteered, "All right, I'll be the lookout."</p>
<p>Sena excitedly seconded, "Me too!"</p>
<p>Corne island has some grassy fields and short slope. On the upper area stood some pillars of rocks and weird-growing plants shaping like cocoon, and is that some rainbow crystals or plants sticking to the rocks?</p>
<hr />
<p>While Sena were doing squats on the grassy area with no others in sight, hands behind her head, Shania approached her with questions, "So, Ouroboros does training as well, huh?"</p>
<p>She stopped and turned to her, "You're... Uhh..."</p>
<p>Stopping about 4 to 5 arm-length distance (about 3 meters) facing Sena, she reintroduce herself "Shania. Shania Reid. About your rescue mission. Ghondor and I are friends from the crib."</p>
<p>Curiously, she asked, "I don't know that word, 'crib'... Does it mean you've known each other for a while?"</p>
<p>"I guess you don't use that expression, huh? Why even use words? Feels like we're just talking at cross purposes." Her friendly tone ignites a furious remark. Shania could not help but see a neutral tone as an aggressive ones, targeted to belittle her; or maybe she's just impatience and jealous. She had no intention of providing a definition to satisfy her curiosity.</p>
<p>"Uh... Sorry about that."</p>
<p>"Uh... Know what, forget it. Well? Gonna answer my question?"</p>
<p>"You mean, about training?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"That's the thing... Mimi and the others are doing their best. I need to as well. Anything to help me get an edge. So..."</p>
<p>"<em>Aaahhh</em>... 'Mimi' is it? That's what you call her? The one with the long ears?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. We've always been in the same colony."</p>
<p>"You're friends?" From Translator's perspective, she seems indirectly trying to check for similarity between herself and Sena.</p>
<p>"That might be saying a lot... She's kinda like my role model. She's strong, kind, mega-dependable..."</p>
<h5 id="start-of-memories-3"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-3">Start of Memories</a></h5>
<p>Soldiers chatting with each other, or just traversing to their destination, in the training camp. Sena, her back laid on the diamond-grid fence, sat with legs pulled up, arms gently put on her ankle, looking down and lonely. She might have thought this will stay forever, until Mio's voice sounded, "You're... Sena, right?"</p>
<p>She took a second to figure out someone was calling her unexpectedly, "<strong>Huh?</strong> Oh... It's... You are..."</p>
<p>"I'm Mio, third term. We... haven't met before... have we?" Despite they're expected to be age 13{{footnote: Assuming when they're zeroth term, they're age 10, so they die by age 20. That's an assumption that Translator took, but different people might give a different range, maybe 12 to 22, or 13 to 23.}}, they looked the same in their final and penultimate term, no change in body features nor facial appearances,unlike Eunie and the others which clearly looked different when they were children.</p>
<p>Excited tone to conceal her nervousness and awkwardness, she excitedly stood up, all the while replying, "Ahh, I'm sorry....! Your name totally slipped my mind! But... I don't think... we've talked before...? Uh... Uhm..." She was acting shy.</p>
<p>"You know, I was just looking for a training partner."</p>
<p>"For the trial...?"</p>
<p>"I like to think I'm pretty quick on my feet, but... I'm not really... strong enough. Our captain... said <em>you</em> would make a good addition. And that you're super strong!"</p>
<p>Shaking and scratching her head, she humbly replied, "Hehehe... He's exaggerating. I'm totally average. Totally."</p>
<p>She invited anyways, "Wanna try? Teaming up?"</p>
<p>"With you?" To which she nodded, putting up a smile.</p>
<p>She don't have the confidence, "You sure? I'm a nobody..."</p>
<p>"Sure I'm sure, I'm literally asking you right now. It's your choice."</p>
<p>She thought for a while before replying, "Well... If you really don't mind... Sure." Sena didn't even raise her head to look at her.</p>
<p>"<strong>Really? Golden! We're a team then!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Mmm... <strong>Thank you!</strong>" They continued their conversation thereafter.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-memories-3"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-3">End of Memories</a></h5>
<p>Sena was smiling at her recall.</p>
<p>"Role model, huh." Shania folded her arms, the sourness of jealousy on the verge of explosion.</p>
<p>"She's the one who's kept me going. I wouldn't be here otherwise. And after meeting you guys... now I understand what life's really all about. A part of nature's cycle. I'd never even thought about it before, but... <em>it's pretty amazing, huh?</em>{{footnote: Happy tone.}}"</p>
<p>"<strong>HOW IS IT NATURAL??!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" She didn't get why Shania suddenly got angry.</p>
<p>"<strong>Why should we swing our Blades around without a hope of winning? Better to die, and be born again inside their cycle.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh..." She was shocked by her philosophy.</p>
<p>As if to not kept her lingering on it, she changed to a joking tone and smiling face immediately, "Just pullin' your leg. Caught you off guard?" It's not the time yet... Not the time to let the others know yet...</p>
<p>"Haha... <em>Well, yeah, you kinda did!</em> How'd you expect me to react to that?"</p>
<p>"Hahaha..."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, "Hehehe... Hehehe..."</p>
<p>Back to her serious tone, "Hey. Do you <em>always</em> work so hard for approval? <em>That fun</em>{{footnote: Quieter tone.}}?"</p>
<p>"Huh? You can... tell...?"</p>
<p>"That's right... 'Cause we're just the same." Then, she turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"Huh" The deep breathe she pushed out from her lungs, she watched her leave without a smile.</p>
<hr />
<p>Near the Balaena. Shania stood on the beach herself, looking at the horizon. Her mind was recalling something else.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After she picked up the eyepatches from Guernica's remains, a female Moebius sounded while her attention absorbed on it, "C'mon now. Be true to yourself." She raised her head in shock, turning around to find the source of the voice. The moebius figure, dimly lit so we can only see its eyes and core, walked towards the defensive Shania.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She clenched her fist, swaying between loyalty and being true to herself. The aurora in the sky she could not notice.</p>
<hr />
<p>The next morning. Taion was speaking to the candidates. Lanz was out there doing squats by himself. Mio was wiping the dishes, Sena stood still accompanying her, looked at her for a moment, then looked back down while she lingered in her thoughts from yesterday. Then, she turned to look at Shania, whom was still standing on the beach herself, facing the same direction.</p>
<p>"Hey, uh... Mimi?"</p>
<p>"What's up? Speak to me."</p>
<p>"Ah...uh...ahuh..." Shook her head for a while, "Uhm... It's uh... Lovely... weather we're having!" She couldn't muster the courage to speak up, perhaps on the weird thought Shania had the day before. She looked up at the sky in the Agnian castle's direction, Mio followed her glance; it was cloudy.</p>
<p>She didn't get the underlying message, of course, "I don't know I'd say 'lovely'... Bit overcast."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, "Ah, -y-you're right! Eheh...Silly clouds! Guess I had my head in 'em. Ahahahah!" Then, she quickly walked away to escape the embarrassment.</p>
<p>Mio watched her leave in awe, "Huh? Hmm... What was that about?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group and the candidates gathered around a bonfire on the grassy patch near the Balaena. Parking on the mouth of the entrance (gulf) was their ship, facing to the vast sea.</p>
<p>Eunie questioned, "So, what's our loot from the Balaena lookin' like? A survey sketch of the Agnus Castle Barbican...? Now we're talkin'!"</p>
<p>Taion seemed to analyzed it before the meeting, "And yet, it doesn't enable us to build a plan on its own. If possible, I'd like us to gather further intelligence before acting."</p>
<p>"Bah... Always with the caution, this bloke."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with Taion, "This time around, we'll need as much caution as we can muster, Eunie. We might be able to find more information at the Erythia Relay Base on Thurbin Island."</p>
<p>Mio nodded, "That's right. Let's follow all the leads we have."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the Erythia Relay Base, Olive manipulated the controls that looked like those on the ships in the 20th century. Though, the screen was a lime green hologram, which even today's technology find it hard to cast such huge screen unless with a projector. On it shows several maps, and she navigated between the different maps.</p>
<p>Olive: "Huh... Not bad, not bad at all." Turning the the groups, she touched her temple, "I've sent the data to your Irises. Give it a look over for me."</p>
<p>Checking the data, Sena questioned, "What's this...? A map of the prison camp?"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, skipping her question for later analysis, "We've got a good deal of info now. Let's go back to Kisame on Vinisog Holm."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathering around a bonfire on Vinisog Holm, Jansen questioned, "OK, tell me what you know."</p>
<p>Olive started, "Let me send you what Taion and I got from analyzing the maps." Both touched their irises.</p>
<p>Taion started explaining, "First, about infiltrating the island itself... It appears that there are natural caverns directly underneath Agnus Castle. If we break through one of the walls, then climb the cliffs, we can avoid most of the guards' attention."</p>
<p>Noah and the others were checking on their irises too, with Noah suggesting, "There should be even less chance of us getting caught if we do it under cover of darkness."</p>
<p>Kisame: "I seem to remember a little inlet near Hykt's Cove. It could be a good place to wait for nightfall."</p>
<p>Taion: "Once we've ascended the cliffside, we can approach the camp from the back. Notice the air vents? I expect one of those is our way in."</p>
<p>Lanz: "That's quite a drop."</p>
<p>Taion nodded, "Indeed. They won't be any use for exfiltration. Those ID devices are certainly going to be a help."</p>
<p>Olive: "Well if they're not and you're spotted, you'll all be rounded up in seconds."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So, assuming we get into the prison, how exactly are we supposed to blend in?"</p>
<p>Kisame: "See how the vents also connect to the central cell block? It should be easy for you to mingle when the prisoners are all in one place for morning assembly."</p>
<p>Olive removed her hold on her temple, "After that, you can move about in the open, calm as you like. As long as you've got an ID device, they won't suspect a thing."</p>
<p>Jansen: "Once you're inside, you should make contact with Ghondor as soon as possible... I've prepared a few possible plans of action for when you're ready to leave the camp. You'll need to change plans as the situation demands. Everyone needs to play their part. If you can get out quietly, head for Patulia Bay, where you'll rendezvous with Kisame. But top priority is breaking out Ghondor. Blast the western gate off, if you must."</p>
<p>The guys agreed to the sound plan. Noah: "Well, it seems like we've got our plan in place."</p>
<p>"Riku roger that. When preparations ready, we take Boundary to Hykt's Cove."</p>
<hr />
<p>The night fall. Starlight pierced through the slightly cloudly sky heavy with black fog. The Castle was close; they were waiting at Hykt's Cove. Lanz and Sena were looking up at it.</p>
<p>"It's massive... That's the Agnian Castle?"</p>
<p>They, of course, weren't the only ones observing. Eunie: "And it's floating..."{{footnote: Remember, Agnian had anti-gravity technology the Kevesi don't; that's why their levnises are floating on balls, while Kevesi was attached to wheels.}}</p>
<p>"Seen it before, Mio?"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "Nope. First time for me too. Unlike you guys, we never got any special training."</p>
<p>"Ah..."</p>
<p>Taion turned their attention to their mission: "If our intel's right... we ought to find a cave if we circle along anticlockwise."</p>
<p>Sena: "Is that the one that then leads to the ventilation ducts in the camp?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right."</p>
<p>Noah: "Quickly. We need to get in, before it gets light."</p>

</blockquote>
<p>At a camp, Lanz started the conversation: "Before, or now... I can't tell which one was tougher..."</p>
<p>Noah: "What is this about?"</p>
<p>"Ah, nothing really, I was just thinking about the training regime those Lost Numbers go through. I hear it's a real gauntlet."</p>
<p>Eunie complemented, "That's how you toughen up, ain't it? Not that I'd wanna sign up, myself."</p>
<p>Mio shared, "Right? Ours wasn't pleasant at all."</p>
<p>"But when it boils down to it, I think it's the trainees who are better off, yeah?"</p>
<p>Taion questioned, "Compared to what we're doing now?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, yeah. Life was a lot easier back when we were new recruits, right?"</p>
<p>"Ah, hm... That does make a kind of sense."</p>
<p>Noah: "All we do these days is fighting, and then more fighting..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you get me?" Lanz felt the synchronization of thoughts!</p>
<p>Sena wondered, "What sort of training d'you think they actually go through?"</p>
<p>Lanz invited her, "You curious too, Sena? You wanna come with? We can check it out together!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, now you're talking! It's always fun to shop around for some new exercises."</p>
<p>Eunie can see the two getting excited, "You lot are really getting into this idea..."</p>
<p>Noah wouldn't deny they fulfill their obsessions/desire, "The training ground should be near the dormitory. I think we spent the night there once."</p>
<p>"Yeah! Let's drop by when we're in the area!"</p>
<hr />
<p>A Ferronis with a row of eyes flaming red; a Flame Clock on its mouth area burning green flames, slightly more than half filled, with two blue rings attached to its 'ears', placed in a room of almost complete darkness, too dark to see any unilluminating features.</p>
<p>A male Moebius walked into the scene, narrated, "So you wish to utilize this <em>thing</em>, of which <em>I meant to dispose... Such daring lunacy</em>... That is what I would dub it."</p>
<p>Another female{{footnote: Sounding old, this voice, actually.}} Moebius sounded, "It would be a dreadful waste to throw it away... There's always a use. Always... People, lives, the lot. Y...?"</p>
<p>"<em>I stand corrected</em>. Then, what manner of use is it that you have envisioned?"</p>
<p>"The Lost Numbers..."</p>
<p>"<strong>The City ruffians?</strong> <em>You do know, no life can be harvested therefrom?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes</strong>, I am aware. That's why I'll have my toy soldiers play a little game. The lives of the fallen will be amassed, in this... special Flame Clock, <strong>as a reward</strong> for the final lass or lad left standing."</p>
<p>"<em>Oho</em>..." That piqued his interest a little, just a little...</p>
<p>"The cream of the crop of youths, competing for glory... Ohhhhh... Is that not simply... sublime?" Then, the Flame Clock glowed bright green and lit the floor in front of it. In front of the Flame Clock stood a winged child, his bodily features looked like... <em>Garvel</em>?</p>
<hr />
<p>In the City. The group watched as the soldiers trained, with swords and shields, with guns, and their instructors stood by the side watching over them. With a thin smile on his face, it triggered his memory.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-lanzs-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-lanzs-memories">Start of Lanz's Memories</a></h4>
<p>"Ehhhh...." Young Lanz was defending against some blow with a frequency shield raised by his broadsword. One-on-one fight, it was Garvel bashing on him. Outside stood the other soldiers, including Noah and the others, watching the fight inside the 'den'.</p>
<p>Panting heavily and rested for a moment, Garvel took another go, dashed towards the tired Lanz. Lanz calculated the moment correctly, slashed his sword out of his hands and brought him on to the ground, sword on his neck. Garvel had lost.</p>
<p>Sheathing his broadsword, he raised his hands up in a clenched fist, signaling his victory.</p>
<hr />
<p>Thereafter, he had a blue sword-crossed medal attached to his chest with Noah, Joran, and Eunie watching; his nose pitched high, signifying excess pride, and enjoying Joran's flattering words. His smiles pitched larger and larger.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-lanzs-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-lanzs-memories">End of Lanz's Memories</a></h4>
<p>No longer did he felt pride; it was long gone. They served the war all right, but not peace. Looking to his right, he saw two Lost Numbers getting lectured by the instructor. Effetely, he started narrating with a down tone,</p>
<p>"Six ain't many..."</p>
<p>Sena didn't get it, "Six of, what now?"</p>
<p>"The Ouroboros candidates. All that training, and six get in."</p>
<p>Eunie recalled: "Oh yeah, Monica did say something like that to us."</p>
<p>"I feel... <em>kinda let down</em>."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Just knowing there's a pecking order here too. Makes 'em the same... Same as us."</p>
<p>Taion: "People aren't equally suited to everything. <strong>Such is life!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sure. I guess, but..."</p>
<p>Eunie, perhaps feeling the conversation to low, cut him off and expressed his thoughts, turning to Taion, "I'm feeling hungry. You guys wanna go grab a bite?"</p>
<p>"I'm in favor."</p>
<p>Sena suggested, "How about the shopping area? I found the <em>tastiest-looking</em> Torpedo stand. How's that sound?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Torpedo wraps</strong>, eh? <strong>Spark yes!</strong> Lanz?" He was still looking attentively at the training squad, lost in his own thoughts.</p>
<p>As he slowly regained attention to the group, he turned slowly to Eunie, "Yeah, sure thing." And she nodded back to him. The group left while he retained for a moment, took a final look at the training squad, unsure what he was thinking about, before joining the group thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway towards their destination, there's someone juggling balls like jokers, up into the air and catch them skillfully. People and Nopon were watching his show by the empty space. Lanz and the others stopped by to look at such event that caught their eyes. They were happy, the juggler was happy.</p>
<p>Suddenly, there's someone shouting, "<strong>Hey, you, what're you doing back here?!</strong>" A 'cop' was running towards the boy while warning, "<strong>How many times have I told you?! No performing out here!</strong>" The rest of the audience quickly dissipated as he arrived; the boy tucked the balls into his pocket. Only the Ouroboros were still watching the scene unfolding and the 'cop' lecturing the kid before going off his way. The kid had a box in front of him, probably to collect money. He just shook his head in disappointment, in a sigh, at what life went at him, the obstacles set before him.</p>
<p>"Hmm..." Lanz being curious, took steps to approach the adolescent-looking guy, immediately lectured, "You shouldn't be wasting your time like this. Don't you have... training?"</p>
<p>The guy turned and saw the buff muscular guy looming on him, rebutted without a tone of anger, nor any of impatience, patiently and calmly spoken, "I'm not wasting my time. This is my job, here." And he took out one of the ball and showed it to Lanz.</p>
<p>"You call that a job?"</p>
<p>"Hey, you're Ouroboros, right? I've heard. I suppose my job doesn't really compare to yours, I'll admit."</p>
<p>Lanz changed the topic on to the cop, "Why're they on your case?"</p>
<p>"Street performance. It's not allowed on this road."</p>
<p>"<strong>Street performance...?</strong>"</p>
<p>He started juggling, ignoring the cop's lecturing, to show Lanz, "This stuff... Around this spot, this is where you get the best crowds. Hmph... but still, they like to push me round. 'We're at war here. Why aren't you fighting?' <em>they say</em>."</p>
<p>"Do you not need to be fighting?"</p>
<p>"The City's army is just for volunteers."</p>
<p>"Hoh..." A sigh that signifies he was in deep thoughts.</p>
<p>"There's plenty who're willing."</p>
<p>"Why's that?"</p>
<p>"'Cause it gets you others' approval."</p>
<p>"Hm... Yeah, well, it would, wouldn't it?"</p>
<p>"<strong>You think so?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You don't?"</p>
<p>"Well, who decides what has merit? And whoever's making the rules, how do we know they're right?"</p>
<p>"Hmmm..." That was food for thought.</p>
<p>"Hehehe, I mean, I don't really know anything. It's just..."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh?" He then look down at the box, which had some shillings placed in it. It has some soft cushion, colored peach, that surrounded it. The metal case was silver-plated.</p>
<p>"I think, isn't it fine if there's like <em>one guy</em> who makes the call for himself, you know?"</p>
<p>"Even if it ends up being pointless?"</p>
<p>"Hey, even pointless things can have a point... <em>down the line</em>."</p>
<p>Deep thought's sigh, "Hmph..."</p>
<p>"I wanna live my way. Take it one step at a time, the way I want. <strong>Reaaaaally live.</strong>" Lanz's eyes brightened up at such words. That was something that hits home in his heart.</p>
<p>Alas, he'd no time for such deep thoughts. The alarm suddenly blared. Three beep and one long pause, repeating. Raising his head to see what the non-distress alarm is for, the boy was brought back into his thoughts. "<strong>Oh, rats! Better scarper before the guards find me again.</strong>" And he walked off into the distance.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey!</strong>" Lanz called him.</p>
<p>The guy gave Lanz a final words, "<strong>...Tell you what.</strong> I've got a new trick... <strong>Just in the works. You should come and watch. Bye!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hohhh...."</p>
<p>All the while the other Ouroboros let him speak with the boy alone. Only after he left did Sena cheerily approached from behind, asking, "You OK there? Can I help out?"</p>
<p>"Nah... I'm <strong>allllll</strong> good." Skillful at having his feelings for himself, eh!</p>
<p>"Hmmm....?" She wasn't that convinced, but since he doesn't want to speak willingly, it's not like she could force anything out of him. And they looked up at the sky for a moment until Noah sounded from the distance,</p>
<p>"<strong>Lanz! This alarm's worrying. Head for the war room.</strong>" Not sounding distress, but it didn't died down either.</p>
<p>"<strong>Right. On it</strong>." Nodding to Sena whom took a look at him for reassurance, they joined the others.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the war room, Noah met Monica and another male Lost Numbers. They were briefed. "A cradle transport for the colonies?"</p>
<p>The guy named Travis, standing next to Monica, replied, "Yes. The report is calling it 'large-scale'."</p>
<p>Eunie: "And you want to 'liberate' it? Like you did that last batch?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Right, well. That explains the emergency assembly."</p>
<p>Lanz was straight to the point, "<strong>When? Where?</strong>"</p>
<p>Travis: "By our estimate, tomorrow, late night. Pedesto Valley Floor, at the Great Sword's base. <strong>Boss, the logistics</strong> guy wanted an overnight camping kinda deal."</p>
<p>Monica: "Approved. Sort out the planning."</p>
<p>"Just what I thought you'd say, so I took initiative. We can leave any time."</p>
<p>Mio asked the others, specially Noah, "What do you think? Should we lend them a hand with it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, gladly. If Monica's OK with it?"</p>
<p>Monica: "It's up to you. <strong>But if things don't go to plan</strong>, there might be a fight."</p>
<p>Noah nodded in acknowledgement, "We're prepared for that."</p>
<p>"Hmph... Then be my guest. Take this chance to show my soldiers that <em>Ouroboros</em> spark. <strong>It'll be an illuminating experience for them</strong>, fighting or not."</p>
<p>"All right. We'll drill them well."</p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving at Morrack Inlet, the group trailed behind the Lost Numbers on a sparkling sandy beach. They left their ships and levnises behind. Out of a sudden, Lanz started talking, perhaps venting, "Things used to be easier, ah?"</p>
<p>Taion: "What was?"</p>
<p>"All we had to do was <strong>bash</strong> heads. No thinking, <em>no nothing</em>."</p>
<p>"What about the dying part? You weren't scared?"</p>
<p>"Sure I was scared! But, at least I knew what was expected of me."</p>
<p>Sena sensed something else, "Wait a sec... You wanna go back to that?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Obviously not! Just sayin' how I feel. There's just too much snuff</strong> to consider nowadays! It's doing my <strong>nut in</strong>!"</p>
<p>Eunie casually suggested: "I think you should try it sometime. This thinking thing might not be so bad."</p>
<p>Lanz went rage for a sec, "<strong>Stop making it sound like I don't!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>You just said it yourself! 'No thinking, no nothing.'</em>"</p>
<p>He tried rebutting, "<strong>I was talking about before, you spoon.</strong>"</p>
<p>Now Eunie wasn't happy with the insult, stopped in her track and wrapped her arms around her breast, getting heated, "<strong>Sorry? Who're you calling a spoon?</strong>"</p>
<p>The others had to stop with the leading two blocking the track, "<strong>OH SHUT UP. If you're gonna act like a spoon, 'course I'm gonna call you one.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Uhh, it takes one to know one.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Whaaa--??!!!"</p>
<p>Sena tried to calm the two down, "Let's just chill our here, you guys..."</p>
<p>Eunie spit it out, "<strong>OK</strong>, then why don't you tell me where we are now? What's this region? <strong>C'mon, spill</strong>." Now Lanz's gonna do some thinking.</p>
<p>"Uh, it's, uh..."</p>
<p>"See, you can't tell your arse from your elbow. Doesn't that make <strong>you</strong> the spoon?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Just because I</strong> slept through that class... If I've been awake for it... Then..."</p>
<p>"Then stay awake, you spoon!"</p>
<p>While they continued quarrelling in the background, Mio had a chance to speak to Noah, "He's right. Things were easier..."</p>
<p>"Yeah! We had everything handed to us, back then."</p>
<p>"That's not quite true in your case though, is it?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah was surprised at how she saw him.</p>
<p>"You had thoughts. And deep ones at that. I can tell, <em>when we're playing together...</em>"</p>
<p>"But you have, as well..."</p>
<p>She doesn't rebut, "I hope... <em>we find an answer</em>."</p>
<p>Noah attentively looked at her, sensing her thoughts and desire, softly but unwaveringly asserted, "Absolutely... We'll find it, I'm sure!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving at a resting spot shadowed by some taller cliffs. Grass lacking magnesium carpeted the area, with a few trees stood beside the trail. The group sparsely occupied the region for a rest and updates. Noah and Taion accompanied Monica, whom was speaking to a Lost Number. Mio, Eunie, Manana, and Riku were chatting in another sub-group. Sena was speaking to Lanz.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey, guys!</strong>" As Sena was telling Lanz something, some excited guys came up to the group, flattering in his tone.</p>
<p>"Hmm....?" Well, that was cold.</p>
<p>"<strong>It's an honor! I mean, this chance to do an op with you guys...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Whaddya mean?" Excitement is suppose to spread excitement, but sorrow spread sorrow too!</p>
<p>"<strong>You're my heroes -- Ouroboros</strong>. I mean, I always knew a grunt like me could never measure up... Although, we all still dreamed of it. <strong>And now you're here in the flesh.</strong> Doesn't seem real."</p>
<p>"<strong>What's so great about us?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Before this op's done, we might have to kill old friends. How 'bout it? <em>Could you do it? Stab a friend?</em>"</p>
<p>Sena was shocked by what he'd said, trying to stop him from terrorizing the poor guy, "Lanz...!"</p>
<p>"I, I mean, that's..."</p>
<p>With a cruel tone, "If you're here with some half-arsed notions, <strong>go home</strong>."</p>
<p>It makes him felt sorry for himself, "<em>I-I'm sorry</em>, I just got excited..."</p>
<p>Another Lost Numbers approached the group. Unlike the one apologizing, this one had jealousy and hatred for the Ouroboros, talked bad in front of them "They talk big, but... when shit hits the fan, they might just double-cross us. You watch."</p>
<p>Lanz squinted his eyes, ready for a quarrel, "Urgh... You sayin' you can't trust us with the job?"</p>
<p>"Hundred percent. You've never trained with our unit before, never ever fought by our side. Way I see it, you're just some arsewipes who stole away what was rightfully ours."</p>
<p>"Huh!" Sena felt a heavy stone pressed against her heart.</p>
<p>Lanz didn't budge, "Oh yeah? If I let you down, shoot me. <strong>In the front or back</strong>, I don't care."</p>
<p>"Gee thanks. <em>Well that's awful big of you, pal</em>." And he just turned and walked away.</p>
<p>"Hmph..."</p>
<p>All the while, Noah and Monica watched the clash unfold from a distance away. Noah turned to her, "I'm sorry. Maybe we shouldn't have come..."</p>
<p>"No, this is good. <strong><em>It's how you build trust. You can only begin once you've gotten everything out in the open</em></strong>."</p>
<p>"Really...?"{{footnote: Behind, Taion was speaking to the Lost Number Monica spoke from before.}}</p>
<p>"One of my dad's favorite lines. <em>Wasn't it the same for you lot?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah recalled from before how Lanz shielded Sena's blow when they first met in the battlefield, how exchanging clash preceded the conjoin of the 2 groups. From distrust, to neutral, and painstakingly, to trust. "Yeah! You might be right on the mark!"</p>
<p>"I'm sure they'll settle down when they need to. They've got good role models today."</p>
<hr />
<p>The green Flame Clock Ferronis now parked outside, set camps in the dark. The rare streetlight provided a sense of boundary, but such dim lighting does not help the eye. From a platform atop, they tried to scanned for info{{footnote: Perhaps, w/o a binocular, wasn't very helpful.}} They stayed in the dark; only Sena's flaming hair flared in the night.</p>
<p>Monica concluded: "Our intel was right. <em>There's quite a few of them.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio challenged: "But, it's too quiet... There's barely any signs of life."</p>
<p>Eunie from behind, "<em>They're probably all conked out</em>."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>The fewer sentries, the better for us</em>."</p>
<p>Noah: "Monica. The cradles are in that transport?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes, it's likely. Let's head down.</em> If we go round from the right, <em>we can approach unseen</em>."</p>
<p>"Roger that."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group stepped into the transport. Yes, there are orange-fluid cradles lined against the wall of the transporting levnises, but Taion seem confused,  "What is this?"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>They're all empty?!</strong>" Nothing inside the cradles except orange liquid. He quickly dashed to check out the rest. Nothing, nothing, and still nothing. "<strong>Urgh!</strong>" He turned around and shouted, "<strong>MONICA! There's nothing in here! They're all empty!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>SON OF A-! REPORT!!!</strong>" She shouted to the other Lost Numbers.</p>
<p>Someone replied, "<strong>Same over here! We got cradles, but nothing in them!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urgh!" This is not feeling well... A trap...</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Monica?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Did we...? Did we just fall for a trap?</em>" That's the only possibility left, perhaps. A blinding light suddenly lit the ground from behind her; the group covered their face with their limbs as they tried to get used to the new brightness.</p>
<p>"Urgh!"</p>
<p>As they could start looking, Sena exclaimed, "They've got us surrounded!" Levnises and soldiers in a semicircle.</p>
<p>Taion: "Kevesi troops...?"</p>
<p>Therefore, he appeared with the bright light behind him, appeared like a saint-like hero appearing in movie theater, and commented while walking towards the group, "Well, doesn't it suck to be you... Every little step you made turned out exactly as planned. Now us, we're an elite unit, the all-stars of Keves. You lot have been doing as you pleased for long enough." As he spoke, other Kevesi soldiers emerged and closed in on the group. He continued, "<strong>Right here, right now</strong>, we're gonna correct that little mistake!"</p>
<p>Lanz first noticed his childhood nemesis, "<strong>GARVEL?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohhh?</strong> So you've actually heard of me? Guess I gotta give myself more credit than I thought!" He'd probably been reborn, so he didn't know who's Lanz. The others, his original group members, nevertheless joined him even after rebirth, stood by his side.</p>
<p>Eunie knew them, "<strong>Layla, and Hoope?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Sparks... They look like they're in their early terms. That means..."</p>
<p>"They got reborn?!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "That adds up. This lot... Soon after they moved to Colony 8, I hear they croaked."</p>
<p>Garvel don't like the look, sniped, "Don't dare look down on us second-termers. We were chosen! We are the elite! Now I don't know if you're Lost Numbers or what, but you're in our way and <strong>for that, your heads are gonna roll</strong>!" Behind them stood a Levnis; and they drew their blades as Garvel spoke.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lanz knocked Hoope{{footnote: We assume the boy's name is Hoope? Or is he Layla?}} unconscious.</p>
<p>Garvel: "Tch... Just finish 'em off already! <strong>I need that sweet, sweet life</strong>!"</p>
<p>Noah was shocked by how he could do this to his group members, shouted, "Hrrr... <strong>'FINISH 'EM OFF?!'</strong>"</p>
<p>He urged, "Hurry, run 'em through -- <strong>go on</strong>! Kill 'em dead! <em>That'll give me a good top-up</em>, <strong>nice and easy! Gotta love this ne Flame Clock</strong> the Consul was kind enough to give us! <strong>IT'S A BELTER!</strong>" The group just noticed the green Flame Clock behind him.</p>
<p>"Ohhh!"</p>
<p>Mio commented, "It's a different color..."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Yeah... That is no ordinary Flame Clock.</em>"</p>
<p>Garvel continued explaining, forte with his tone, "Back in my old colony, if some moron slowed you down, there was nothing you could do. <strong>Oh, you could kill 'em, sure</strong> -- but you wouldn't get any life from it. But around here, that's all changed! Here, life is the privilege of the strong! <strong>The final survivor</strong> gets to take the <strong>whole snuffin' cake!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Garvel...!</em>"</p>
<p>"You get it now, do you? The weaklings need to be taken outta the running, so gimme somma that <strong>sweet life!</strong>" Since they weren't doing it, he tried to do it himself, killing his own teammate. Noah immediately stopped him with the Lucky Seven, knocking off his blade and threw him off balance.</p>
<p>"Aiii!! You <strong>mudder</strong>...!"</p>
<p>Taion decided to show him what it means by elite, transforming to Ouroboros form as he spoke, "You can call yourself elite all you want. But do moderate your expectations."</p>
<p>The worst terror in life is unknown. Stock market, the future, whatever. This 'monster' is not introduced to him, nor had he seen one. He fearfully backed up, gasping.</p>
<p>"You're the same as ever, Garv. Only ever thinking of yourself..." Lanz called for his attention as he transformed too. "How're you gonna win against us like that?" Noah had already transformed without a speech.</p>
<p>"Huh Hurggghhh..." Now one unknown is fear, 3 unknown is terror. "Wh- <strong>The snuff is this?! No one told us about these monsters!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You are not to hesitate!" That female Moebius that spoke to Y earlier showed herself, her tone rude. As she finished, ballistic missile, like that Ethel launched at them from before, targeted the Ouroboros and Lost Numbers' inch by inch.</p>
<p>"Mehhhhh!!!" Riku and Manana shielded their eyes; the Lost Numbers (including Monica) got defensive. Some soldiers fall as they got shot.</p>
<p>"Hrngh!" Lanz was the first to act. He jumped and raised a shield in front of a soldier -- it's the Lost Numbers that mocked him from before.</p>
<p>The guy earlier that spoke bad to him: "What... are y-?!" Lanz saved his skin.</p>
<p>As the missiles died down, the Consul teleported in front of Garvel. "<strong>Lady Consul!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "I should've known..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Guess you can't have a Ferronis without a Consul, eh?"</p>
<p>"My, Ouroboros as well? I can't believe my luck. I supposed I ought to have <em>prepared better still.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "A woman...?"</p>
<p>She effetely spoke, "You like my children? <em>They're an anti-City special unit,</em> one that I have <em>diligently raised and lavished with love myself.</em> It has been, back-breaking, <em>to educate them so</em>. <strong>They'll have</strong> to earn much, <strong>much</strong> more life <em>for me before they're done</em>. I <strong>hate</strong> failed investments. So you see..." And she transformed into her Moebius form. Core in her belly button, with a ring encircling her breast, a diamond-shaped object directly in front of her breast attached to the ring; and the other features too random and complicated to describe in words. And her speech also changed -- she spoke twice as fast as in her Consul form! "<strong>I'll take you brats out myself to protect mine!</strong>" (The battle begun, and we know this woman is Moebius <strong>H</strong>).</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>What is this?!!! Nobody told me the Ouroboros whelps were so... horribly strong!</strong>" Her core had been damaged; black smoke escaped from it. "<strong>WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion, whom cancelled their Interlink, felt emotionlessly sorry for her, "Dear, oh dear. It seems your grasp <em>has exceeded your reach</em>."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>NOAH! CUT THE FLAME CLOCK! WE GOTTA RELEASE GARV AND THE OTHERS!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urggaaaaahhhhh!!! Yahhh" Still had his Interlink, he jumped at it, cancelled the Interlink, and smashed it into pieces.</p>
<p>The Moebius, before turning into blue moats, had her last words, "<strong>THIS SIMPLY ISN'T FAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIRRRRRRR!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Layla and Hoope was already conscious, with Layla exclaiming, "Wh-what just happened? Th-the Consul, she...!"</p>
<p>Hoope: "She just disappeared..."</p>
<p>Garvel was the most reactive, wasn't willing to accept the truth, called out with fear in his tone, "Lady Consul... Lady Consul...! What... <em>What am I supposed to...?!</em> <strong>AAAARRRRRRGGGGHHHH!!!</strong>" He launched himself towards the unequipped Lanz, used his tiny fist to punch him. Alas, his random punches had no fight for the buff Lanz, whom easily caught his fist and disengaged him (after a few dodges). As he tried to punch with another hand, Lanz threw him off and soiled his face. Climbing back up, he gave an angry look at Lanz.</p>
<p>"<strong>Drop it, Garv! Your Clock's gone.</strong> Just stand down!"</p>
<p>He immediately activated his iris to search for it. No sign, no sign, and still no sign of it. "<em>Urgghhhh....</em>"</p>
<p>"Peace... You don't have to fight any more."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>No more</strong> stealing of lives. No more charity from Consuls."</p>
<p>"<em>Wh-what're you on about? Get snuffed.</em> You're talking out of your arse. 'Don't have to fight'? Fighting is all that we know! If we don't have that, then <strong>what the snuff are we s'posed to do...? TELL ME! WHAT DO WE DO NOW?!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Back where the ships and levnises were, the Lost Numbers gathered around sparsely in many groups. Cargoes were being loaded onto the levnises. The Ouroboros gathered around except Lanz, whom was approaching the guy that earlier had expressed his dissent.</p>
<p>"Hey... Need some help?"</p>
<p>The guy turned to him, surprised, "Huh? <em>Ah, yeah</em>, nah. Been through worse." Then turning in a slight smile, he didn't held back his praise, "<em>Man, you guys. Stunning. You're so... far beyond us.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz humbly replied, "Ah, it's not a big deal. If you were one of us, you'd do just as well." And they started chatting about other stuffs, having to trust one another more after a teamwork.</p>
<hr />
<p>As they were leaving, Lanz turned for a final look at the Lost Numbers, "Think they'll be OK? Those guys."</p>
<p>Sena noticed he was leaving behind, approached him and asked, "<em>What's eating you, Lanz?</em>" The rest of the group hadn't stopped, moving towards one of the depot ships.</p>
<p>"Well... I just, worry we cut 'em loose a bit soon..." He recalled the fearful eyes, desperate voice of Garvel,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Tell me! What are we gonna do now?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Turning his back to him, Lanz softly commented, "How would I know?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>" You stole something from one but didn't replace it with something else?</p>
<p>Turning back to him, "You stop <strong>stealing lives</strong>. You guard 'em. It's simple. But the <strong>'how'</strong> is up to you. Got it?"</p>
<p>Garvel looked down, feeling more empty after the conversation, "<em>The spark...?</em> <strong>You can't do this</strong> to us...!"</p>
<p>Pausing a moment, he decided to give him at least one direction, "Colony 4... Know it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I've heard about it..."</p>
<p>"On your map, middle of the Fornis region. The lieutenant there, Bolearis, you can tell him we sent you. Try him. Helps to have a mentor, starting out." And he just turned and walked away, leaving him with only the slightest clue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You gave 'em the info. Now they got a choice." Monica joined in the recalling session, continued, "<strong>Some might</strong> take it hard, though."</p>
<p>"Besides, when we cut through the Flame Clock, it was to protect the City detachment too. There was little else we could do." Taion was scrupulous enough to notice the two not following; and Eunie joined him as he spoke.</p>
<p>Eunie: "If we'd meddled even more, it might've come right back round to bite us in the bum."</p>
<p>At the other side, Noah and Mio were also turning back, with Mio speaking, "We did the right thing by telling them about Colony 4. I think that was the best course of action."</p>
<p>"Urgh..." Lanz wasn't fully convinced, felt like he should've do something more, something he has control to do.</p>
<p>Monica: "Everything they believed came crashing down, just like that. They'll be confused for a while, sure. <em>But they'll figure it out, just the same as you lot did.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion recalled in hindsight, "We might've gotten off lightly. If we hadn't met like we did in that valley, we'd be just as confused as those guys. Luck was on our side."</p>
<p>There was a short pause as the group recalled, reminisced, and considered the philosophy. Taion had something more to add, pushed his glasses up and changed the topic a little, teasingly spoke, "Speaking of, back then... Wasn't it Lanz who was the most reluctant of us?"</p>
<p>"Hpfh..."</p>
<p>Eunie joined in the teasing session, "Nah, nah, nah... Our big man was <em>just a bit shy to introduce himself in front of new people!</em> Right?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ahh, shaddap.</strong>" And he turned away from them.</p>
<p>Sena felt the same, happily joined, "Ohh, yeah he was! I did kinda get the impression that he was embarrassed to speak up!"</p>
<p>"<em>Right? Eh?</em> Ahh, he's just a big teddy bear really!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Boarding the ship, it zoomed into the air, returning.{{footnote: Ironically, their ship 'Boundary' was left behind. Oops...}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in the City, Eunie and Taion were getting food from the torpedo wrap shop. Lanz was standing some distance away as Sena trod towards him, handed him a torpedo wrap, "Here, Lanz. Same dish as mine. Double Ardun meat, DE-luxe!"</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh, thanks a bunch."</p>
<p>Eunie, speaking to the owner, "Ohh, lessee... No tallspice here. But double veggies!"</p>
<p>Taion sat himself down, looking at the menu blackboard, excitingly exclaimed, "<strong>Ardun sausage, huh?</strong> <em>That sounds good...</em> But then... <strong>there's the tallspice sauce as well... Hm? Fluffcream and Skeeter syrup dressing?! What delights!</strong>" Now that's difficulty choosing when every choice is too good and you just want all but can't! "<strong>Ohh... There's even choclit sauce?! How can I... possibly choose?!</strong>" Eunie just shook her head.</p>
<p>He did managed to choose in the end, we don't know what. They ate alongside Lanz and Sena, standing on the road. The City's dark as usual.</p>
<p>Looking at his torpedo wrap, Lanz reminisced, "Still hard to believe, <em>huh? Eating what we want</em>." Now that's something to appreciate.</p>
<p>Sena didn't get the context, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"<em>But is it enough? I want more...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie couldn't believed what she heard, "<strong>Dude,</strong> that's already pretty hefty. You really gonna eat another?"</p>
<p>Just then, they heard the sounds of cheering some distance in front. Looking up, they saw a group gathered around the boy whom juggled. Happily as ever!</p>
<p>Sena recognized, "Oh, hey!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Whoooaaaa... He's pretty dece!{{footnote: Probably a shortcut slang for 'decent'.}}"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Or have I got it</strong> backwards...?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" The two didn't get it.</p>
<p>Taking another munch out of his torpedo wrap, and looking at the boy doing the skilled job, he hypothesized, "<strong>Maybe... <em>it has to start with me.</em></strong>" And he started walking towards the entertaining crowd himself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Kitchen behind bars. Inmates sat around tables and chat. Prison guards stood on a higher level to watch them out, while ladders behind bars to protect them from being overwhelmed by the inmates. The main room was where the kitchen was, lined with tables. Though, there were also some empty space where tables weren't placed. An alleyway lead downstairs towards the cells. Inmates were free to roam around with their cells unlocked. This, is <strong>Li Garte Prison Camp</strong>, of Cadensia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The group had entered the wind duct, watching behind the turning blades. No soldiers watched in their direction, but there were two guards with lance below, and a guard walking and stood in between these two, unseen the group above and behind him. Suddenly, some sound came from the opposite side of where the group was. A guard was calling out to the inmates on a protruded balcony.</p>
<p>"<strong>Good morning, you snuffin' reprobates!</strong> Beautiful morning today. If only I could appreciate it. Didn't get much sleep." The inmates turned to the first floor, where a guard, perhaps the head of the guards, sniped. "Do you know why? Because the eclipse draws ever nearer!" Walking while he speak, "How many of you are getting made an example of on Hope's Rest <strong>this time</strong>? I can hardly contain myself thinking about it! Couldn't catch a wink of sleep last night, me!"</p>
<p>The group were still watching behind the blades, with Taion heated up, exclaiming softly, "Nutty snuffer... He's really enjoying this." The others gritted their teeth, hearing her elated tone.</p>
<p>Stopping below the wind duct where the group was, his tone getting excited, "Yet, nonetheless, <strong>the show must go on</strong>. In order to unite our hearts and minds. To keep the world in balance, in perfect harmony! This will be your <strong>final resting place</strong>. So why not <strong>live a little?</strong> While you still have some-<strong>'body' to enjoy it with</strong>! Hah hah hah hah!" Then, he leave.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Tch! I'll give <em>him</em> something to enjoy..."</p>
<p>Eunie blurted out, " What term is he even? Is not like he'll have that much longer than them to live! <strong>Ah... Bollocks...</strong>" She finished speaking before realizing Mio was beside her, reminding her of something uneasy.</p>
<p>"It's OK. I'm not bothered. <em>I hate people like that.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group found a hole covered by metal grids which they could jump down, which the space below was unguarded. Noah: "This is... a warehouse of some kind?" There were barrels beneath, but otherwise we couldn't determine other contents.</p>
<p>Taion: "According to the schematics, that's what it is. What do you think, Noah? There are no guards, so we should be able to proceed..."</p>
<p>"You're right, seems safe enough. Let's get down through here." He detached the latch on the metal, which it bounced downwards and around an axle.</p>
<p>Lanz was reminded of something, "Hold up. Shouldn't we be taking off our eyepatches? Far as I can tell, the people being held in here don't have them on."</p>
<p>Eunie already took action before they even discussed the possibility of being caught, "Makes sense."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group, including the candidates, walked into the central hall and saw two inmates were preparing for a fight while others stood around, either cheering or just watching. The prison guard watched closely; but since they hadn't started fighting, he did nothing except observations. The group looked around, until a brown-skin female, sitting on a table cross-legged, with two buff bodyguard standing beside her{{footnote: And two other inmates, one sitting, another standing, not worth mentioning.}}, called out for their attention, "The hell'd you come here for?"</p>
<p>Jansen: "Ghondor..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Is that... Ghondor?" Noah was looking at the two bodyguard, wondering which of those two were Ghondor, ignoring the one speaking.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "I asked you a question. Gimme an answer, fresh fish!" She had thick black hair, large dark-lime-green iris, thick eyelashes, wearing a necklace with sapphire crystal encased with metal-like objects attached to a red string in an undefined shape. She wore two rings bundled around her biceps and triceps, an armpit navy blue shirt, checkered dark-white long-sleeve pant, and some red scarf around her hands like the ones to protect it when boxing.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah just realized. So, a woman, huh... for the name...</p>
<p>"'Huh'? Cut the crap. Any lights on in there, you deadbrain?"</p>
<p>"Hold on... Is Ghondor a...?"</p>
<p>"Is Ghondor a what? Finish your damn sentence! What? My name?! You got a problem with it?!" Her tone surely wasn't friendly.</p>
<p>Mio: "So she's... Ghondor..."</p>
<p>"Bitchqueen... She musta thought she was being funny..."</p>
<p>"Eheh!" One of the inmates sitting down laughed out accidentally, unable to suppress anymore.</p>
<p>"Ugh! Oh, so you agree, do you?!" She stood up, about to punch him. The guy whom laughed out quickly stood up and goes into a surrender mode.</p>
<p>"N-no! I... It wasn't-! I didn't mean..." The two bodyguards looked away. "Arrrgh!" Ghondor jumped and kicked him in his face. He flew and smashed into a wall.</p>
<p>As she switched posture back into a cross-legged sitting position, her two bodyguards caught up with her, and she continued, "Go die in a ditch, you turd."</p>
<p>Sena was surprised, "Yikes. Never thought I'd hear someone top Eunie's sweary mouth..." Even Lanz's mouth was slightly opened.</p>
<p>Mio teased her, "Don't you go copying her, Sena."</p>
<p>"Nah... Not my style."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't impressed with the gossiping. "Oh wow. Way to talk trash about one of your friends..."</p>
<p>Ghondor took the stage, "So? Where was I?"</p>
<p>One of the bodyguard bent down beside her ears to remind her, "Think it was about... why they're here?"</p>
<p>"Oh, right, that. So, what's the idea, sweethearts?"</p>
<p>"Now she's playing nice?" Eunie wondered.</p>
<p>Noah: "You're... Ghondor?"</p>
<p>"What's it to you?"</p>
<p>"Monica from the City... She told us about you. She said you'd know where the Queens are."</p>
<p>"Tch... So you <em>are</em> the Bitchqueen's lapdogs."</p>
<p>"Please, tell us what you know." He cared more about the information than the complex relationship between Ghondor and Monica, and her furious feelings. "We have... good reason to meet with them. To bring peace... and to set the world to rights."</p>
<p>"This shit <strong>again</strong>."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm fed up with hearing the sanctimonious Ardun crap."</p>
<p>Lanz concluded, "So you aren't gonna help us out then."</p>
<p>"If you're trying to kill the now, then you can just forget it."</p>
<p>Taion: "Erm, kill the now?" (What 'now'?)</p>
<p>"Did I bloody stutter? Oh, you just don't get it? Maybe this'll hammer it home." She squint her eyes, about to share something big, maybe? "Aggy! Oggy!"</p>
<p>"Ma'am!" The two bodyguards lowered their hands from cross-hands position.</p>
<p>"At your command."</p>
<p>She stood up and gave commands, "Give this lot a bruising and dump 'em in the trash!"</p>
<p>"Ma'am! My pleasure!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Inmates gathered around behind barriers, watching Ghondor, Oggy, and Aggy enter the central stage from one side, while the Ouroboros group stood at the other side. They were cheering like those cheers you see in an ancient Roman colosseum fight. Then, they summoned their blades. Aggy and Oggy used a stick with lights on both ends, while Ghondor had two giant boxing-like fist.</p>
<hr />
<p>Their fight is running out of control. "Huh!" Alerted, the guard turned around and punched a red button on a wall. Immediately, an emergency siren filled the room.</p>
<p>The siren doesn't disturb their fight. "Hwaa!" Seeing Ghondor's approach, Lanz did a horizontal slash. She kicked him in his wrist, he lost his grip on the sword, and she landed a punch in his stomach. Before he could re-summon his sword, she jumped into the air ("Grrrraaaaahhh!!!") and landed a knee-slice on him, sending him dragging on the floor. "Urgh!"</p>
<p>Satisfied at his state, she turned to him, "Hah! I put all my love into that one for ya. Ya better appreciate it!" Just after, Noah and Mio managed to intersect between them. A sudden light from her chest attracted her attention, "<em>Wait, it's glowing...?</em>" She realized it's Noah whom caused it, "HUH!"</p>
<p>Slowly getting on his feet, he warned, "Urg, ungh... Careful. She packs a meaner punch than you'd think, Noah!" Aggy and Oggy draws the others' attention.</p>
<p>"Yeah... No jokes."</p>
<p>From behind, Jansen agreed, "'Course she does. She's a pro. That's Monica daughter for you." Shania stood slightly behind him, hands crossed, depressed as usual.</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh?</strong>" Mio was surprised at her relationship.</p>
<p>Noah: "Daughter...? You mean... That she was born from Monica? Like that baby we saw?"</p>
<p>Jansen: "That's about the size of it. Plus, the head Ouroboros candidate."</p>
<p>"Huh!" Shania was unwilling to accept that. The Ouroboros were surprised.</p>
<p>Taion: "That too?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "You don't say. It all adds up now."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Oi! What are ya prattling on about? You got something to say, say it to my face!"</p>
<p>Noah: "We do!"</p>
<p>"Go on then!"</p>
<p>"Why are we fighting each other? It's so pointless."</p>
<p>"Piss off, no it's not."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Because you dags haven't figured it out."</p>
<p>"About killing the now?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then stop holding out, and just tell us!</strong>" Is this really the right place to say something when the guards probably can eavesdrop?</p>
<p>"Tch. <em>Set the world to rights</em>, you said."</p>
<p>"Yeah... I did."</p>
<p>"Not sure if you're just being self-righteous, but take a look around... Think about how many lives it's cost, running after that shit already!"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Their time to think is nigh. A group of guards came running towards the fighting ground. Ghondor sheathed her weapon, Aggy and Oggy followed.</p>
<p>One of them immediately shouted commands, "All right, that's enough! On your knees now, all of you! Hands behind your head! Disobey me, you'll get time in solitary!" The other surrounded them. They all had pike weapons.</p>
<p>Taion first sheathed his weapon, warned the others to do so, "Change of plan. Sheathe your Blades now! Let's... just do as he says, OK?"</p>
<p>"Mmm..." Mio agreed, and the rest followed. As for Riku and Manana, since their blades and cooking utensil can't be sheathed, they slid it towards the soldiers and put their wings on the ground. As Ghondor knelt down on the floor, the rest followed.</p>
<hr />
<p>They're not put in solitary. Indeed, back in their cells, which probably hosted 18-24 people with 3 to 4 rows of single-layer beds, the Ouroboros gathered around as Noah received communications on his iris.{{footnote: Let's forget about the few other inmates that also sit or stood around.}} "...OK, got it. Stay safe on your end too." After he closed off communication, he relayed the info to the others, "Jansen and the others are all in the same cell, it looks like."</p>
<p>Taion logically concluded, "If they didn't notice us coming in from the outside... I think we can call step one of the plan a success."</p>
<p>Mio, concerned with her hostility, "I wonder how we're supposed to get Ghondor to work with us..."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Yeah. The way she said we were <em>'trying to kill the now'</em>... Sounded like she might take some convincing."</p>
<p>Eunie crossed her arms, still don't understand, "Yeah, and what the spark does that even mean?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "I've no idea. But I think I want to ask Ghondor about it. Lots to talk about."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Talk? Dude, I'm not looking forward to raising a merry ruckus just to get out..."</p>
<p>The other inmates started walking out towards the central cell block. Riku, noticing the movements, commented, "That seem not strictly necessary."</p>
<p>Sena: "What d'you mean...?"</p>
<p>A Lost Numbers soldier walked pass them and gave the information they needed, "You're new around here, eh? If you don't stir yourself, you'll miss grub, you know." That's probably the limit of his kindness. He walked away without waiting for further questions nor replies.</p>
<p>Manana was flattered, "They even feed us?!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Well now. Seems we have more freedom than we initially assumed, here." Not confined within their cells all day long, huh...</p>
<p>Noah turned to the group, suggested, "Let's look for Ghondor."</p>
<hr />
<p>"I'll tell you what we should all do." Sitting down on the table, with Aggy and Oggy beside her, and other inmates roaming behind, in the central room. "<strong>Not. One. Friggin'. Thing.</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "We do nothing?"</p>
<p>"If we just stay put here, and the City folk keep a low profile, no one has to die for smalnuts."</p>
<p>Noah: "So that's your <em>'now'</em>?"</p>
<p>"Penny finally drops."</p>
<p>Lanz questioned, "Aren't they going to execute you next month?"</p>
<p>"So? It'll be 10 people, if that. They've got over a thousand locked up in here. It'll barely register."</p>
<p>"<strong>'SO'? Lives aren't statistics!</strong>" Taion shouted out.</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm saying if you stir shit like what Bitchqueen wants, you'll have a thousand lives</strong> on your conscience!" Noah breathed out quiveringly on her words. Adding to it, "And also... <em>You're</em> gonna set the world to rights? Then what's that there, on your arms? On your chests?" She got off the table and approached Mio, "And then there's the kitten... Little more than a month left?"</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"You must be the most eager of the lot."</p>
<p>"<strong>That's enough!</strong>" Noah sniped back, simultaneously launched himself towards her. After taking a step, Mio reacted immediately, putting on of her hand on his shoulder and look intimately into his eyes. Alas, his eyes was fixed on Ghondors'. Though, the touch from the person in concern was enough to make him took back a step.</p>
<p>She wasn't scared. "Hmph! <strong>Just shut up about the world already.</strong>" On the way back to her table, "All this holier-than-thou crap...{{footnote: She turned to Noah.}} You're only doing it for yourselves!"</p>
<p>"Hrrrr..." He gritted his teeth as his internal heart flared, her thought being stereotypicized and imposed on him.</p>
<p>"You just fight out of self-pity, flailing around thinking you can <strong>make a difference!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio had had enough, "Urgggh! <strong>When I see our lives... I do it with purpose!</strong>"{{footnote: Though, one thought she can bear herself being targeted, but if the one being targeted her de-facto partner.}}</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Just one more day... One more minute...</strong> <em>You've no idea how many lives we sent... All the friends we had... Wishing they'd had more time! That was each and every day for us!</em>" As if hope was lost, "<em>But it was all we could do. It was all we had to believe in... Day in, day out...</em>"</p>
<p>Ghondor questioned, "You are... an off-seer?" She nodded in return.</p>
<p>Looking up, recalling her moments in the City, "And when we finally made it to the City... I realized there was a whole different world out there. <em>'They're so lucky.'</em> I really thought that. I was astounded... <em>Just by extending our years, life could be so different?</em> I even saw the beginning of a new life...{{footnote: She held both her hands up, looking at them.}} That tiny little hand... <em>that was grasping mine...</em>{{footnote: Closing her eyes to retrieve the sense of touch from her memory.}} I can understand why you want to protect that.{{footnote: Clenching them into fists.}} If that's the 'now' you speak of, we'd never kill that.{{footnote: She turned to Ghondor, putting her hands into her appreciation stance.}} Still...! That's why! <strong>We're trying to protect it for you! To save our friends! <em>To build a future that would make us free!</em></strong>" The other inmates from afar were gathering sparsely around them, listening to their conversations.</p>
<p>The speech was touching, but she had her concerns, "You've got about a month. That enough? For that?"</p>
<p>"I don't know. My time might be up... before our fight is truly over. There's... <em>probably not that much I can do.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mio..."</p>
<p>Her eyes unwavering, "But... <strong>I've got to try! <em>I'll keep trying... while my flame still flickers!</em></strong> And after that..." She turned to look at Noah, whom nodded back to her. She turned to each and every one in her group, till Lanz gave verbal replies, "Yeah... We gotcha. We'll carry on your will! Right, Noah?"</p>
<p>"Of course. I don't really want to imagine that. But... <strong><em>there's just no running away from it. All we can do is move forward. We have to.</em></strong> That day... Guernica entrusted us with this power. And because of that, we made friends with... former enemies." Turning to Ghondor, "Believe us. Your <em>'now'</em>... is safe with us. As is the future."</p>
<p>Her tone soften, "So, that's your argument?" He nodded in return.</p>
<p>"Urggh..." She walked towards him, took off her necklace, and handed it to him. She dropped it on his hand.</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"For the Cloudkeep.{{footnote: She turned and walked back to her table.}} Where the real Queen of Agnus is takin' her beauty sleep. You'll need that to get in. Kinda like a key."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>Sitting on the table, "This thing took a liking to... Uhhh... Names?"</p>
<p>"Noah."</p>
<p>"Mio."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Noah and Mio. I'll remember that.{{footnote: Yeah! The legendary N and M!}} Mm, anyways, the doodad{{footnote: the necklace.}} reacted to you two when you teamed up. I think... it was probably, like, telling me to give it to you."</p>
<p>Noah: "Thank you..."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're helping us now?"</p>
<p>"Still hate the fact that Bitchqueen sent you. But hey, the wossname did pick you, so. And I did promise."</p>
<p>Noah: "Promise?"</p>
<p>"In three days, Agnus will be holding a large-scale training exercise on Daedal Isle. Of course, that means minimal security for us. That'll be our chance to escape."</p>
<p>"How, then?"</p>
<p>"Hehe... <strong>Well, the only way I know how.{{footnote: Turning to the other loosely-gathered Lost Numbers.}} Am I right?! Ya dags!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah!" The Lost Numbers chanted in unison, turned into their fighting pose, never so readied.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>I've... got a bad feeling about this.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie seconded, "Yeah. The proverbial's gonna hit the fan."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Them's the breaks. Take it or leave it."</p>
<p>Noah, in a robot-like voice, "All right. In three days."</p>
<p>"Just do some prison things until then. Oh, uh... Just try to keep in line, would ya? We don't wanna draw attention."</p>
<p>"We'll keep that in mind."</p>
<p>"Oh, and... a quick word of advice."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"<strong>When all is lost, let 'em hear you roar.</strong>{{footnote: The spark, one don't understand.}} Got that?"</p>
<p>"Hear us... roar?"</p>
<p>"All that power you wield? That's exactly what it was meant for."</p>
<hr />
<p>Before dismissing the group, she'd dismissed the other Lost Numbers, including her two bodyguards. "We're done today. Scuttle back to your hole, you rat bastards. If we keep crowding together like this, a nice Mr. Jailer might show up and rattle your empty heads together."</p>
<p>Noah: "No worries, we'll clear out."</p>
<p>"Ah, before you go, just one more word to the wise... If you're gonna pretend to be model prisoners, you'd better put some effort into the jobs the guards give you."</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "What kinds of jobs are they?"</p>
<p>"Hmm. It's different depending on the day. Anyway, come here again in the morning."</p>
<p>Noah: "We'll be here."</p>
<p>Manana cryingly complaint, "We have to wake up early?" Yeah, the only Nopon whom needs Riku to shake her up every time the sun caressed her bum bum.</p>
<p>Sena tried encouraging, "Looks that way, sweetie."</p>
<p>Riku adviced, "Noah, would be good idea to sleep early today. Early to sleeping, early to waking."</p>
<p>"Right." They head back to their cells immediately thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="day-1"><a class="header" href="#day-1">Day 1</a></h3>
<p>By the innermost side of the cell, Taion speaking to Noah, Eunie speaking to Riku, Manana with Mio. Outside, beyond their hearing range, stood Lanz with his arms crossed, looking down, back against the wall, and Sena beside him, both palms on her pelvis, also looking down.</p>
<p>"I'm envious."</p>
<p>"Of what?"</p>
<p>"You... Mimi... Noah... You're all so incredibly confident..."</p>
<p>"Who's confident? It's all... a big act. I don't know about Noah and Mio... But me, though? <em>I'm pathetic.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" That was surprising, not like what he'd been acting out.{{footnote: She turned to look at him, prompting for more.}}</p>
<p>"I'm just acting tough. To pump myself up like I'm not a wimp."</p>
<p>"You think you're... a wimp?"{{footnote: Looking back down.}}</p>
<p>"Yeah. I'm a lot... like you."{{footnote: Turning to look at her.}}</p>
<p>"Huh?" More surprises. She turned to meet his eyes, but he turned away at the last moment, avoiding such direct intimacy.</p>
<p>"But, look... What's wrong with that anyway? If we're weak... there's room to grow. <strong>Right?</strong>" His eyes met hers.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>To be more attentive, he stop leaning against the wall and turned his chest facing her, "Remember the first time you became Ouroboros? You yelled, <em>'Lanz! Come with me!'</em>, ah?"</p>
<p>"Mm..." She nodded.</p>
<p>"<strong><em>You reached out... for the strength you needed.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Ooh..."</p>
<p>{{footnote: Back to initial pose.}}"Our friend Joran... He became Moebius. <em>But that... That wasn't him</em>. <strong>That's his life's purpose? Like spark it is.</strong> So I think... Maybe... <em>I wanna figure out the purpose of my own life. I wanna get stronger.{{footnote: Looking up, as if to reminisce.}} And if Joran's surpassed me... I'll get even stronger than that</em>."</p>
<p>"Oh wow..."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>I won't be doing it for the recognition. Nor to be liked. I'll do it for myself.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Even if people don't recognize it? Right?"</p>
<p>He met her eyes with an unwavering look, "We're here. This is us. Let's keep being true to ourselves. <em>What's wrong with that?</em>"</p>
<p>"Same old... Lanz?"</p>
<p>"Same old... Sena." She turned away and recalled what Mio said years ago,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Never stop being you, 'Kay?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Recognizing your own purpose... Huh.{{footnote: Turning her attention back to him, (and asking for permission).}} You mind if I... pinch that mindset?"</p>
<p>"<em>Whatcha talking about? Friends don't need to ask.</em>"</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, "<strong>Huh?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Hahahahaha!"</p>
<p>"Hah hahahaha! Here's to us. <strong>The mighty weaklings!</strong>"</p>
<p>Her tone upbeat, "Yeah!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena and Lanz joined the cell, and the group gathered around, with Noah asking, "Is everyone ready?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh yeah."</p>
<p>Mio: "Ghondor told us to go to the central cell block."</p>
<p>Taion: "It's about the same time now as it was when we infiltrated the prison..."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't looking to see someone, "Ugh, what if that foul-mouthed jailer's there...?"</p>
<p>"He'll no doubt be at the morning gathering." To which Eunie just dropped her head in disappointment.</p>
<p>Lanz turned around with Noah, "OK then. Shall we go, my fellow model prisoners?"</p>
<p>Sena showed her muscles, "Good luck at hard labor, everyone!"</p>
<p>Eunie complaint, "Ugh, hope we get off lightly..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathered in the central cell with the rest of the jailed Lost Numbers, two guards approached a central balcony, and one of them, the prison warden{{footnote: Probably the foul-mouthed guy.}}, announced, "Good morning, prisoners! How are you this fine morning? It's a good day to show gratitude to your jailers! We let you keep your criminal lives, least you can do is work till you die! Them wot don't work, don't eat! And so, without further ado, here's your work details for today." He wore a taller horned helmet of diamond shape above his forehead than the other guards, just to differentiate who's who.</p>
<p>The prison guard took over the stage, announcing, "Today's food-gathering duty is in the Perimeter Woodland. You're to team up based on your assigned cell. First, gather 20 each of Carnomiles, Gold Burdocks, Peachy Truffles, and Honey Plums. That is all." Sounds laborious huh, collecting 80 items.</p>
<p>The group listened around for complaints, but was met with a relieve from Anton, a guy speaking near them to another guy beside him, "Phew, sounds like another breezy one today!"</p>
<p>Cory replied, "Oh, for sure. Might even be able to sneak in a napperoo, dontcha think?"</p>
<p>Eunie stopped eavesdropping. "Bleh... Seems plenty rough to me."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed. "Same. I don't even wanna think what a hard day's work looks like here..."</p>
<p>Mio noticed Taion got into analyzing mode, hence prompted, "Something wrong, Taion?"</p>
<p>"Those foodstuffs that the guard named... It's the exact same food that the Castle distributes to us."</p>
<p>Sena raised a hypothesis, "Hey, does that mean... The food the colonies receive, it's all picked here?!"</p>
<p>"It would be the natural conclusion..."</p>
<p>Noah: "So they're using the Lost Numbers as free labor..." Mio got into her appreciative stance, appreciated their hard work.</p>
<p>The prison guard continued, "We're now opening the gate to the Perimeter Woodland." A gated bar to the prisoner's "right"{{footnote: Applicable only to those facing the guard.}} opened up via some hidden mechanism, revealing an alleyway leading towards bright sunlight. He continued, "And no funny business, you hear me? Anyone acts suspicious, they get taken out. End of."</p>
<p>Mio reminded Noah, "We're supposed to keep our heads down until we can execute the plan..."</p>
<p>Noah nodded, "Let's just head for the woodland." They followed the other Lost Numbers, making their way out.</p>
<hr />
<p>After collecting, the group approached a prison guard, Noah called out, "We've collected our quota."</p>
<p>He nodded, "Let me be the judge of that." He agreed after counting, "All right then, here's the list for the next batch..."</p>
<p>Lanz was shocked, "Wha-?! We worked our arses off, and now you want more?!"</p>
<p>"You got a problem with that? Feel free to die if you prefer. We're keeping you alive outta the goodness of our bleedin' hearts. You wanna stay that way, you work."</p>
<p>Lanz squinted his eyes, prepared to launch at him, "What did you just-" He took steps forward, but Noah stopped him, speaking softly to remind him of their objective,</p>
<p>"Hey, we need to lay low until... you know."</p>
<hr />
<p>After another batch, the guard: "Right, that'll do it. Work's over for today. Back to your cells, you animals." He then walked away, and the group entered the alleyway towards the prison.</p>
<hr />
<p>At the alleyway junction connecting the cells to the central room, Eunie complaint, "Eugh... I stink of dirt..." No showers, huh!</p>
<p>Sena encouraged, "We gotta stay patient. Just two more days."</p>
<p>Mio connected, "It's inconceivable... All the people here have had to work like this every day...?"</p>
<p>Taion logically concluded, "They're being seen as expendable labor. I imagine the overseers don't even consider them human."</p>
<p>Noah considered and thought over the conversations for a while, but concluded that there's nothing he or they could immediately do to ease their situation, hence he reminded, "We need to keep our strength up for tomorrow. Time to call it a night."</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah. You're right."</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="day-2"><a class="header" href="#day-2">Day 2</a></h3>
<p>Gathered in a circle inside their cell, Mio called out, "Good morning. Everything's ready."</p>
<p>Noah: "Then let's get to the central cell block."</p>
<p>Eunie, with an tempered tone, "Let's all give our best to the ol' penal colony again today, mateys."</p>
<p>Sena: "Hahahah..."</p>
<p>Lanz noted, "That Ghondor certainly enjoys skiving off, considering how insistent she was that we keep our heads down."</p>
<p>Taion: "Actually, if I recall correctly, she said to 'pretend to be model prisoners'."</p>
<p>Noah: "Whatever we do, we have one more day of it." They all agreed and made their way for the central block.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the final group arrived, the prison guard{{footnote: with the warden standing beside him, hands crossed,}} gave his words: "The job today is culling the Feris population living in the Perimeter Woodland." The prisoners nodded at each other before the guard continued, "Anyone who kills a Feris will be excused from other duties for the rest of the day. Make sure to bring proof when reporting in. Not just any Feris, though! The idea is to eradicate the ones that are going berserk."</p>
<p>Lanz was upbeat, "Well, that's much more like it! No more digging in the dirt like yesterday."</p>
<p>"The Ferises are reported to have mauled a large number of people yesterday. Have fun out there!"</p>
<p>Dana questioned the guard, "Why don't you use your Levnises? It'd make quick work of them."</p>
<p>"Any units assigned here are being prepared for the war games tomorrow. Even if they weren't, why bother wheeling out the big guns for something this trivial? Especially when we've got you lot." Expected but sad. "Now get out there -- the day's a-wasting. Anyone found disobeying orders will be terminated on sight!" They took off for the alleyway.</p>
<p>Eunie: "He sounded pretty gleeful about that, don't you think?" The Ouroboros hadn't yet moved their buttocks, dropping behind the others.</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Gleeful's the word, yeah. All he's gonna have to do is sit back and enjoy the show while we're out there, fighting crazed Ferises."</p>
<p>Taion: "I cannot understand how one can derive any pleasure from such a cruel pastime..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Still, we ought to move out." They trailed behind the last group to exit the alleyway thereafter.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor, Aggy, and Oggy were fighting a crazed Feris when Noah called out to them, "Ghondor!" The group joined beside them.</p>
<p>"Huh?! Oh, it's you dags... I thought I told you to keep a low profile? Go on, get outta here!"</p>
<p>Mio disagreed, "You won't get rid of us that easily."</p>
<p>"Pah, suit yourselves. Then let's at least make it quick."</p>
<p>Noah: "Not a problem." They drew their blades and joined the fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway, the crazed Feris, seeing that it can't win, turned around and ran off. Lanz was surprised at its sudden clearheadedness, "Huh?! Oi, stop right there!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Fast legs on that one."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Don't sound so impressed."</p>
<p>Taion first sheathed his blade, "We lost it, huh...?"</p>
<p>The others followed sheathing their blades, with Noah giving instruction, "We better run after it." {{footnote: There were some tame pink deer behind, but let's forget about it.}} Sena didn't make a move, concerned about the few injured Lost Numbers lying or sitting on the ground beside her. She questioned,</p>
<p>"Uhm, what about these folks here...?"</p>
<p>Ghondor kept her emotions behind bars, "I'm touched by your concern, but they're experienced soldiers, all right?"</p>
<p>"But...!" Ghondor can't believe her persistence. She walked towards the soldiers and shout out, hoping to incite efficiency and progress in them,</p>
<p>"C'mon, you lousy grunts! You gonna keel over from tiny scratches like that?! Pathetic! You get up right now, or so help me, I'll tear you limb from limb and feed you to the Ferises my-bloody-self."</p>
<p>Anton: "Urk..." They tried, but failed. Words can't soothed the physical pain, what says healing it.</p>
<p>"Lazy gits, I swear..." Turning to the group, "I'll pile 'em up somewhere outta the way, then I'll come find you. Go on ahead now. Don't waste the head-start."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with the job-splitting, "... As you say."</p>
<hr />
<p>The Ouroboros themselves quickly caught up with the Feris near the fenced perimeter corner. Sena: "We caught up with it."</p>
<p>Summoning their blades, Noah instructed, "Good. Now let's take it out before it hurts anyone else!"</p>
<hr />
<p>As the Feris turned into blue moats, they sheathed their blades and Eunie sighed with relief, "Phew... We took it down somehow."</p>
<p>Lanz: "They sure don't mess about with the work detail here..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Our duty is accomplished... What now?"</p>
<p>Noah: "We should probably go report it, but-" Maybe the guards may gave them a second round if they go in too early? Or maybe, its shameful to assume they kill it themselves without Ghondor's help.</p>
<p>Just then, Ghondor, Oggy, and Aggy ran and caught up with them, with Ghondor being surprised at their speed, "Oh, what? You already took it out? But I barely got to go nuts yet!"</p>
<p>Mio: "'Go nuts'...? You really have a taste for battle..." Eunie couldn't have agreed more.</p>
<p>"Ah well, what's done is done. You dags better hop to it and report to the guard."</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh? Are you sure?"</p>
<p>"Sure I'm sure. You earned it, didn't ya?" Turning to the fences, she noted, "Anyhow, since there's not a lot of attention on this place, we'll take a look around and scope things out for tomorrow."</p>
<p>"All right, if that's how you want to play it..." Ghondor leaves the Ouroboros to report in while they check things out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Approaching the guard, Noah spoke for the group, "We've defeated a Feris that had gone wild."</p>
<p>"Oh, you have, have you? Where's the proof?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Here you go, the thing's horns."</p>
<p>He shook his head in disagreement, "Pfft, you coulda taken that from any old Feris. It won't count as proof for me." Here he goes again, as expected!</p>
<p>"You wot...!"</p>
<hr />
<p>The group gathered in the central cell block to discuss, "What the ever-snuffing sparks? That guy really gets on my wings..."</p>
<p>Noah, intending to keep his profile down, "Nothing to be done. Let's go back and look for something that'll convince him."</p>
<p>Lanz was unsatisfied, "Ugh... More walking? Great..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Re-entering the Perimeter Woodlands, the Ouroboros clashed with Ghondor and the two, with Noah calling out, "Oh, you're done already?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much. More importantly, what are you lot doing out here?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Let me explain..."</p>
<p>"Well, sure sounds like that guard gets off on messing with you guys... Take these." She handed them a Giant Feris Horn.</p>
<p>Noah: "Huh...?"</p>
<p>"You give him those, even he'll have to leave ya alone." Oh yeah, <em>giant</em> is the key to strength, to fear, to intimidate!</p>
<p>Mio: "Thanks for that." The group re-entered and approached the guard.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah: "Here, proof that we did what we said."</p>
<p>"Hrmm... Well I'll be{{footnote: Is it "Well it'll be" instead? One double checked, but the words are correct. Perhaps they had a typo? "I'll" used here seems to have no special meaning, nor special relations.}}. It looks like you really did take down that Feris. I'm a man of my word. You're relieved of duties for the rest of today." He then walked off while Ghondor and the two approached the group from behind.</p>
<p>"Sounds like you did well."</p>
<p>They turned to face them, with Noah appreciating for the group, "Thanks for the help, Ghondor."</p>
<p>"Don't even mention it. Besides, I also wanted time to talk about tomorrow."</p>
<p>Taion agreed: "Good point. I do want us to go over the details together." They went and get around a table.</p>
<hr />
<p>===</p>
<p>"We make our move at 0800, right after outdoor duties start. My men will cause a commotion outside, draw out the guards and jailers. The guards will be armed, so you dags will need to deal with them. Use the element of surprise."{{footnote: As usual, she sat at the table, and the surrounding was empty, presumably the others haven't completed their task of the day yet.}}</p>
<p>Noah concernedly questioned, "And the jailers?"</p>
<p>"They're small fry. I'll take care of 'em."</p>
<p>"All right."</p>
<p>Lanz: "How many guards?"</p>
<p>"'Bout 30. Take out 20 or so and we'll be sitting pretty. Then, we break straight through the west gate. We'll have you lot covered, so just run for it."</p>
<p>Taion: "And how do we <em>'break through it'</em>? It's not like it's made of tissue..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Surely you lot can handle a gate?</strong>{{footnote: Bro, manager gives you the direction, the why, you'll have to think of the 'how' yourself hahah!}} Why else would the Bitchqueen even send you?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Why do you keep calling Monica that? She's your mother!"</p>
<p>Her emotions roused high, "<strong>I'll call her whatever the hell I like!</strong> Anyways, you all got the gist of the plan now?"</p>
<p>Taion, scrupulous as usual, "You call that a plan? There's nothing to get. We don't even have any contingency measures, do we?"</p>
<p>"Tch. I bet you're fun at parties. Arsehat..."</p>
<p>To which he just softly replied, "I'd prefer 'level-headed', thank you."</p>
<p>Standing up, "Anyhow... We'll gather in front of Watchtower 1. After breaching the gate, thin out. You run and you don't look back. Clear?"</p>
<p>Noah: "OK. We'll do that."</p>
<p>"Good. You're dismissed!"</p>
<p>The group turned and leave, while Noah had last words, "Ghondor!"</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"Please, just.. just be careful."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ahah!</strong> Who d'you think you're talking to?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The two group descended the staircase towards the junction leading to their cells. Ghondor was walking beside Sena, asking her, "You look like you'd make short work of that gate."</p>
<p>"Huh, me?"</p>
<p>"That wallop of yours on the first day. One helluva hit. You sure give 'em a run for their money! Haha!"</p>
<p>"Ah, thanks a lot..."</p>
<p>"Looks like someone's raring to go." Shania had her backs on the metal gate that separated the guard's sector and the prisoner's sector, calling out as the two passed.</p>
<p>The two stopped and had their attention on her, "Shania!"</p>
<p>Ghondor, folding her hands around her chest, "Well, look what the Hox dragged in."</p>
<p>She took steps towards the two, her voice full of jealousy and confidence as she spit her words out, "Nice to see you too, Ghondor. I've been here the whole time. You didn't notice?"</p>
<p>"Oh I'm sorry, want a medal?"</p>
<p>"Ugh... Arrogant as ever."</p>
<p>"Anyway... Think you're ready for this?"</p>
<p>"<em>'Who d'you think you're talking to?'</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Oooh, touchy</em>. <strong>Just don't screw this up!</strong>" Ghondor then leaves the two behind. Sena ran after her while Shania watched them leave.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" Their cold wars was outwardly displayed.</p>
<p>The others were far ahead, the two didn't catch up. Sena had to ask, "You and Shania were... 'friends from the crib', was that it?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, since we were kids."</p>
<p>"I didn't realize."</p>
<p>"Chick didn't know when to stop following me around. Had it up to my ears with her."</p>
<h5 id="start-of-ghondors-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-ghondors-memories">Start of Ghondor's Memories</a></h5>
<p>In the Memorial Hall, in front of one of the statue, Ghondor, her hands folded, spoke to Shania, her heads down. "Heard you bombed the selection test. And not for the first time."</p>
<p>With a crying tone, "<em>Yeah... I couldn't win, in the last round.</em>"</p>
<p>"Why'd you use the cestus?" These are the gloves that had 4 cyan-light bars in front of them, which we'd seen in Keves training camp lots of chapter ago. "You can barely throw a punch, makes no sense."</p>
<p>"Because... I thought if I used <em>your</em> weapon, I could capture a bit of the <em>Ghondor spirit</em>..."</p>
<p>She got furious at her, "<strong>You know that name pisses me off!</strong> And more excuses, eh? <strong>Stop <em>copying</em> me.</strong> You're even wearing my gloves now?" That refers to the gauntlet she had on her hands, of the same red color, each ended on the crest of the fingers on one end, and the elbow on the other."Right! Enough is enough."</p>
<p>Her teeth gritted, didn't get the praise nor the cheer she needed. Her palm clenched into a fist. Ghondor kept waiting and waiting.</p>
<p>"Nothing to say for yourself? <strong>Ugh, Peng on a Levnis! Don't you have any originality? It's no wonder you lost. No wonder you never get picked.</strong>" She didn't even raise her head.</p>
<h5 id="end-of-ghondors-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-ghondors-memories">End of Ghondor's Memories</a></h5>
<p>"I have my style. She has hers. Why doesn't she get the message? I'm so sick of it!"</p>
<p>"Hey, now..."</p>
<p>As Shania watched the two leaves, a male (probably a Lost Numbers), his face outside the camera's range, approached from behind Shania and asked softly, "They seem confident... Are we OK?"</p>
<p>"Everything' going to plan. Everything's fine. <strong><em>Everything...</em></strong>"</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-day-of-escape"><a class="header" href="#the-day-of-escape">The Day of Escape</a></h1>
<p>The next morning. Sena excitedly announced to the group, "So, today's the day we break out here, huh."</p>
<p>Mio: "Is everyone ready?"</p>
<p>"Manana take many-many rest so that can run flashy-dashy!" The rest agreed with Mio.</p>
<p>Taion: "The time that Ghondor specified is after the beginning of outdoor work."</p>
<p>Noah: "We should keep our heads down and work until she gives the signal."</p>
<p>Eunie, the 3rd day feels like vomiting, "Ughhh, we'll have to listen to that shitehawk again at the morning assembly."</p>
<p>Lanz ushered patience, "Last time, though."</p>
<p>Riku: "Friends stay concentrated."</p>
<p>Noah: "Right. Time to get everything together for the escape. When we're all sorted, let's go to the central cell block."</p>
<hr />
<p>By the central cell block, prisoners had already gathered to hear the shitehawk speaking. As usual, standing beside the warden, "Here is your duty for today: you are to gather Beautiful Shoots and Fluffy Cloud Ears. Furthermore, the following is an assignment for the prisoners who defeated the Feris yesterday. You are tasked with culling the Garaffas grazing near the Perimeter Outlet."</p>
<p>Noah: "Wait, just us...?"{{footnote: Maybe they meant only them who killed Ferises yesterday? One don't know. No info on what accomplishments the other prisoners have.}}</p>
<p>"Once the Garraffas are culled, you are to also cull the Quadwings. Finally, tidy up the Food Storage area." Well, that's the drawback of showing a Giant Feris Horn -- revenged is expected! "Once you're done with that, you're on the usual duties with the rest of the prisoners. That's all. You're dismissed. Now get to work." The other Lost Numbers immediately set out to the alleyway without waiting a second, while the Ouroboros lingered behind.</p>
<p>Eunie, with especially glum face, complaint, "Ugh. That pillock expects us to deal with all that ourselves...?"</p>
<p>Lanz was impressed, "We've been such model prisoners. Bet he's taken a shine to us." OK, that was another angle to look at the situation! Eunie just shook her head, unable to agree.</p>
<p>Mio, speaking to Noah, "We should go too." The others had already leave the room. They're gonna look quirky alone here.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside in the battling sun, on the grassy land casted with tree shadows, the group gathered in a circle. Sena was still as excited as ever{{footnote: Well, OK, whenever she was going for muscle jobs, at the very least.}}, "M'kay, that's one job done."</p>
<p>Lanz looked around, "Still no signal, eh..."</p>
<p>Noah seek for Taion, "I wonder if something's gone wrong..."</p>
<p>"We can't afford to arouse suspicion before we receive our orders. We'll just have to endure the work, loathsome as it is."</p>
<p>Lanz threw his arms in the air, Eunie heads down shaking, "Blahh, for real now...?"</p>
<p>As Sena tried to cheer her up, Mio was deep in thought... "Hmm...?" Some noise in the distance seemed to catch her attention.</p>
<hr />
<p>The top of the prison exploded, followed by the ground, and everywhere else. Emergency alarm began blaring. Noah, currently knelt down under a tree{{footnote: Perhaps collecting stuffs.}}, looked up and saw dark smoke polluting the clear blue sky. He reacted a few seconds later, announcing to the group, "That's up! OK guys, take out the guards!"</p>
<p>Seeing such messy situation, Taion spit out, "Ah yes, the illustrious 'plan'..."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're still whinging about that?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes, I am!</strong> It's all so messy."</p>
<p>Eunie can't understand his cautiousness, "You would say that. Hey, if it gets the job done, what's the problem?"</p>
<p>"<em>Assuming</em> it works."</p>
<p>She tightened her eyes; her hopes as optimistic as the speculators in internet stock before the dot-com bubble, in real-estate before the housing bubble, "It will! We're gonna make it work! C'mon!" She dashed off thereafter the urge.</p>
<p>It's not like he could change anything now, could he? "Whatever you say."</p>
<p>As the others walked pass him, Mio's eyes met with his. It took them a while to nod at each other before catching up with the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>After finished the guards, they whom had put their eyepatches back on, gathered below the watchtower as agreed upon. Standing in between a floor of corpses were Ghondor, her two bodyguards, and some distance away, Shania. Noah called out as they arrived, "Ghondor!"</p>
<p>"Took your time, didn't ya?" Seeing their arrival, the other 3 gathered behind Ghondor. The exchanging gunshots and blaring siren continued in the background.</p>
<p>Sena scanned the corpses, "Wow, you sure didn't waste any...!"{{footnote: Probably 'waste any time', their speed and 'efficiency' better than theirs.}}</p>
<p>"No time for chitchat. My friends are gonna cause a distraction, and we're gonna make a run for the west gate."</p>
<p>Mio heard something from afar, turned around and remarked, "It looks like quite a few people are fighting already."</p>
<p>"Good, then they can have another brawl later. I'll take the lead, all right?" Turning around, "Let's dance, bitches!"</p>
<hr />
<p>A gate they pass through raised; soldiers entered the Perimeter with their blades.{{footnote: Sound silly to me, raising the gates: it just made them easier to escape.}}</p>
<p>Noah: "Reinforcements?!"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Eyes on the prize! Boot these arseholes out of the way and the west gate is in our sights!" Just another stepping stone before arriving at their destination.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group could now see a metal solid double door{{footnote: Gate have holes in between so you can look past it; a door, however, is a plank of opaque wood/metal/whatever material. That's how one distinguish them.}} in the distance.</p>
<p>Mio called out for the strongest among them to handle it, "Sena! You're up!"</p>
<p>"I'm on it! Lanz?"</p>
<p>"Right here!"</p>
<p>Interlinked with Sena at the helm, they glide forward with the 'wings' opened up, picking up speed, jumping high up; the wings transformed into a hammer. "Rrrraaaaagh...!" The hammer slung like a catapult and slammed itself against the door. The door swung on its hinges, slammed against the wall on both side, sending dusty dirt in the direction of the force.</p>
<p>As if an opened dam, the feeling of freedom washed over Ghondor; Stopping on the track as she exclaimed with excitement, "Well, shiiit! Hahah! So much for us giving you backup! Haha... What a joke! All right! All o'ya! Let's bust this joint!" She picked up velocity again, and the other Lost Numbers, including the Ouroboros, followed.</p>
<p>"Ma'am!"</p>
<p>"Aye!"</p>
<p>From beside, Sena and Lanz rejoined the group as they dashed past the door together. In the lead, Noah heard some sound from above, raised his head, and stopped just before something shot on the ground before them. They raised their hands to cover their face from the incoming dust storm ("Ugggh!"). Upon clearance, three giant Levnis/Ferronis floated in front of them. These three giant structure have cone-shaped torso, a circular object floating behind their torso, and their wings put in front of them as if holding a staff with your fingertips touching each other, palm facing inwards. Their front and both their flanks have been cut.</p>
<p>Mio recognized something, "That design... They're the Castle Guard!" There's a 'M' symbol, with some recursive triangles above that 'M', imprinted on their head.</p>
<p>Eunie was confused, "What the spark?! I thought they were supposed to be away doing their bloody training?!"</p>
<p>Noah: "An ambush?! <strong>Ghondor!</strong>"</p>
<p>"This ain't an accident... Means one of you bastards... snitched."</p>
<p>As the Castle Guard floated low above the ground, more soldiers and levnises appeared from behind them. In a semicircle, some Lost Numbers' had joined the Agnians against the escaping crowd. The betrayed Lost Numbers' and Agnian soldiers marched slowly towards the group, forcing them back. The stopped at a distance, and the head of the betrayals, <em>Shania</em>, stood out as the representative, and the head.</p>
<p>Sena took a run forward, shocked to see who's causing their oblivion, "Shania...? <strong>No</strong>... How could you...?!"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "<strong>You bitch! Answer her!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ahah!"</p>
<p>While they were dealing with that, "Hrgh-...!" Noah felt the thundering headache he last felt in the Keves Castle.</p>
<p>Mio, standing beside him, noticed his abnormality, "What is it?!"</p>
<p>"Head's... pounding...!"</p>
<p>"...Such foul-mouthed creatures... She was right to sell you out." Standing atop the central Castle Guard was N and M, their mask intact.</p>
<p>"Ug-Agh!" Mio now understood what Noah felt. <em>M was looking straight at her.</em></p>
<p>The others were too absorbed in the situation to care for their head. Lanz recalled, "Wait... We've seen him before!"</p>
<p>Noah immediately answered him, "He's back... again..."</p>
<p>N continued speaking after they teleported onto the ground in front of the Castle guard, taking steps towards the group in the meantime, "She made a choice. Which will result... in one of the best outcomes one could've hoped for." Shania was clearly satisfied at his words.</p>
<p>Taion: "I don't see how..."</p>
<p>"Of course. It's quite unfavorable... for your little band of heroes." He pushed his sword down such that its handle point towards the group.</p>
<p>Lanz was up for it, inciting N's impatience, "You throwing the levs at us? Bring it. Been wanting to smash something up!"</p>
<p>"Hah. Not so fast, boy." To which Lanz growled back at him. "Your luck well and truly..." He touched his fingertip at his iris and unmasked himself, "...came to an end." The moebius symbol therefore glowed  bright red!</p>
<p>Noah can't believe what he just saw -- an older version of himself! N continued: "On the day you chose to stand against M and N!" M followed and revealed herself, with her moebius symbol. The horror washed over Mio; she gasped at her reflection.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Noah, and..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Mio...?! But how?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Those Moebius were... Noah and Mio? Wh-what's goin' on?"</p>
<p>Sena: "How's this..."</p>
<p>His head still throbbing, yet had lots of questions unanswered, "Who is... this guy? It's not just that he looks like me, but... huh... He's Moebius...! And then there's..."</p>
<p>Mio: "We have... the same face."</p>
<p>As Ghondor and the others tried to figure out what'd happened, "Hahahahaha." Shania was laughing from the bottom of her stomach, "<strong>AHAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Ghondor had to spit out the words, "Shania..."</p>
<p>In an elated tone, "<em>Now there's the look I've wanted to see! The look of a woman buried under the weight of her misguided expectations!</em>"</p>
<p>"Urgh... Urgh..."</p>
<p>Sena: "How could you, Shania? Why are you siding with them? You're with the City! The people here, they're <em>your</em> people!"</p>
<p>As if hearing something very funny, "<em>My</em> people? <strong>These paws? AHAH!</strong> People that rush towards an early grave without any consideration for the lives of others... are no bloody kin of mine!"</p>
<p>Ghondor took steps forward, still swearing, "<strong>Piece of</strong>... This what you want?"</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, you've had it easy, my friend</em>. The great Guernica was your grandad, and your <em>mediocre mother, the City Elder</em>. Oh, and let's not forget your <em>stellar Ouroboros results</em>? Hahaha... <strong>Of course you would have to ask that... You never did care about what I wanted!</strong>" That left Ghondor speechless.</p>
<p>Something that shadowed Sena for long, that she don't dare to speak, finally found its dam opened. Quiveringly, she answered a question long asked, "<strong>We're not the same at all.</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio was dumbfounded by her suddenness, "<em>Sorry?</em>"</p>
<p>She continued without replying to her, "You said... You said, that we were the same. <strong>But we're nothing like each other!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ugh... You sure changed your tune. I'm seeing some newfound determination. <em>You get a little pep talk from your friends, huh?</em>"</p>
<p>"Nobody <em>gave</em> me anything. It's because <strong>I'm part of the team.</strong> I'm only just starting to figure it out, now." Shania's eyes squinted at that, their diversion in thoughts, but Sena's tone was assertive, "<strong>But I'm gonna change.</strong> Both me, and this world!"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>I won't let you!</em></strong>" Oh, the quickness with which words flowed out before processing it through her unconscious mind. Sena could only gasped at her determination cut short, "<strong>I'll never let that happen!</strong>"</p>
<p>"If you stop us, everything's just going to stay the same!"</p>
<p>"<strong>IT WON'T STAY THE SAME!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Shania!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What's so natural about the life you want? A life you only get one shot at? At any point, someone could come along and tell you, 'OK, that's it, time to go!'</strong>"</p>
<p>"And who are you to say that life's worse?!"</p>
<p>"<strong>I know more than you!</strong> <em>It's madness wanting a world like that!</em>" She couldn't believed what she'd heard. Someone going in opposite direction, being jealous at the lives of each other, and taking their path on the opposite direction, could not convince each other on their clashing philosophy. "The best world for us... <em>is a world</em> that at least <strong>gives us another go!</strong>"</p>
<p>Ghondor had the time to stop her foul mouth and listened to her shouts after all the time; first time in her life to use her ears than her mouth.</p>
<p>"We fail, we try again!" Then, pointing at Ghondor, "<strong>We might do even better next time round!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Shania... Enough now..."</p>
<p>Sena clenched her fist, mustering confidence in her tone, "We're made to fight! <strong>To kill each other!</strong> <em>Every single day!</em> Just hoping to see another dawn!"</p>
<p>"Either way, we're still fighting for survival, aren't we?!" No more words can get to her. She had justified herself. No amount of proof, no amount of logic, no amount of emotion can convince one whom had made up one's choice. Words that Sena thought was their anchor to be released from the shackles was distorted as it entered her mind and became justifications. "Am I crazy? Am I saying something strange? <strong>'Cause I don't think so!{{footnote: OOOHHHHHHH YEAH!}} I genuinely don't!</strong>"</p>
<p>As they were dealing with their emotions and debate, Noah assessed their situation, counting in his mind, "<em>Twenty to the right... Twenty on the left... Ten in the middle... The Moebius, too... Patulia Bay...? It's that way.</em>" "Ghondor!" He moved in front of her, his hand stuck out from behind, handling her the Cloud Keep key. All the while, he face forward to not attract the attention of their enemy. As she looked down,</p>
<p>"Huh? What? What are you...?"</p>
<p>"Head for the exfiltration point."</p>
<p>Taion: "Noah... Wait..."</p>
<p>"It's us they want to capture. <em>I'm gonna engage the Levnises on the left-hand side. You can use that as a diversion.</em>"</p>
<p>"Shut the hell up! We'll make the diversion!"</p>
<p>"<strong>You're too slow!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>"<em>We can't all make it out.</em> However... A single unit should stand a chance." Lanz agreed with his decision, Eunie too. Taion could only shake his head. But Mio and Sena also supported him. They had prepared to die.</p>
<p>"What are you guys gonna do?"</p>
<p>"We fight, and worst case, we surrender. <em>Let them hear us roar.</em> Remember?"</p>
<p>That's not how you use my advice! "N-now, hold on..."</p>
<p>"Now's the time! Ouroboros doesn't end with us." He paused for a second before turning to her over his shoulder, "Right, candidate?"</p>
<p>"Noah... Damn you..."</p>
<p>"You'll do great. I know it." As her eyes scanned the other Ouroboros, Lost Numbers, Oggy and Aggy all watching her, she closed her watery eyes and snatched the key from him. Phew, that's something put down. Now, they could face their enemy. "All right! We're breaking through. <strong>Distract them... however you can!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Gotcha!</strong>" The rest of them ran to their left, attacking the left flank. The giant Castle Guard opened up its wings like a door keeper waiting for the ball to come his/her direction.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Castle Guard exploded and fell to the ground. Eunie created a ring that healed the others while they faced other levnises and soldiers in all directions. Lanz and Mio each brought down a Levnis, Sena two soldiers, Noah one. Noah shouted, "<strong>Now's your chance! Move it, Ghondor!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Ghondor, Oggy, Aggy, and several other Lost Numbers trailed behind. Three Agnian soldiers brought up their muskets and shot at Ghondor; Lanz arrived in time to block the bullets. They continued running without looking back. Taion knocked the three soldiers down.</p>
<p>As she continued, more soldiers with more muskets arrived; the last layer before she could move towards Patulia Bay. She was prepared for a fight, but Oggy and Aggy moved in front, urging her, "Ma'am! We'll handle this!" "Get through here and you're free! Quick!"</p>
<p>She couldn't accept that, "What?! <strong>Yeah, screw that</strong>! Now I'm supposed to leave you behind as well?!"</p>
<p>"The Ouroboros candidates are our future!" "Come now... You must move!"</p>
<p>"But, why...?"</p>
<p>Both walked forward slowly towards the soldiers. They were ready to die for the greater cause, happily replying, "Heheh. It's the prison food. Gone and developed a taste for it." "And the beds are actually halfway decent. It's fine, don't you worry about us." The two dashed towards the gunning soldiers, swirling their flaming sticks in front to deflect the bullets. Ghondor looked at them sadly for a moment,</p>
<p>With a sad tone, "Aggy... Oggy..." Then, strengthening her tone, she called out to the rest of the Lost Numbers, "Move it! Don't look back!"</p>
<p>"<strong>GHONDOR!!!</strong>" Shania had her eyes on her all the time. She stopped and looked back at her, whom was standing on a ledge alone.</p>
<p>"Shania... Urgh...!" Now's not the time to stop. She continued her escape. Shania couldn't do anything else to stop her.</p>
<p>"This isn't over... You'll see soon enough!"</p>
<p>Back at central scene, the Ouroboros fell another Castle Guard. Panting furiously, they sheathed their weapons.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Ugh... Thought we'd never make it, but this looks hopeful?"</p>
<p>Taion wasn't as bright, "I wonder."</p>
<p>Noah: "There's still a few left."</p>
<p>Sena: "Oh, yeah, and two Moebius!" Now that N and M prepared to get their hands dirty themselves.</p>
<p>Lanz: "And all this without killing... Doubt we'll have such an easy time with these..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah... but we helped Ghondor escape!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Right. And that was priority number one."</p>
<p>Manana rebutted, "But-but... Other people all got left behind! This not huge mess?" Oggy and Aggy, together with several Lost Numbers, stood against the remaining Agnian soldiers. Corpses lie around them.</p>
<p>Taion shared his logic, "They'll be fine. Unlike us fugitives, they're useful assets. They can still surrender... and be put to work again."</p>
<p>Noah: "Still... The more that can escape, the better."</p>
<p>Mio: "So... one last stand?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Aw, yeah!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Bring it!" They turned their attention to the approaching N and M.</p>
<p>N: "Hmph... Hm hm hm hm hm hm hm.... Such nonsense. Your idiocy knows no bounds."</p>
<p>Noah: "What's so funny?"</p>
<p>"This suits me just fine! You will make an adequate feast. Moebius will savor <em>every one of you, <strong>rest assured!</strong></em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Talking about us like we're food? Well, <em>sorry mate</em>, <strong>but we bite back!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Right! You'll be going hungry today! We fought so hard for this. We're not giving it up, <strong>not ever!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh? You still intend to resist? Against these odds?" They stopped after the group withdrew their weapons.</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>"You think you can defeat me?"</p>
<p>"We will. <strong>For us to move forward, we must!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Very well. I will demonstrate beyond all doubt. There is no possible future for you in this world." He was prepared to withdraw his 'Lucky Seven' from its shackles, but M walked forward.</p>
<p>M: "Let me handle this."</p>
<p>N: "You want to...? That's a surprise."</p>
<p>"I need to show them." N turned his attention to the group while M continued, "Make them realize just how powerless they truly are. Just as <em>we</em>, were once <em>'persuaded'</em>."</p>
<p>Noah heard their words, had more questions, "Who are they?"</p>
<p>N gave up withdrawing his weapons, agreed with M, "Hm... All right. Do as you will." He turned around and make space for the battlefield.</p>
<p>"Thank you... N. Huh.{{footnote: A relieved breath.}}" She slowly eyed through the members of the group, one by one.</p>
<p>Mio: "My other... self."</p>
<p>A purple shockwave originated from M pushed its boundaries and shook the group. As if losing everyone in sight, Mio was now alone with M, the latter had her eyes closed. Mio was gazing deeply at her statically for a few moments before gasping, as if some shocking information reached her mind. She stood up slowly, looked at M, whom eyes was still closed. Slowly, M raised her head, the momentary darkness that blinds while she opened her eyes; the surrounding buildings blurry in the background -- only Mio was in focus. Their eyes met as if tacit information were exchanged. Tears start aggregating and overflowing on M's eyes. Mio quietly gasped as she noticed the tears that slid down M's cheek, made a thud as it hit the dirt below. Mio squinted, her will unwavering.</p>
<p>"Tch h h h..." Noah appearing out of nowhere, shielded Mio behind him, voicing to M, "I need to know...!" Mio looked away; she evade looking at Noah's back.</p>
<p>M: "Go on?" Mio's head dropped even lower, looking on the ground, as if she don't want anybody to look into her eyes.</p>
<p>"Why...? Why do you look exactly like we do? <strong>Who are you people?!</strong>" All the while, N kept quiet, watching the scene unfolding{{footnote: Oh, what a view if he'd popcorn.}}</p>
<p>"Well now. If... If, you can defeat us in combat, you will see for yourselves." She called her weapons, exactly like Mio's twin rings, except the ring color isn't bright yellow but purple dark, like Moebius's flames. "The truth! Why is it we stoke... the flames of war!" Her vision glided through the rest of the group, whom had joined in on Noah and Mio.</p>
<p>Taion remarked, "I don't know that I can bear to hurt her."</p>
<p>Eunie reprimanded, "I can, she's Moebius!"</p>
<p>Noah: "We have to win. Even if she does look... <strong>like Mio!</strong>" All the time her head was looking on the ground. He didn't look back, probably he can't, given his enemy was stronger and he'd to be scrupulous.</p>
<p>Sena: "So then..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Gloves off..." Noah approved of his remark. They prepared for battle. Mio finally raised her head, prepared for battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>After M slid backwards, she launched a purple shockwave directed at Noah. Taion don't see what's with the wave, was concentrated on getting a hit at her, dashed past Noah. His attention suddenly turned to Taion. Just as he was about to launch his Mondo, Noah slashed his sword at him. "Gahhh" He dodged just in time, but the group wasn't sure what had happened. As he dodged, "N-Noah?! Wh-what are you attacking me for? Why would you-" Seeing that dodging doesn't help, he used his Mondo to knock Noah back.</p>
<p>The purple flow disappeared as Noah regained consciousness with a gasp. Lanz hadn't realized his state changed, shouted at him, "<strong>Noah! What are you doing?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"What do you- Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>You just took a swipe at Taion! The snuff were you thinking?!</strong>"</p>
<p>With a quivering voice, he was equally shocked, "<em>I went... for Taion?!</em>"</p>
<p>While they were figuring out what had happened, M launched another shockwave, this time targeting Mio. "Urrggggggaaaaa!!!" Her blade slashed at Noah; he was alerted, seeing her launching at him.</p>
<p>"M-Mio!" Now, the group was more confused. While Noah and Mio were exchanging hits, the group watched in awe, trying to figure out what had happened. "S-stop this! Mio!" She wasn't listening.</p>
<p>With a final repel, she was dazzled, questioned, "What just... What...?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "I don't understand..."</p>
<p>Since they're not the ones doing this themselves, and since it's not just Noah himself being crazy, Noah figured out who was the source. "Oh no..." He turned his head to M, "So this is her power?"</p>
<p>M: "Congratulations. You figured it out quickly."</p>
<p>"Of course." Recalling to previous Moebius's fight, "In every fight we've had, you've always used some special power against us." Fingernails in D{{footnote: Unclear what's his special power...}}, Flame Clock healing with K, mud puppet with Joran, not to speak the Interlinking of the ugliest.</p>
<p>"Exactly. I have... the power to override your pitiful consciousness."</p>
<p>Eunie, in a pitiful tone, "She's using us like bloody puppets?! Ugh. So that's her game!"</p>
<p>"Once I've taken over your mind, you are absolutely helpless. A blind passenger." As she finished her words, she took control of Eunie. She made a dash for Lanz.</p>
<p>"Ugh..." Sena was frozen from helping out.</p>
<p>"Rrrrgaaaah!!!" After a few exchanges, she prepared her rifle and aimed it at Lanz, launching a shot that blasted his shield. "Aaaaahhhh!!" She gasped after that, regaining her mind.</p>
<p>Noah, seeing that Lanz was unhurt, turned his attention at M, questioned, "How can we stop her?"</p>
<p>"Ahahahahah.... Well, aren't you putting up a strong front." Looking at Sena, she asked, "What are you doing?" Sena had her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>"It's futile." She was now under control, slammed her hammer at Eunie, her strength so strong it broke Eunie's defense.</p>
<p>"S-stop it, Sena!" Luckily, Lanz could block her smashes.</p>
<p>As she regained control, "Uh... D-did I...?"</p>
<p>Now that Noah was under control, even his mouth was under control -- the same words coming from both their mouths slightly out of sync, "I was hoping you would have figured it out by now, but I'm afraid simply closing your eyes... is not enough to escape my power." She held the handle of her hammer in front of her face, trembling.</p>
<p>Lanz gritted his teeth as if he noticed something, commented, "Just had another brilliant idea." He pointed his broadsword at Noah.</p>
<p>M was curious, "Oh?"</p>
<p>"The whole time you're hijacking our bodies, <strong>you ain't moving!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hmm?" So what?</p>
<p>Pointing the sword at her, "Which means... We've just gotta go after you <strong>instead</strong>!" She made a dash towards M, but Eunie blasted a hit from behind and sent him on to the floor. Too slow, Lanz! "Eu-Eunie... What the-"</p>
<p>"Huh? No, it wasn't me!"</p>
<p>M: "Too bad. I was over here." That was her voice with Taion's.</p>
<p>Lanz: "What?" The mondo launched at him as he shielded it. Noah sliced through the Mondo flow as he tried to get Taion back,</p>
<p>"Sorry, Taion! I need you to stop now."</p>
<p>As if he had regained consciousness, "N-Noah, it's me!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Taion</strong>!?" He stopped his sword in its track, seeing his innocent facial expression.</p>
<p>That innocence turned into a grim, "I lied." He, or rather, she, blasted the Mondo at Noah, sending him high into the air and landed on Lanz's chest.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Well, spark. This isn't going very bloody well, is it?" Taion gasped as he regained control.</p>
<p>M: "Hahaha." Now, it's Mio's turn.</p>
<p>Eunie: "You've gotta be..."</p>
<p>"She's got Mimi!" Mio sheathed her weapon and slowly walked towards the group, opening her arms as if to embrace, while M (and Mio) continued speaking,</p>
<p>"Come. Cut her down."</p>
<p>"What?!"</p>
<p>"It's an easy win. You need only take her life." Noah gritted at such words, lowering his sword slowly. N watched as if he'd been reminded with his own past, the lost of hope. M continued, "You see the irony? Funny how you've slain so many... to extend your own short lifespans, yet your friends' lives now chain you down, dulling your blades' edges. You can't do it, can you? Pathetic. Then your death will be slow and painful. Your dear friend here shall slice you to pieces, until you perish!"</p>
<p>Weapons back in hand, she started fighting Noah and Lanz. Eunie launched a shot from behind Lanz, making him lost his balance. Sena then smashed at Eunie. The mondo cut through Sena's hammer, while Lanz slashed at Taion. Mio brought out the big gun -- in the Interlinked form, Mio's Ouroboros came at Lanz.</p>
<p>"Sena!" Only Ouroboros power could match Ouroboros. They immediately interlinked to defend. Eunie and Taion also interlinked. A match so complicated guessing who's who is going on, as different people took control of their Ouroboros form, different people under mind control, and no one to trust. As the dust faded, all interlink canceled, they were already panting heavily. They not only had to watch out for their real enemy, but watching each other as well, no longer trusting their back.</p>
<p>Taion remarked, "We don't know when she'll take over, or whose body she'll hijack... Despite that, by the time we detect her attack it's already..." As if something clicked in his head, "<strong>Detect...?That's it! Detection!</strong>" He launched his Mondo  into the air, surrounding them in a dome shape.</p>
<p>Sena: "Taion? What are you-?"</p>
<p>Pushing his glasses up and put on a show, "The Moebius..." He closed his eyes, trying to connect with his Mondo (which was swirling around) as if to detect something, and suddenly he shouted, "<strong>is you!</strong>" He sent his Mondo at Noah. He was correct. Noah and M's voice gasped at the same time as Noah knelt on the ground.</p>
<p>"Wh-what's... Ergh!" He held his hand over his injured shoulders.</p>
<p>Taion calmly continued, "Sorry, Noah."</p>
<p>"Taion? What's..."</p>
<p>Turning his attention at M, he saw M also grabbing her own shoulder, commented, "Our attacks... They seem to affect her real body as well."</p>
<p>"Was she controlling me?" To which he nodded.</p>
<p>"Indeed, <em>but now I know her secret.</em>" Shouting to the rest of the group, "Listen up! My Mondo will mark the target for you!"</p>
<p>Lanz was impressed, "Oh yeah?" Hope was back!</p>
<p>"Yes. The only option right now is for us to attack! Trust me... I can guarantee that it will deal damage to her!"</p>
<p>Noah: "I hear you. <strong>Eunie!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah?"</p>
<p>"You're... Eunie, right?" Just how much it takes to lose trust!</p>
<p>"Better believe it! Can't you tell by my smile?!"</p>
<p>"Good then. We need you to heal us up, after we take damage. <strong>Stay strong</strong>!"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got ye! Healing's on me."</p>
<p>"<strong>Let's go!</strong>" Second round!</p>
<hr />
<p>M heavily panted as the fight was no longer in her favor. The Ouroboros wasn't easy either, keeping their attention from slacking off. Mio looked at M for a while; their eyes met secretly, before she looked down on the ground, wasn't sure what she was thinking of.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Noah felt the throbbing headache. He immediately turned his attention to where the Golden Consul was standing. A purple slash cut through the ground, drawing a line between M and the Ouroboros, temporarily disarmed the Mondo's array, while sending dust that enshrouded its vicinity.</p>
<p>M, seeing that N had her back, fell down to the ground on one knee, another in a twisted position. She had enough strength to peer over her shoulder; "N..." He walked into the scene calmly, stood beside her and ordered,</p>
<p>"That's enough. Get back." His eyes squeezed in a look that accepted no negotiations.</p>
<p>"As you say." As she stood up, she brought her mask back online and walked out of the scene. N slightly pulled his sword out of the scabbard a few inches, immediately releasing an energy so strong it cleared the dust, revealing their new enemy, before tucking it back.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Now it's Noah we're dealing with?"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's not me.</strong>"</p>
<p>"I know that! Just sayin'."</p>
<p>Lanz: "You know, this is getting ridiculous. <strong>I don't get any of this nonsense!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion warned, "M's only stepping back. She could <em>still</em> use her powers. Just keep an eye on how the Mondo act."</p>
<p>Sena: "Yeah, will do!"</p>
<p>Words in his thoughts: "<em>A Moebius with my face... Is it something to do with how Moebius and Ouroboros have fought... over the ages?</em>" Something seemed to strike his mind; he saw a dark glow and purple smoke that enshrouded N, and his eyes in Moebius's red. As his vision blurred, he shook his head to clear it up, "<em>Need to stay focused. One little mistake, and it's over.</em>"</p>
<p>Third round!</p>
<hr />
<p>Without even pulling his sword, the momentum that his sword gathered is so strong it's enough to distort the environment{{footnote: Just like the water vapor in a heating sun after a heavy rain.}}. Eunie's Ouroboros was shooting at him; he closed his eyes, jumped up and unleashed his sword. "Aw, come on... Urggggaaaaahhhh!!!!" Immediately, she shattered into pieces, each falling back to the ground. N sheathed his sword back into the scabbard.</p>
<p>"Eunie!!! Urggaaaaaahhhh!!!" Lanz, being worried, took control from Sena while dashing towards N, still in mid-air. His punch made not a scratch on his scabbard, nor does N obeys the Newton's third law: he doesn't move an inch with applied force mid-air, where friction is nil! "Yaaaaaarggghhhh!!!" Several blows exchanged mid-air and his shield broke down. N grabbed Lanz's Ouroboros by its neck and threw it on to the ground below.</p>
<p>"Try some of this!" Taion took control from Eunie and swirled his Mondo around N, whom made it back on to the ground, gathered into a ball encircling him, and bringing him up slightly above the ground. "Eat it!" The explosion sent burnt Mondo and dust that enshrouded their view on N's status. "Did it work?"</p>
<p>As the dust cleared, N was unscathed. "Can't be... Not a scratch?!" Taion hadn't had time to perform subsequent measures when he was sliced; he disintegrated once more upon N returning his sword into the scabbard.</p>
<p>"Taion! Eunie!" Sena and Noah were running towards N. With the back of his sword, he easily blocked Sena's hammer and disintegrate it into pieces. After Sena rolled out of the scene, Noah tried slashing, but was too slow. Those that N don't think he wanted to dodge{{footnote: Or maybe that he can't without maintaining his posture.}} he blocked with his sword by moving the minimal distance required. As Mio took control towards the sliding-back N, he slashed off her feet "Ahhh urrrrggg ahhhh uhhhhh..." She rolled and fell.</p>
<p>N turned his attention to Mio's Ouroboros after sheathing his sword. She was struggling to get up; Noah took control in the moment. "After all that, he hasn't even had to transform... That's insane...!"</p>
<p>HIs body started to glow red hot, steam emanating from the Ouroboros Core as he finished his sentence. He looked at his own body, realizing his time was almost up. The beeping sound started warning him to cancel the Interlink. N had the patience to explain what was happening, "Ouroboros and Moebius both... manifest outwards from their core. So long as the core is intact... you can slice off as many limbs as you like. They will keep growing back...{{footnote: Taion's leg and all of Sena's limbs hadn't yet grow back, but they were already glowing red hot.}} Yet, at the cost of vast energy consumption. Of course, this cuts down the time you can stay in that form. <em>You're at your limit.</em>"</p>
<p>As he finished his sentence, he dashed so quickly at Noah's Ouroboros, still attending to his own body, and performed a slice so fast we don't see the sword. "YAAAAAAAAHHHH!!!" Noah's Ouroboros detached as it launched itself high into the air like a rocket, disintegrating (its interlink) mid-air. M closed her eyes to keep away from the inhumane scene. "Urrrrrgghhhh" "Ahhhhhhh" Both dropped to the ground some distance apart.</p>
<p>Noah was struggling to get up on his feet, still questioning, "<em>H-how...? Our power... There's really nothing we can do to beat him?! Mio... Everybody's hopes and dreams... They die here? Uhuh...</em>" He struggled on his feet, but it seems he lost his hope simultaneously.</p>
<p>N gripped the sword's handle, turned around at him and remarked, "Your hope is a fool's hope. And I will end your dreams... now!" He pulled his sword and launched a purple slash at Noah. No others could shield for him; for they were struggling to get up themselves. The slash sent him into the air, and we could see some motes floating where he was injured.</p>
<p>Still in (Taion's) Ouroboros form, Eunie called out, "N-Noah!!!" They watched as he fell onto the ground. N didn't kill him. Slowly walking towards him, he commented,</p>
<p>"Power is for those who face reality. And I, having <strong>witnessed countless realities, preside in a world beyond your ken!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Reality, you say?"</p>
<p>"Huuuuuuuahhhhhh!!!!" Meanwhile, Mio had gotten up on her feet, dashing towards N; her anger at what he had done to Noah is her strength. "Urggghhh" With eyes wide opened, Noah could only see her brutally being knocked back, gliding across the air, losing her grip on the ring.</p>
<p>"<strong>MIO!!!</strong>" He got hold of her shoulder and waist as he tried to help her up, "<strong>Mio!! You OK?! Mio?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I... I'll live..." As they looked up, N was standing a few feet{{footnote: One isn't US resident, so one isn't sure how 'feet' measures, but one assumed the length of our real 'feet', and the vague 'a few' signifies error rate between a small foot or a big foot you have.}} in front of them. His attention was on such protection Noah offered to Mio; perhaps it had brought unwanted memories that he had long buried. The group watched the sadistic look in his eyes, unsure what he would do to them next.</p>
<p>At the other side, Sena's Ouroboros were crazily beeping with their limbs still detached. "Mimi..." She recalled how they accompanied each other, their bits and pieces together. "Lanz..."</p>
<p>"Mm?"</p>
<p>"Sorry. Could I ask for some help here?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. No problem. <strong><em>This is the time, huh? For us to really shine.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah. Right.</strong>" They overclocked to force their limbs grow back.</p>
<p>"Let's go!" Lanz first took control finishing his words, "Yeeerrrrraaaggghhh!!!!" Even while he was thinking, he had time to notice his incoming. He dodged his slow punches; he kept changing direction just to re-aim at N. "Fire and sparks! Quit it with the bleeping!"</p>
<p>Noah and Mio watched in awe what they were doing, "<strong>Lanz! Sena! Cancel the interlink!!! You're at your limit!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh, believe us."</p>
<p>Sena took over, hammering N: "<strong>We knew that from the start!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hmph." While N was flying backwards from the shockwave that Sena sent onto the ground, Lanz took control and got behind him in the direction he was flying, opening his arms and embraced him within his arms.</p>
<p>"<strong>Got you now, scum!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urgh!!!" Lanz put one hand around N's neck, gripped him hard like hugging him, and put another hand onto that arm to lock it tight. N tried to pulled his hands away, but it was too tight. Lanz then jumped into the air like a rocket launching high up onto the air.</p>
<p>"<strong>Lanz!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sorry. This sorta stuff... It's about all I'm good for really."</p>
<p>"<strong>What are you talking about? What are you going to-?!</strong>" He took his hands off Mio and stood up, Mio slowly standing beside him.</p>
<p>"<strong>Sena!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Mimi, remember what you said? You always told me to never stop being myself. I finally get it. What you meant by that. <strong><em>This is me.</em></strong> So don't give up yet. This'll buy you some extra time... Use it!"{{footnote: Taion could do nothing, given him at his limit too. Riku and Manana could only took one step forward, gasped at the situation they're facing, about to lose two companions. M couldn't look up at the scene.}}</p>
<p>"<strong>Stop this! I don't want any of your time!!! Just come back, Sena!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz examined the situation and reminded Sena, "We're too close. <strong>Take us outta here!</strong>"</p>
<p>She nodded, "<strong>OK!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!</strong>" They kicked mid-air and launched themselves higher into mid-air.</p>
<p>N: "What are they-"</p>
<p>More and more black fog got absorbed into Lanz's Ouroboros. "<strong>YYYYYAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!</strong>" They zipped past the highest point of the Castle, not looking back.</p>
<p>As tears aggregate in her eyes, she spoke her last words, "<em>Thank you, Mimi...</em>"</p>
<p>The explosion never happened. Some bright light flooded the screen and they were forced to cancel their interlink mid-air. Both were shocked at what just happened, "Urgghhh..."</p>
<p>"Aww, too baaaad. You were so close." In between them, another moebius holding on to a staff with a gyroscope at its tip, having a ball of purple energy encased in between the gyroscope rings, appeared.{{footnote: If you'd read Eunie's side story, you'd know this girl was X.}} Both dropped on to the ground below.</p>
<p>"AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!" Taion used the remaining time to force grow his limbs back, sent his Mondo as a layer of cushion just a few meters above ground where they were dropping before finally cancelling their interlink. Effetely, both drop face down onto the ground, totally out of energy. The Mondo ball disappeared not long later.</p>
<p>Seeing that they're fine, Mio dropped to the ground. Noah got hold of her shoulders and watch together with her.</p>
<p>N, now back on the ground, the other female Moebius walking towards him. He was clearly annoyed, questioned her, "X... What are you doing?"</p>
<p>What had been done had not been appreciated. Pointing the staff at N, she complaint, "<strong>Hey, I just saved your life!</strong> Could I get just a little gratitude here?"</p>
<p>Focusing on the ball of energy in the middle of the gyroscope staff, he asked, "Z's orders?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much. Heheh." Meanwhile, Z was sitting in the theatre, watching in remote, emotionless.</p>
<p>Taion finally got strength to stood up, "<strong>Another Moebius?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "X, is it? The Interlink... So this is her doing?"</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Noah and Mio was dashing forward, shouting, "<strong>Lanz!</strong>" "<strong>Sena!</strong>" "<strong>Are you OK?!</strong>" Arriving at where Lanz had stood up, he was angry he had not been able to buy time for them.</p>
<p>"Sparks' sake..."</p>
<p>Mio turned towards Sena and hugged her, glad to had her back alive, "Sena..."</p>
<p>"Sorry, Mimi... I couldn't... pull it off."</p>
<p>"It's OK... Forget about that..."</p>
<p>While they were welcoming the two back, N step forward and interfered. Sena noticed his approaching. With X backing him up, he spoke, "Well now. I apologize for that little disturbance. It won't happen again." Noah wasn't sure what that means. He continued, "You'll notice your powers have now been fully sealed. Give it up. Your chances of victory <em>are nil</em>." He recalled his sword and ready to grab the handle if they were to rebut.</p>
<p>Noah: "Ngh..." He (and the others) tried to summon his blades, only to had empty hands. In the screen on the Iris, the sword dissipate whenever he tried to summon it. Shockingly, he now understood what it meant by 'being sealed'. "Wha... My Blade... It's gone!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wh-what? How?!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Impossible... Never heard of a Blade failing!"</p>
<p>N slashed towards them; they were undamaged. Then, they heard a shout from behind; turning and saw a Lost Number injured.</p>
<p>"Anton!" The others quickly got to his feet.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Piece of sh-!"</p>
<p>"Hahahahah.... Ah, it seems you were hoping they would escape. Sadly, things didn't quite pan out your way, did they?"</p>
<p>Lanz, with gritted teeth, "Because you cut him down!" M, watching their exchanges, slightly looked down. Mio's eyes were unfluttered{{footnote: Not a word in the dictionary, just "not fluttered" is the meaning.}}.</p>
<p>Aggy: "Sorry, Noah. Guess we were dead weight after all!"{{footnote: Actually, one searched online for who's Aggy, who's Oggy, given that one still don't know until one searched. So, the one with dark hair (the most noticeable difference) is Aggy, and the one green hair Oggy.}}</p>
<p>N prepared for another slash, "Did I not tell you? There's no hope. Now witness the result." The group prepared for him to slash at them, executing them therefore. Moments of concerns passed as they concentrated in silence. He thought for a really long time, with a really long pause in between, until he gave it up, announcing instead, "<em>A sideshow...!</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "What...?"</p>
<p>"I've just thought of the most wonderful little amusement." He turned his attention to Mio.</p>
<p>"Huh..." Perhaps she had read his mind? We don't know... Her eyes contained sorrow.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note on Environment:</strong> Soldiers traversing up and down a dark central alleyway that have occasional lights mounted on to the beams. Another scene: more soldiers walking around a booth that looks like a reception, though no one sit behind the desk. There were doors 'behind' the reception, with some soldiers sitting by a table and speaking to each other. Yet another scene: on an empty tiled ground, buildings surrounded the empty space. Fire torches lined both side of the central alleyway leading to an elevated stage at the front. More pillars grown behind the elevated stage. We could see this is a zoom in version of <strong>Agnus Castle Region.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>A soldier shoved Noah into the cell. Eunie, Taion, Riku and Manana, Lanz, and Sena were already inside. The gate closed in front of his eyes. In another cell, Mio faced the other side of the door, locked up by herself. The soldier leave thereafter finishing their business.{{footnote: In hindsight, this is where the first scene on one's note on environment came: to both side of the alleyway lined the heavily-guarded prisons that locked the group.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Seconds by seconds, minutes by minutes, Noah forcefully shook and punch the metal grate, to no avail.</p>
<hr />
<p>He desperately punched and punched and shoved himself on the jail door, "<strong>Sparks! It's just a metal grate. Why can't I break it?!</strong>"{{footnote: At least in this page, bold means strongly expressed, loud, heightened voice/tone; while italics meant soft, desperate, desolate, crying, loss of hope; or if used by the enemy, italics meant softly spoken. It if was both italicized and boldened, it was just one highlighting the phrase worth writing down in your diary!}}</p>
<p>As the wrestling continued, Taion had had enough, got up and asked, "<strong>Cool it, Noah!</strong> They've stripped us of our powers. There's no way for us to break it! Just give it a rest."</p>
<p>"How can I 'give it a <strong>rest</strong>'?!" He continued etching out every strength he had battling the door as he replied, "We have to get through! <strong>We have to get Mio out...!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Another afternoon.</p>
<p>Beams from the evening sun entered the alleyway, casting it a foggy presence . Noah heard footsteps, looked up and saw N stopping outside, looking down on him like a master looking at a slave, "Surprisingly well-behaved. I half-expected you to have blown a hole in the wall by this point. Or what? <em>Have you resigned yourself wholly to your plight, knowing the extent of my power?</em>"</p>
<p>"Did you come to gloat? Where's Mio?" Noah angrily looked at him as his breathed shallowly and heavily.</p>
<p>"The girl, you'll find... is in the cell beside you."</p>
<p>"Huh?" He was surprised. Despite all the punching and kicking, she didn't made a sound.</p>
<p>"Call out her name, why don't you? Your voice, at least, should reach." His teeth gritted at such cruelty he put him and her in. N continued, ignoring his anger, "Oh, I see. You still cling to a sliver of hope.{{footnote: He turned to face the window, back facing Noah.}} <strong>You recall</strong>... I wanted to stage a little sideshow. You expecting applause? <em>It's the Homecoming.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Everyone in the cell was shocked hearing what he'd decided to do.</p>
<p>"Hrmph... I'm glad you catch on quick. With the eclipse... one month from now. <em>The girl will meet her long-awaited end.</em> <strong>Why don't we honor it at the Castle?</strong>{{footnote: The 3rd scene being shown from translator's note earlier. What we can see now that we can't just now, is Swordmarch in the distance.}} Make it a day <em>to remember</em>?" N turned to face Noah with a grim{{footnote: His hands like a V-shape and shaking them to show strength and elation.}}, "<strong>Well?! Does that not</strong> <em>please you?</em> <strong>What a magnificent sideshow it will be! HUHHAHAHAHAHA!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah lost his composure and jumped on his feet, hands against the metal grate, shaking it. As he walked closer to Noah, he continued,</p>
<p>"Oh, yes... I almost forgot to tell you something. You are now aware of the cycle of rebirth, yes? There is an exception."</p>
<p>"Huh...?" N put his mouth near his ears and whispered loudly.</p>
<p>"<em>Those whose flame is snuffed out during a Homecoming... will not return.</em>" His iris trembling as it grew to its max strain. The others were so shocked they jumped on their feet. On the other cell, Mio was still standing, back facing the cell door, looking upwards as she reminisced something we don't know.</p>
<p>Noah's eyes flickered as he tried to digest the news. Gathering his anger, "<strong>You monster!!!</strong>" He punched N on the shoulder, but immediately  "Urrrrgggaaahhhh..." as N jabbed him in his thigh with the back of his sword.</p>
<p>"<em>Hehehehe.... So weak.</em> Amusingly so... Right now, all of you put together... <em>don't have the strength of a single soldier.</em>" Putting his hands and caressing it, "Not even these flimsy iron bars... <em>yield to your efforts. Try all you like, but you cannot escape. No amount of toil will help you there.</em>"</p>
<p>Still groaning in pain, he gave N a stern look.</p>
<p>"You feel the anguish? <em>Crippling despair?</em> That is the hubris. <em>Of fools who cling blindly to their hopes... only to find them dashed on the rocks. Of dreamers, crushed under the sheer weight of reality. Of abject failures.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Another night.</p>
<p>Repeated punches at the door. "<strong>Come on! Come on! COME ON!!!</strong>" His knuckles tainted with blood, but he won't stop.</p>
<p>"<strong>That's enough!</strong> You're just gonna break your hands!" Lanz had grabbed his wrist.</p>
<p>Desperately, he forcefully pulled his hands out of the grip, "<strong>I don't care! I'll shatter every bone in my body... if that's what it takes!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Just stop! Please!</strong>"</p>
<p>That voice is more useful than his. Noah immediately dashed towards the cell door, grabbed on the metal grate, pushed his head against it looking right, trying to see the shadow of the beauty he'd tried to reach all along. With a desolating tone, he softly asked, "<em>Mio? A-are you OK?</em>"</p>
<p>A moment of silence awaited as the group had their ears opened up, listening.{{footnote: Just for your info, the distance between the two adjacent cells were several meters apart: the sheer thickness of the wall between, though!}} She was sitting on the ground, legs pulled back onto her chest, arms wrapped around it, and softly replied, "<em>Don't worry about me. I'm... totally fine.</em> I've made... my peace. Even if I can never leave here, I'm content. I'll live on in others. Knowing that is enough for me... Please... don't worry." She slowly lowered her head into her laps, to silence her tears that, if he heard it, would be agitated.</p>
<p>Tears were aggregating in the eyes of those on the other cells. Taion sat back down besides Eunie. Noah felt his heart ripped apart, "<em>Mio...</em>" If you were never given the freedom to choose, the only thing you can do is to smile and walk the path contently.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sliding into the cell was some red (tomato/carrot/whatever) soup, a dome-shaped bread, and a spoon on a tray. Manana, seeing that food arrived, brought it and put it in front of Noah, whom was looking down, his back against the wall in a meditative state. Hearing the delivery, he looked up and saw her starry eyes. He had no appetite, shook his head and immersed himself back in meditative state. Manana felt slightly down at his rejection; but she left it anyways and walked back to where she sat beside Riku. No one else were eating.</p>
<p>Lanz voiced out softly, "Hey... Why d'you think it is, that they look like Noah and Mio...?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Like I know! Why don't you ask 'em yourself?"</p>
<p>Sena: "When we kick the bucket, we're reborn in those cradles, right? Maybe it's... somehow connected to that?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "You think they're the same people? Is that <em>even</em> possible?"</p>
<p>Taion: "It's strange. Regardless, why would they do this? What possible purpose <strong>could all this serve</strong>? It's almost... like they're <strong>toying with us</strong> just for kicks."</p>
<p>Eunie remarked, recalled from her availability biases, "You know, they've all been like that. When they took away lives... it was like they were enjoying it."</p>
<p>Riku challenged that thought "That{{footnote: Oh my, Riku, you shouldn't say "That's"!!! Nopon had no "'s" in their dictionaries!}} really true?"</p>
<p>"Huh?" The group was confused. Even Noah.</p>
<p>"It seem natural <strong>to laugh</strong> when happy. And yet... N had sadness in eyes... <em>it seemed</em>.{{footnote: Remember, Riku is really skilled at looking into other people's eyes, or he wouldn't have knew Noah being able to call his blade while he visited him ages ago.}}"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Noah tried to recall what he saw.</p>
<p>Lanz didn't agreed with him, stood up with anger, "Like spark he did. He's Moebius. Our sworn... <em>enemy</em>."</p>
<hr />
<p>After Eunie slid the emptied tray out of their cell, she sighed, "Hmph... We really are hopeless. Can't believe we're stuck in here, behind these snuffin' bars." Even her hope started to wade.</p>
<p>Taion logically argued, "It wouldn't be much of a prison if they didn't perform that function."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Come on..."</p>
<p>"Hmph..."</p>
<p>Sena desolately questioned, "Was there even any point in all this? In everything we've done?" The group philosophically thought about her questioning; one of the ultimate question that struck their purpose. Would they keep on walking, or would they change course? There was a long pause in between until Noah stood up, affirming her,</p>
<p>"Course there was."</p>
<p>"Huh?" She watched him walked towards a wall. They wanted to know.</p>
<p>"At least... We gave them hope." Above where he was facing was a giant barred window that gave view of the starry night sky. The confidence in his tone lost its composure as he felt the pain growing within him, "Urgh..." He gave several punches at the wall.</p>
<p>Lanz didn't stop him, shared his thought, "At first... even when Guernica said... he was six times older, it didn't click. <strong><em>Past ten years was pure greed</em></strong>, I thought. <strong>But now...</strong> <em>I'm scraping... for whatever I can get.</em>" The group looked down silently, as if to agree, to want to hold on to their lives as long as possible, to live in the now.</p>
<p>With wavering breath, Noah shook his head{{footnote: Unsure what he was thinking. Maybe fighting between thought?}}.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the City, by a flying ship.</p>
<p>Soldiers assembled in front of Ghondor. The Ouroboros candidates nodded at her after she finished her speech. Then, they dashed off in several directions, leaving her alone. Monica approached her, questioned her sternly, "<strong><em>What</em> are you doing?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?" She looked at to see whom was approaching, only to tilt her head back down, "<em>Oh, the Bitchqueen herself</em>."</p>
<p>She don't care about that label, "<strong>Where do you think you're going?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Where d'you think I'm going?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You know I can't allow this.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>'Scuse me?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's a direct order. Don't be stupid!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Whatever...</strong> <em>Up yours.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Look, the Castle is on maximum alert now. Are you in that much of a hurry to get back behind bars?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Tch..."</p>
<p>"This ain't like the time we ambushed Keves, when we <strong>had the element of surprise.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>After all they did for me, I can't just leave 'em! We don't have time for this!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>And I'm telling you its suicide!</strong>" She gave her a shocking breath. "<strong>Noah entrusted everything to us. Hope... The future...</strong>" Looking at the Cloud Keep key which she wore back around her neck, Monica continued, "<strong>Get that through your skull!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ugh..."</p>
<p>Some purple particles gathered, and someone teleported inside the City, probably a Moebius. Monica was shocked to see his/her arrival. "<strong>You...?!</strong>" Ghondor turned to look who (s)he was.</p>
<hr />
<p>The moonlight shone into Mio's cell. She stood up, walked under the light, and looked out the window. The half-moon (left side dark) that hung brightly on the sky kept her time, kept her companion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Here I am, staring at my own palms... I feel the warmth of your hand...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Not Noah alone, but the whole group helping to bang at the metal grate, trying their hardest to free themselves. More than half the moon shone.</p>
<hr />
<p>Trying to pull the grate apart; they even managed to get Sena on to the window high above, where she tried to pull it apart, or maybe squeezing through, to no avail. She dropped down thereafter; Lanz caught on to her. Three-quarter of the moon brightly lit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I'd be, forever by your side, protecting you, assuming that's what you wanted too...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Tired, some gripped onto the metal grate, while the rest sat down, too tired to try. Taion paced left and right, thinking of another solution. The full moon brightly hung on the sky.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lanz was the only one still punching the grate. The moon was nearly-full (right side dark).</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and Lanz used their elbow to bang against the grate. Lanz fell on his back and slept on the ground, hopeless of their effort. Noah tried harder. The moon was slightly more than half.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I had no clue, that we had nothing between us, perhaps, I was so scared to know the truth...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Even with both his knuckles bleeding, he continued banging against the grate unwaveringly. His eyes getting watery, he caught hold on the grate and dropped to the ground in a knelt position desolately, his hands lose force and dropped down, hanging.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now that you're gone, and yet your love is still, embracing me, I'm at a loss, I need you with me... It's like I'm drowning... as if I've lost the way... But you always appear... as if you guide my way...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>One evening. The group sat down in their thoughts. Eunie looked deeply on her past's dog tag. Taion was standing up, perhaps still thinking of what unthought ways there were to escape. Manana distributed food when the time arrived. Not even a nod, not even a look, not even a reaction from any one of them. She put the tray down anyways before wading her way back to her place.</p>
<p>Riku looked at their lost of hope; his eyes gleaned brightly, never losing hope. He was waiting, waiting, waiting... Noah hadn't yet understood.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I thought I could do it all, I had my confidence, but now I'm left alone, with no one by my end... I knew my faults... but I pretended I didn't know... I fear, I'm not the kind of man, you know...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Sena looked up and saw her approaching, softly called out, "Shania..."</p>
<p>Lanz unfriendlily asked, "What are you doing here?"</p>
<p>"Got a little update for you."</p>
<p>Eunie calmly remarked, "This will be good."</p>
<p>"The day your friend departs this world... What did you call it? Homecoming...? That's the day... I've decided to have myself killed too." She pointed at her iris; the thin flame clock glowed on her eyes. Her smile pretended everything was all right, but it only made Sena felt more in misery. She had lost her except the memories.</p>
<p>{{footnote: As she stood up.}}"Shania... Your Iris...!"</p>
<p>"Yep! This right here is proof that I've joined their ranks." As she turned and walked away, she finished her sentence, "And your little friend will vanish from this world forever. But... <em>I</em>... will be born once again! <strong>Just the way I should be!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hurgh!!!" Noah dashed at her and caught hold of the cell door, gritting his teeth at such attacks on his philosophy, or maybe her attacks on Mio.</p>
<p>"AHAHAHAHA!!!" She was elated at his reaction. "<strong>That's just the reaction I was hoping for. Ahh, it's beautiful.</strong> I hope I can make that face too... when I meet my enemies <strong>on the battlefield.</strong>"</p>
<p>Even Taion can't hear more, "Piss off, eyesore." Eunie stood up with him.</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you worry. I'll be gone soon. <em>Pretty much as soon as your friend will</em>. <strong>HAHAHAHAH!!!</strong>" This time, she's really leaving them alone.</p>
<p>Sena felt regretful, "It was so obvious, looking back. I knew that something was off about her. I knew deep down. I just... I didn't want to believe that we were the same..."{{footnote: Philosophically, in the real world outside fiction, you can't trust your memory. One could say, one knew deep down that Covid would spread to the whole world, after the last global epidemic hadn't spread for so long, to wipe out any risk we have, just like the stock market crashes every few decades at the very least to wipe out risk. But hey, one's memory had been playing trick on one -- it's called hindsight bias.}}</p>
<p>"You're not the same."</p>
<p>She rushed to the bars and asked, "Is that Mimi...?"</p>
<p>Sitting down in the arms-around-her-legs position, she looked up and recalled her memories with her, replying, "I was watching you. Trying so hard. You saved us so many times... never giving up. You helped us get here. Sometimes... you can be really hard on yourself. I think... <em>that's why you've always been so hungry, always striving for more.</em>"</p>
<p>Her tears started swelling up as she was getting recognized, what she'd hoped for long, "<em>Yeah...</em>"</p>
<p>"Come now... I know you've touched so many lives. I think... we've all seen that."</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah... Hrngh... Yeah. I know. I see it now... I'm sorry...</em>"</p>
<p>"Come on. You really need to stop saying that you're sorry."</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah... Sorry!</em>" Her tears slid down her cheeks and drop to the ground.</p>
<p>"It's all right. Don't give up." Looking out at the windows, the glimpse of light from the brightest star even outshone the moon, she softly announced, "<strong><em>Because time... is still on our side.</em></strong>" Half moon shone through the giant window (right side dark), slowly engulfing it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I now have the courage to, show you there is a way... You taught me silently, I know what you will say... And when I search for you, I see a guiding light, It's now so clear to me but you're still far away... A step away...</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Everyone sat quietly by a corner, except Noah by himself. Taion had one of his fingers caressing his Mondo, which laid on the floor.{{footnote: How did he hid it from the enemy's sight, or summon it? Probably it's not summoned but, like the Nimue's clock, it doesn't depend on the Iris. As on how he hid it, we don't know.}} Eunie tugged her legs up, elbow on her knees, making a diamond shape in between, her head on the back of her palm. Taion voiced out calmly, "<em>So then... Tomorrow</em>." That was a heavy topic. There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>"Do you think an off-seer... can ever reach others? You know... I thought... our lives were like our music... Always in our hands, under our control{{footnote: He look at his palm in the process.}}... I wasn't facing the truth." Looking out at the starry night sky, tone getting desolate, "<em>Even if I could reach people, I wouldn't be able to save them. I should've known that.</em> Pffff" He clenched his fist, gritted his teeth, tears aggregating at the tip of his eyes, "<em>It's unbearable... seeing lives slip away from you...</em> <strong>Even though they're right there... What am I even doing...</strong>" The others looked away as he weep.</p>
<p>"It's dark out, huh...? No moon." Mio's calm voice called a halt to the desolating moment.</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>" He turned and looked outside the window.</p>
<p>"But... the starlight... It's so nice and warm..."</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hey... When the two of us first met... You asked me if I wanted to survive."</p>
<p>He took a moment to recall, softly answered, "<em>Yeah.</em>"</p>
<p>"I replied... I didn't mind either way."</p>
<p>He slowly raised his heads in steps, as if his muscles twitched again and again, "<em>Yeah...</em>"</p>
<p>Mio took a few moments to muster her courage to voice her words, in contentment, "I'll correct that. Now I... want to live. <strong>To live, and learn... a whole lot more...</strong> <em>Noah...</em> There's so much for us to see..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." His eyes widened, "Finally... <strong><em>You called me by my name.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah... sorry..." she continued amidst his mixture of tears of relief and desolation, "I guess I felt that... <strong><em>if I did... my heart would downright break. Because... I'd be admitting the truth.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>"</p>
<p>"But you know, these feelings that grew within me... They're thanks to you." All the while he kept weeping on her words. She slowly rested her head on the wall and closed her eyes; the dim starlight caressed illumination on her silhouette, "That's why... <strong><em>you're not allowed to say... it's been for nothing. You've enriched my life, Noah.</em></strong> That's clear now."</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie cried out hearing their conversations, "Urgh!" Taion took repeated punch on the floor, feeling effete he can't do anything to release their situation. Sena was deep in tears. Even Lanz can't hold back. Manana hugged Riku from behind, both teary-eyed.</p>
<p>"You know... I don't want this to be it. <em>If I were given the chance...</em> <strong>If this road I have walked... were to keep on going...</strong> <strong><em>I'd like to spend that time... with my Noah.</em></strong>" She looked up, full of dreams, put up a thin smile before facing her inevitable.{{footnote: Like every other ones whom made it to their homecoming before her; they could do nothing but to embrace.}}</p>
<p>No longer holding it back, Noah put his palm on his forehead as tears slid down the side of his cheek. As he weep in the background, full of repentance, she looked out of the window, the stars that had accompanied her for so long.</p>
<hr />
<p>The morning light rose from the horizon{{footnote: The stars dimmed out from view.}}; the beam brightened the interior of the cell. Mio had her diary on her laps, filling in the last page of her life. As she sliced out the final diamond with her fountain pen, she gently caressed the final page of her calendar, looking attentively on the currently opened pages, and signified the end of her chapter by closing it.</p>
<hr />
<p>The moon almost entirely covering the sun. There's still some moment before their center meets. On the 2nd level of the elevated stage, there stood a new building, seemingly the Queen's throne. On both sides stood a row of Agnian soldiers, probably off-seers to sing the Homecoming melody. In front, in the direction facing the throne, on the left was X (with the staff) and Shania, on the right, N and M. Lined on the ground below were Agnian soldiers coming to watch the grand event. Several Levnises were at the side of the soldiers.</p>
<p>On the 1st level of the elevated stage, Noah and the others were escorted each by one Agnian soldiers to kneel before the 2nd level. His eyes like dead waters. Only Lanz and Eunie struggled a bit as they were forced to their position. Even Riku and Manana had electrical chains encircling them{{footnote: Dang, doesn't even restrict their hands nor wings nor feet, only use is for fashion.}}. No one spoke a word. Noah saw the smile{{footnote: Sorry, one can't find an adjective to describe it.}} on Shania's face, the calm sadness in N's eyes, and the unknown feelings hidden behind M's mask. His eyes still emanates anger at those who jailed him.</p>
<p>Roaring cheers and applauses brought him back to reality. "My Queen!"</p>
<p>"Your Majesty!"</p>
<p>They watched the Queen appeared on a platform on the throne, whom wore a mask, hands slightly opened as if to embrace her fellow citizens. The lot started chanting, "Queen Nia! Queen Nia! Queen Nia!"</p>
<p>Three chants and she raised her hands to silenced the soldiers, therefore begun her majestic speech: "Trace our ancestry back a thousand years, and you will find an off-seer, carrying out the first Homecoming. Now, in Agnus, no fewer than nine hundred and ninety-nine lives{{footnote: What the sparks... Just so you know, these are fake numbers used to make something look big.}}... have returned themselves to me... It is an auspicious day. I believe such is your view. Yet, for me, it is a day that brings heartache.{{footnote: Shania look grimly, M looked slightly sad.}} I wish... nothing more than the safe return of all life born of me. Such is my eternal hope. To come home is to find comfort."</p>
<p>As the speech continued in the background, Taion, listening to the speech, remarked, "Quite the elaborate production."</p>
<p>Lanz effetely replied, "Fancy. Another <em>puppet</em> on display."</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Assuming Monica's intel was true."</p>
<p>Sena, with her teary tone, "It's all been so pointless... Fighting for that thing."</p>
<p>"She's a phony, that's what she is. Even if it's her in the flesh up there, <strong>I'll rip her off her high horse!</strong>" She slowly loosen the grip on her hands, asked, "You think, uh... <em>They're gonna execute us too after this?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Guess so.</em>"</p>
<p>As she got teary, "So it's... back into the cycle. Back into the same old crap <em>again</em>... <em>Wish we could've gone a little further.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Same here.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "The key's in Ghondor's hands now. I think we've done enough."</p>
<p>Sena tried to convince herself, "Yeah, we've passed the torch. Now, it's up to the City."</p>
<p>The soldiers standing behind them had had enough, sniped at them, "<strong>Shut up! Keep it quiet!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Tch."</p>
<p>The Queen's speech is coming to an end: "...That returns to me. And perpetual raiment{{footnote: The heck, this is how it sounds, not the actual words, nor do we have the subtitles for this.}} warriors."</p>
<p>The Eclipse had not yet reached its perfectness, but it's time to start lest it ends. The soldiers to the side of the throne brought their flutes to their lips, chimed the Homecoming melody with full strength, body swaying with the melody. Noah sighed as he predicted her future.</p>
<p>"Noah giving up? Now of all time?"</p>
<p>Surprised, he peered over his shoulder at Riku, his eyes still bright with hope, yet he rebutted, "<em>I don't want to give up</em>. But we're... trapped here. Our Blades... Tchhhhh... I hope at least... <em>she can... go in peace...</em>"</p>
<p>Riku sighed at such tone he gave. One month of waiting and he hadn't saw him realize himself. Now that it's near the end, he had no more time to wait. He decided to nudge, "<strong>Of course Noah trapped. Noah still not tried to draw Lucky Seven!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Remember? Back when Riku give wisdom? When need of true power, sword will appear."</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah... I remember.</em>"</p>
<p>"Today is day of need. <strong><em>Even at edge, facing sheer drop, must never give up.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Riku..." His attention was immediately disturbed by the sound of heavy doors creaking from his left. The group turned their attention where they saw Mio appeared behind the gap, escorted by 2 soldiers.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mimi...</strong>" Sena knelt higher, followed by Taion.</p>
<p>"Ahuh..." The calmness that he displayed, the desolation that he emanated, all dissipated as they turned into quivering fear of losing her. They watched her taking step after step, passing in front of them.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mio!</strong>"</p>
<p>She did not look at them. As she reached the center aisle, she turned and walked up the stairs leading to the 2nd level. One step after another, no looking back.</p>
<p>"<strong>MIO!!! MIOOOOOOOO!!!</strong>"  He got up on his feet and ran after her. The two soldiers behind immediately pushed forward and thrusted him on to the ground, hard.</p>
<p>Perhaps hearing his shouts, perhaps she reached where she needed to go, she stopped without looking back. The soldiers helped her by pushing down on both her shoulders aggressively, knelt her onto the ground.{{footnote: Well, technically speaking, you can 'knelt someone', just like a broken French saying -- je t'assieds -- I sit you down.}} She looked up at the throne.</p>
<p>Noah brought up his head and saw N legs approaching him.{{footnote: Well, his head is on the ground, and he could only see slightly above his ankle.}} He tried to raise his head a bit to see his face, but the soldiers had him down on the floor. N gave a wave at the soldiers, instructed them to release him, and he broke Noah's chains, releasing his hands. He put them on the ground, crawling forward while trying to get up. N threw the black (Kevesi) flute{{footnote: His old one before exchanging with Mio.}} on the ground before him as it rolled into his vicinity. He looked at it and heard N's stern voice, "Pick it up."</p>
<p>"Huuuuuhhhhhhh...."{{footnote: Quivering breathe.}}</p>
<p>"You're an off-seer. <em>So send her</em>."</p>
<p>His iris diminished into a dot, but he didn't act. N continued nudging, "What's wrong? Go on, send her. Isn't that your role? <strong>Isn't she <em>your</em> Mio?!</strong>"</p>
<p>He climbed up into a knelt position, reached for the flute with quivering hands, grabbed it with both slowly and effetely. He looked deeply at it, and when he looked up, Mio was already emanating yellow motes. "Huhuh...." He had lost all the strength in his hands and body. The flute dropped to the ground and rolled forward. The group watched such cruelty exposed before their eyes. Taion was so heart-hurt at Mio's departure he couldn't open his eyes to watch.</p>
<p>As the moon climbed to a total Eclipse, the sun making a ring around the central dark moon, Noah straightened his body and watched, with diminishing iris, Mio turning around slowly, more and more of her motes rose into the air as peered over her shoulder and her eyes met his. Tears began accumulating at the bottom tip of his eyes{{footnote: Sorry, one don't know what you call the bottom of an eye. Seemingly not in anatomy, or one just don't search correctly?}}</p>
<p>"<strong><em>It's been fun... Noah.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>"</p>
<p>She left him with a smile, the final impression she wanted him to remember was not her cry but her smile; and she was therefore engulfed and turned into motes.</p>
<p>"<strong>MIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>The heartbreaking cry he led out even hit M's heart. She closed her eyes, unable to watch. The queen opened her arms wide, head slightly tilted into the sky, as if to embrace one's return to her.</p>
<p>The remaining motes emanate from the remnants she left behind: a white (Agnian) flute and her shirt. Together{{footnote: the intangibles}} attached to them were her hopes, her dreams, her feelings, her wishes, her conviction, and her legacy.</p>
<p>As the Sun regained its dominance, the darkness shied away. N, full of desolation in his eyes, watched Noah openly shedding tears, both hands and head on the ground. The sideshow hadn't made him happier, nor felt more entertaining. Rewalking the road of hope that leads to despair, again and again, again and again. He had had enough. It's time to end.</p>
<p>Two soldiers walked forward and grabbed both his hands, pulled him up. N walked to the left of him, pulled out his sword, prepared to execute him. He raised his sword over his head, then forcefully slashed downwards. The sound of metal clashing against metal was the last we heard of.</p>
<h3 id="footnotes-37"><a class="header" href="#footnotes-37">Footnotes:</a></h3>

<p>The surrounding were blurry. The day was dark. Noah saw himself laying on the ground. Dead? Perhaps. But who is he? And why is he here, if he had died already? The surrounding, his 'corpse', and everything around him disappeared as fog replaced the scene.</p>
<p>"Well then, you've made your choice. Are you happy with how it turned out? Is this... how you wanted the future to be?" He looked around to find the origin of the voice. In front of him, we saw a hooded figure covering almost all his/her face, only revealing fair-skinned (sharp) chin and neck. The voice seemed comparative to that of a little boy. He was short compared to Noah, below his shoulder.</p>
<p>"Huhhhhh..." As the boy finished his words, he turned around and looked at the emptiness. Fog, fog, and more fog. Then, figures started forming around him, seemingly fragments of different sceneries. The clash of swords against each other. The blowdown of levnises. In all scenes, there seemed to be people standing beside him, distinctive by his sword; and Mio, distinctive by her twin yellow-bladed rings. "Where am I?"</p>
<p>"All this time, you've been repeating the same <em>aimless</em> actions.  All to keep the world this way. And yourself."</p>
<p>"Huhhhhh..."</p>
<p>"Once more today, you've lost the one you cherished most." A screen emerged in front of him, showing Mio's final moment, her smile, her motes, her death. Noah closed his eyes as it pulled a string in his heart, like thrusting a knife into an existing wound. "Are you sad?"</p>
<p>As he turned his attention to the hooded figure, the boy continued, "If you could, would you try again?" His eyebrows raised, but the boy hadn't finished, "Or would you rather... linger in the 'endless now'...?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, Noah, Noah...
Three more months... That's all we need...{{footnote: We skipped the 'Look at this' because it lost the omph, kapow sense.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>All before him disappeared into oblivion.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Noah...? Noah...! Noah!"{{footnote: Damn, this guy's voice sounded like Taion's... Maybe same voice actor? One didn't check, though.}}</p>
<p>He opened his eyes and saw a guy with pointed face, yellow iris, thin eyebrow, and hair covering half his right eyes, wearing something that resembled the Lost Numbers' vest, calling out at him. In the blurry background, a female had her arms crossed, looking at them. Noah was wearing a Lost Numbers' vest too, or just some random dark jacket; same with Mio, whom stood beside both of them, eyeing on Noah.</p>
<p>The guy continued in excitement, "Look at this! We've finally managed to activate the Ouroboros Stone!" The guy turned to his right, where there located the activated Ouroboros Stone, and another guy stood at the other side of the Stone.</p>
<p>Amidst all the excitement and Noah's attentiveness, Mio kept her eyes on him. It doesn't matter what they were doing, where she was going to go, as long as he is by her side, accompanying her. Noah's eyes fixated on the stone.</p>
<p>The guy continued, full of confidence, "Though we don't understand it fully... Some functions may still remain hidden. But still, even in its current state, the power it's releasing is more than enough. With this in hand, <strong>we can fulfill the wish entrusted to us by the Queen!</strong>"{{footnote: Mio's eyes was now on the stone.}}</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "You mean... take back the world from Moebius?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes! Definitely!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Three more months...</em> That's all we need..." He turned to her; she got into her appreciating state, smiling back at him, full of hope, and nodded in return.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fire in the background, Mio effetely rested on his hands, which wrapped around her in his lap. He looked down at her; she looked up at him, her eyes full of sorrow, full of nostalgia.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mio...</strong>" Blue motes started rising from his loved ones, amidst the flames that raged around him. Agnian levnises and soldiers all fallen on the ground. No one else was to be seen alive.</p>
<p>As she finally turned into blue motes without any final words, he, still on the ground, was approached by Z. "So impotent. Did you really think you could... stem the tide? With the paltry power that you possess?" Having just lost his loved ones, he could not even raise his head to look at him so long he spoke. When he finally did, it's all anger and sadness.</p>
<p>"Aarrrrgghhhh..."</p>
<p>"O you, who floats in the currents. You must yield. <strong>Abandon</strong> all you are... " And so Z ended his pitiful life.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah sleeping inside a tent on a bed, woke up from a nightmare by jumping up and gasping. With quivering breathe, he assessed his environment: inside a barrack.</p>
<p>Amidst the dark and gloomy weather, he walked out of the barracks; the dirt below pitch black. Ignoring the other tents set up, a pot of steaming soup caught his attention. He stopped and glanced at it, until Mio's voice pulled his attention, "Morning! You really should've dozed a while longer." She was preparing breakfast, probably, in front of the plates filled with foods.</p>
<p>Perhaps the nightmare had made him inattentive, he mindlessly replied, "Oh... Good morning..."</p>
<p>"Wanna eat? <em>Wait...</em> I forgot you don't like to eat right after waking."</p>
<p>"N-No, I'll have some." He then walked over towards her.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some time later, the day had gotten brighter. The trees were now visible; the tent set up amidst the forest. A lamp on the table where they'd breakfast gave them illumination while the sun worked itself, climbing up the sky. She sat herself to the right table-side{{footnote: That is, assuming one side can only sit one person, she sat '90°' to him.}} of Noah, took a bite of the big brown bread.</p>
<p>"Tomorrow's the day. The final battle against Moebius." He turned his attention to her, as she continued, "We've come a long way to get here. Now it'll finally be over..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." He turned his attention to her term symbol on the side of her neck{{footnote: It never changed position, huh!}}; she instinctively covered it and assured him with a cheering tone, "<strong>It's fine!</strong> I've got three whole days. <em>Three days is plenty. I'm sure we'll be golden.</em>" He didn't speak anything, or maybe, he didn't know how to react to that. Emotionless... Or maybe, a light sorrow.</p>
<hr />
<p>A dark night on the battlefield. Noah was holding his sword (with purple flames) looking at something; Mio sat behind him, blue motes starting to emerge from her body. With a slash, some lives died under Z's eyes. Wherever he walked, their lives (red motes) floated out of their body uncontrollably as they dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>"O you, who floats in the currents. <strong>You must yield.</strong> <em>Did I not tell you?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yield what?" He can't even attend to the dying Mio this time.</p>
<p>"<em>How many times has it been now...?</em>" Both of Z's iris glowed the Moebius symbol, easily disintegrate his sword. He felt the emptiness between his hands, an effeteness engulfed his body and his heart. He dropped to the ground, and blue motes started rising with Z watching. His final moments were spent turning back. She felt so weak she couldn't raise her head to look at him, dissipated before his eyes.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mio... Please no... I can't... I won't...</strong>" He couldn't finish his words before he vanished thereafter her.</p>
<hr />
<p>In the fog, the current Noah concluded,  "<em>The world... I wanted to change it...</em>"</p>
<p>"For whose sake?"</p>
<p>He almost immediately spit out, "<em>I did it for her...</em>"</p>
<p>"But you... <strong>ran away</strong>.{{footnote: This is an emphasis rather than spoke in strong feelings. Just to attract you, my dear reader.}}"</p>
<hr />
<p>Snow covered the ground, blizzard blew strong. Noah, holding on to Mio's hands, they ran and ran and ran despite panting heavily. Their thin clothes could not shield them from the cold. Noah kept running and running; didn't realized that Mio was at her limit. She didn't spoke a word, perhaps because she couldn't, perhaps because, it's all that she need, he accompanying her wherever he goes.</p>
<p>In the background, some muted male voice questioned, "Noah! How can you betray us like this?!"</p>
<p>Another female voice added, "You're just gonna abandon us?! We have the Ouroboros Stone now! What the spark are you thinking?!"</p>
<p>"We trusted you! We followed you for all this time!"</p>
<p>"<strong>NOAH!!! Noah! Where did you go?! NOAH!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>It's too cold to continue. They found a large stone higher than them sitting down, shielding against the blizzard blowing in the opposite direction. They sat themselves, snuggled together, with Mio's body laying on his arm, head rested on his shoulder. He looked at the sky, out of hope.</p>
<p>Turning his attention to her, her breathe was getting slower and slower, weaker and weaker. Her eyes no longer opened, too tired to. He wrapped his arms around her shoulder and pulled her in, trying to give her more warmth. But he himself wasn't any better except for a clearer mind. As his breathe slowed, his vision dimmed, blurred, and finally lost. He dozed off amidst the cold, body forever preserved in deep freeze.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Are you sure it wasn't for yourself?"</p>
<p>He desperately shook his head in denial, "<strong>No! This isn't me!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You only cared... <em>about yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>He dropped his head trying to explain the situation away, "<strong>NO! I was... I didn't...!</strong>" Alas, he could not deny.</p>
<p>"But... with time, <strong>you changed</strong>{{footnote: Again, not strong emotions, just emphasis.}}."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You'll lead the way to a new world, a new way of life.
Our hopes and dreams made into a little person.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>The sounds of baby crying filled the air. The door of a ward opened and in come the elated Noah. His steps light as he moved towards him. All that filled his attention was the baby.</p>
<p>"Strong lungs on that one. Heard him all the way outside." He took a seat beside the bed Mio was laying down on. Her attention was on her child, gently caressing him/her; first time Noah wasn't the first priority to attend to.</p>
<p>"He looks just like Daddy."</p>
<p>"I would've said Mummy."</p>
<p>"Mmm hm hm hm... Our hopes and dreams made into a little person. You'll lead the way to a new world. A new way of life."</p>
<p>"Yeah..."</p>
<p>We could see no one else except the three, not inside, not outside.{{footnote: It may be a mystery how one could give birth oneself without anyone's help, but perhaps the ancient could give us light on how that works? One don't know.}}</p>
<p>"What about... his name? I don't think we ever agreed on one."</p>
<p>"Hahah, it's your call. You're good at naming, aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Uh?" Oh yeah, another person like one whom had difficulty giving names! His eyes flickered from left to right, knowing it himself, "N-no, <em>I don't think that's a good idea</em>... It's probably best... if I don't..." His eyes wavered and looked to his left, only a purple blade attached to his side.</p>
<p>"Ahahahaha! I thought you'd say that... Right, I'll do it. 'Kay?"</p>
<p>"Mhm!" As their eyes looked at him closer, she continued, "Here's what we'll call him, then...{{footnote: The name is up to the imagination of the reader. Whatever you want to call him!}}" Noah gently put his finger on the baby's face, played with him.</p>
<p>Outside the window, the sun was gently on the rise, a new day giving new hope, new dreams, another day to live.</p>
<hr />
<p>The evening sun was about to set in the horizon.</p>
<p>In the same room, Mio laid on the same bed she gave birth to him. Noah sat beside her, with his son in his lap. Their attention did not wavered, looking at her attentively for even her tiniest action. The child was quiet; several years old, he hadn't had the chance to see someone he loved leaving him.</p>
<p>Her fingers gently moved; it caught Noah's eyes. She held it out, trying to reach for her son. He reached out and put hit little hands in hers, gripping it gently. Looking up in curiosity, his mom gave her final wishes in contentment, "I hope... I hope that... the future will be... kinder to you..."</p>
<p>"Mio..." With a smile, in no time she turned into yellow mote, reaching the end of her life. Noah's tears started swelling up, losing his loved ones. His child watched in awe how she disappeared, hadn't yet aware that her mom was gone forever.</p>
<hr />
<p>Amidst the gloomy forest, heavy rain.</p>
<p>Noah took his child on a walk through the heavy grasses. He stopped once the first yellow mote rose from his body. The child looked up and saw his term symbol grayed out completely. He turned, knelt down on one foot to look at him{{footnote: About the same height as his son.}} in his eyes, told him calmly.</p>
<p>"Daddy will have to go soon... All right?" With slightly teary eyes but a strong heart to withhold, he nodded in acknowledgement. "But you know, your Daddy's and Mummy's love, our life, will <strong>always</strong> be within you.{{footnote: He gently put both his arms on his shoulders, assuring him.}} You'll <strong>never</strong>... be alone." He silently looked at him, didn't utter a word.</p>
<p>As the morning sky got brighter, he continued, "<strong><em>Things will get tough... You'll be hurt. You've a whole host of things to go through... as you head into the future. A time might come... when you'll be on the verge of giving up.</em></strong>" Slowly holding his hands up, he strongly looked into his eyes and told him, "<strong><em>But you have to keep going. Make friends. Keep them close to you, always.</em></strong> That's what... <em>Daddy and Mummy did.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mmm... Mhmhm..."  His child agreed reluctantly in a crying tone. Shocked that he teared up, it affected him, and he felt tears in his eyes too. Nothing he could do except leaving him behind himself. He released his arms, grabbed him by his shoulder, and hugged him tight. Tears started dripping down his cheek, as Noah's motes evaporated quick.</p>
<p>Nothing he could do to go back, he pushed him back a little and looked at him in the eyes with strong confidence, the last image he wanted him to see, but his tone was shaky, "We're with you... now and forever..." And he closed his eyes, accepted his fate, and evaporated before his son's eyes, into the dim blue sky.</p>
<hr />
<p>Watching his child seeing him off on the screen, Noah questioned, "Why... Why am I crying? <strong>Why do I look like that?</strong>"</p>
<p>"That's another you. That's how he was."</p>
<p>"Another me?"</p>
<p>He turned to look at Noah, "You from the past."</p>
<p>"<strong>Me from the past???</strong>"</p>
<p>"And then, you made your choice."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are two roads set before every individual...
Have you wished the now would last forever...?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>He opened his eyes. Through his still blurry vision, he saw light from the front; the surrounding was pitch dark. Few blinks later and he saw the projector in the cinematic room projected his past from all reincarnations, particularly focusing in on him and Mio. Z sat at the other side of the aisle.</p>
<p>Z let him immersed in his emotions watching through the different scenes, to put into his memory the memories long lost in rebirth. Then showed a road with two path, a Y-junction, leading to two direction. Grass lined both side of the road, trees blurry in the distance. Both leads to infinity, though the sun seems to rise/set from the right, nearer to the horizon of the path to the right.</p>
<p>"There are two roads set before every individual...{{footnote: Noah turn to see who's speaking.}} The left. The right... What lies down the road you choose? Is it hope? Or despair...? It repeats, and repeats, as you make countless, endless choices. You too, like everyone, have been making them all along."</p>
<p>His eyes moved with his thoughts; and he caught attention of a figuring standing on top of the corridor{{footnote: Remember, there are multiple layers, where you can stand on the corridor to watch the movie if you don't buy a seat down there.}}. It was the hooded figure. Z seemed not to notice him, perhaps because this is just a memory fragment.</p>
<p>"If the results satisfy, that is well and good. But... if <em>they do not satisfy</em>... What then?" The screen turned to share Mio's death, return to the cradle. "Will you weep, battered by grief? Or howl, seething with rage? <strong>Have you never prayed</strong> <em>that time would simply stop</em>? <strong>Have you wished the 'now'</strong> <em>would last forever...</em>? Your two lives, thriving and persisting far beyond Homecoming, surpassing the system of the world. <em>I was fascinated</em>, even beguiled by you. <strong>My name is Z</strong>, the ruler of this world." As he turned his attention to Noah, both his eyes glowing in Moebius, he preached, "I shall grant... your desire."</p>
<p>Noah's eyes widened for a moment, moved randomly, and in no time, he was teleported on stage. He looked up to see the Y-junction road projected in front of him. Z looked below the stage; what would he choose?</p>
<p>"So you have chosen, then." He peered over his shoulder to look at Z, "<strong>The 'endless now'.</strong>" The Flame Clock icon transformed into the Moebius icon; and he was granted the golden armor and an older-looking face, at the price of losing his name 'Noah'; he was thereafter called 'N'.</p>
<p>N took a step forward and walked (literally) into the screen. Z had not made his decision difficult. On the left, it's empty as usual. On the right, Z had resurrected M on the edge of the road awaiting for him. She was looking in the direction of the sun. It was not a difficult choice. He turned right without a second of thought, joined M by her side, as they walked together into the distant sun. Z looked at the path they'd taken, perhaps satisfied, but utterly no emotions shown outward.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah opened his eyes and here, he's back in the foggy environment. Some moment passed as he digest the new information. The boy stood behind him, narrated, "And so, you became Moebius. So that... you could live an eternal now together. <strong>Is this still your wish?</strong> Do you want... to ask one more time, for time to stop?" Showing on the screen before him was N joining M on the path, then changed to Mio's Homecoming from just now, her final smile, turning into motes.</p>
<p>Noah looked down with quivering breathe, fighting internally over choices to make.</p>
<p>"Why is it... that you're here? Why did you split from your other self? Why is it... that you exist?"</p>
<p>Emotionally, "<strong>I thought I</strong>... wanted to know." A sad look in his eyes.</p>
<p>"Know what?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I became an off-seer</strong>... because... <em>I wanted to know the meaning behind the smile</em>."</p>
<p>"Tell me."</p>
<p>"...<em>I had a friend</em>. As important to me as... As Lanz and Eunie, or Joran." His thought controlled the hologram and it displayed Crys playing the melody on their first attended Homecoming.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-noahs-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#start-of-noahs-memories-1">Start of Noah's Memories</a></h4>
<p>Kevesi soldiers and levnises dashing forward on the battlefield. Blasts from Levnises, slashes from soldiers, more and more soldiers fell on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Far away, Crys and Noah stood at a corner, not participating in the fight. On Crys's term symbol, he only had the central circle left red, not long till his Homecoming. He asked, "Noah, will you keep moving?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Me, I'm good here."</p>
<p>"Crys... What do you mean, you're good...?"</p>
<p>Crys turned around and faced Noah. "Thank you." His eyes looked like someone about to pass on a heritage, as if the world would not accompany him for too long, and with a light smile. Suddenly, Noah was shocked by something (which we don't know what happened), moved forward a step, shocked.</p>
<p>After the battle, the sky clear blue in the morning. Black smoke rose from all around the battlefield. The Kevesi had won the battle. Noah, alone, walked on the battleground, found Crys's flute and took it by his hand. He examined the flute attentively, with a loss far more strongly than losing his fellow comrade, gently brought it to his chest, as if to embrace, to mourn for his loss.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-noahs-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-noahs-memories-1">End of Noah's Memories</a></h4>
<p>"Crys... I wondered... why he smiled back then. And not just him... Joran, too." The screen turned to show Joran's final smile before he was smashed into ashes. Noah was clearly feeling slightly desolating; he didn't understand why they could face death with such smile. He closed his eyes, lightly questioned, "<em>I wanted to know why.</em>"</p>
<p>"That's why? Why you continued as an off-seer?" He slightly nodded. The screen shut off so they could concentrate on each other.</p>
<p>"For the longest time... I thought they pitied those of us left behind. <em>'Sucks to be you'. 'Sorry, guys'. 'I'm checking out early'. 'It'll be tough, but keep your chins up'.</em> I figured... that's what the smile said. <em>But now...</em> <em>Mio, too...</em> <strong>was smiling.</strong> I think I get it now... <em>The meaning behind the smile</em>. I think they were all content. <em>With the way it ended</em>. <strong>Like they were putting us in charge</strong>, of the future. <strong>Telling us to make a world where...</strong> everyone, can smile..."</p>
<p>As he looks at his own term symbol, "<strong>But it just breaks my heart, that..</strong> <strong><em>that was the only smile they could choose</em></strong>. And it really shouldn't have been..." Clenching his hands into a fist, "<strong>The world we have now. It doesn't give us the choice to smile.</strong>"</p>
<p>He recalled Cammuravi and Ethel before his death. He recalled Joran showing his Moebius symbol in his iris. He recalled Shania's teary eyes, 'elated' that she joined ranks and gone back under the clock. "If the world won't let us choose <strong>outside these narrow bounds</strong>... I want nothing more... than to rip this world apart." His eyes intensely clear and unwavering of the path we would move this time. "<strong>I want to repay those smiles...</strong>" Then, he turned to the hooded figure, finishing, "That's why I'm here."</p>
<p>She had one last question, one last confirmation, "And you won't choose... the same path as your 'other'?"</p>
<p>"...Who can tell? <strong>I may end up doing that.</strong> But... I'll change it. No matter what... Because... <strong><em>that is the legacy that Mio left me.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Even if you're left alone?"</p>
<p>And he nodded slightly, his tone unwavering, unmoved, clear and strong, "<strong>Even if I'm alone.</strong>"</p>
<p>"In that case..." Two different voice sounded inside the hooded figure, and he removed his hood to reveal his identity: 'it' was her, not him. Mio she was. She handed out her hand to him in an invitation; his eyes wide opened as he saw the person whom he had just lost coming back to life. She smilingly invited, "<strong>Let us walk together.</strong>"</p>
<p>And the fog blinds out as light engulfed the environment before he could react.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="the-sword-of-the-end"><a class="header" href="#the-sword-of-the-end">The Sword of the End</a></h1>
<p>N slashed at Noah; the group shockingly gasped as they expected his head to be cut off. The sword was blocked by a purple glow on the surface of his skin; M launched her shockwave at the last moment, halting his sword from penetrating even a dent on his skin. As the glow dimmed, N, with an unhappy look, turned his attention to M whom betrayed his will.</p>
<p>M walked over to Mio's remnants, picked up the white flute before descending the staircase. The others watched what she had to do, had to say.</p>
<p>"M..." She ignored his words. N backed up two steps to let M take central stage. He signaled to the soldiers holding onto Noah's hands to release him. Sheathing her mask, she bent down to pick up the black flute Noah had dropped on to the ground before him{{footnote: Noah was still bending down on the floor, his heads looking on the ground.}}, looked at both before tucking the black flute into her pocket. She got down in front of Noah, with both hands, handed him the white flute.</p>
<p>"Huh", He finally tilted his head as the flute appeared in front of him. M wouldn't have known he's currently using the Kevesi flute! No, there's no way!</p>
<p>"I'm sorry..." He instantaneously shoot his head up and looked at her, whom continued, "My hair, it's gotten kinda long. Will you still... <em>walk alongside me</em>? Noah?" He remembered the shockwave M released when they first met her, M controlling Mio attacking Noah.</p>
<p>His eyes teary, he tried calling out, "<strong>Mio...</strong>" Is this her? Is this really her? Is this his Mio? A drop of tears slid down his cheek; she smiled and gave him a slight nod, acknowledging its his Mio that had returned.</p>
<p>She had returned; it's really her! Forget about the desperation, forget about the desolation, forget about the anger; it's all nothing if he could have her back! Wiping off his tears, he took the flute from her hands and tucked it into his pocket. Reaching out for her hands, they slowly stood up, eyes on each other all the time, embracing her return, embracing his suffering.</p>
<p>N, on the other side, iris dimmed and dimmed and diminished and diminished into a dot so small we almost cannot see. His fears could not be withheld anymore. This is a situation he couldn't fathom. What had happened? What had happened? It can't be! It can't be!!! His legs getting shakier and shakier, his body effetely stooping backwards, his legs reversed to keep himself standing against gravity.</p>
<p>"Wh-what...! Impossible... <strong>You're</strong>...!"</p>
<p>Mio finally had her attention turned to him; her smile quickly diminished into an angry look, showing what he wanted: an iris with the half-Ouroboros half-Moebius symbol: half yellow, half red; two dragons forming a Tai Chi symbol biting each other's tails; in the middle was a moebius strip symbol, albeit much smaller than the outer TaiChi symbol.</p>
<p>"Ouroboros?! Huhuh!" He recalled when M first launched the first shockwave at the beginning of the battle. Still quivering, he held his hands up and put it on his forehead, "...Does that mean...? <strong>Back then, the two of you...?! So... the one who died is...?</strong>" He turned to look at Mio's, no, M's remnants, shook his head in denial. He had snuffed out her flames; she had gone forever! All that remains was her shirt. "Huh huhuh... <strong>AAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! UHUHUHUH AAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!! WHY, MIO...?!!! WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?! YOU SAID YOU'D BE BY MY SIDE! MIO! ALL I DID, I DID FOR YOU...!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You must have known.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>URRRRGGGHHHH!!</strong>" He glanced at her aggressively.</p>
<p>"<strong>The other me... She couldn't follow you any more... She couldn't go on!</strong>"</p>
<h4 id="what-happened-back-at-first-shockwave"><a class="header" href="#what-happened-back-at-first-shockwave">What Happened Back At First Shockwave</a></h4>
<p>Mio was shown the past memories that she had shared with Noah earlier in an environment similar to Ouroboros space, on a hologram. She watched attentively until M explained, "What you see... Those are our memories." She turned her attention to M, whom continued, "Continuing uninterrupted, since the world was taken captive, a long time ago. Memories of me and him..."</p>
<p>"Why are you showing me this?"</p>
<p>"You are..." She thought for a while, shook her head in denial, "No, all of you are my repentance."</p>
<p>Her eyes widened with curiosity, "Repentance?"</p>
<p>In her appreciating stance, "How I wanted us to be. You embody all our hopes... Our dreams of how this world should be. Even though you and your friends should never have existed, the fact that you are here is proof enough."</p>
<p>"So you'll... let me live? But, if you go through with this, you'll be..."</p>
<p>She squinted her eyes, "<strong>To my Noah</strong>, the time with me is everything." Then she widened it with hope, "I just want it to... <strong>end</strong>." Mio followed by squinting her eyes, shocking to hear.</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"Moebius like me... We can exist only by taking the souls of those... <em>that grace this world.</em>" The hologram now turned to show K and the other Moebius scene they fought before, the screen where they drank lives after either Kevesi or Agnian won, as M continued, "Nobody pays the slightest mind to the thoughts, and dreams those many lives espouse." It now showed the soldiers whom fell to the ground. "<strong>We gorge ourselves, covet every ember, just to delay our inevitable ruin.</strong>"</p>
<p>"That's why you want to disappear?"</p>
<p>"If I die, maybe he'll see... <strong>Maybe he could somehow... realize what it is that I wish. That would be enough.</strong>" They enjoyed a moment of silence as M thought of the moments they shared, and Mio soaked what she had told her, and if that relates to her relationship with her Noah. She continued thereafter, "Afterwards, it'll be up to you two... <strong>to walk the path <em>we</em> ought to have walked... he and I.</strong>"</p>
<h4 id="end-first-shockwave-memory"><a class="header" href="#end-first-shockwave-memory">End First Shockwave Memory</a></h4>
<p>Noah: "The path they... ought to have walked..."</p>
<p>The other Ouroboros were still flabbergasted, until Taion announced, "So it's confirmed... N and M are... other versions of Noah and Mio."</p>
<p>Mio didn't attend to them, still speaking to N: "<strong>The other me... She passed all of her memories on to me. So that I could share... everything with you.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>'Share everything...'</em>"</p>
<p>Noah couldn't fathom: "I have to know. <strong>How could you do this? Why are you on their side?</strong>"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?"</p>
<p>He held out his hands to reminisce on N's son, "<em>I felt him, with these hands... That sensation, the emotion...</em> It was no illusion. <strong>And yet, you still became Moebius! Harvesting people, without even batting an eye!</strong>"</p>
<p>N breathe shuddered as his long forgotten memories was brought into the forefront.</p>
<p>"<strong>I want to know why. Isn't there a trace left inside you? Of your old feelings? Because if there was, even a little-</strong>"</p>
<p>He sniped at Noah before he could finished his sentence, "<strong>Feelings, you say? You dare...</strong> Huhu, huhuhuhuh... My feelings... <strong>My feelings have never changed, THEY'RE THE SAME AS THEY ALWAYS BEEN!!!"</strong>" He pointed his sword at Mio, desperately continued, "<strong>THEY'RE FOR YOU, MIO!!! THE TIME I HAD WITH YOU MEANT EVERYTHING TO ME!</strong> But now... it's all gone... huhuhuhuhuh... <em>If she truly is gone, I'll have to</em> <strong>redo it all! Watch me! Rewind our clocks, back to the start!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huhuh..." Mio felt sad that he can't even understand, drained in his own emotions and needs.</p>
<p>"Noah... <em>My long shadow</em>... You have stolen <strong>her</strong> away from <strong>me</strong>... I will extinguish you, <strong>AND TAKE HER BACK!!! MIO IS MINE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Uhuhuh..."</p>
<p>"She's not yours, she's mine. You are nothing. <strong>SHE BELONGS ONLY TO ME!!!</strong>" He slowly put his sword back into its scabbard, preparing to gather the energy. Taking a step back, his eyes fixed on Noah, and his energy field reverberates the surrounding air{{footnote: 蓄势。}}.</p>
<p>Noah clenched his fist, felt his failure, "Words won't cut it... I can't get through to him... Mio..." She nodded in return. As he turned his look at the other Ouroboros, their shackles were released, immediately turned and faced their guards, gave them kicks and punches and hauled them off the stage.</p>
<p>"Mimi..." She dashed towards Mio...</p>
<p>"Mio!" Taion followed thereafter.</p>
<p>"<strong>Are you... Are you really my Mimi?</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry I worried you. This was the only way." Sena gave her a hug, appreciated their reunion.</p>
<p>"N-no, it's fine... You're here..."</p>
<p>Taion looked in the other direction while they were hugging, shielding them in the background in case someone attacked. As he sensed her attention, he turned and nodded back with a smile, to which she acknowledged. Lanz on the other side just joined, together with Eunie, ran and joined Noah, reminded, "Might wanna leave the teary reunion till later. The mudder's glaring and he looks pissed off."</p>
<p>They stood in a row, Taion commented, "I can more or less grasp what's going on here, but you'd <strong>better</strong> explain the details later."</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah, absolutely. If words won't get through to him, there's only one way left to us. No... <strong>We can't let this go on! Mio!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah! I'm ready when you are!</strong>" Together, both their iris lit their respective symbol and their body overtaken by blue glow as they Interlinked, Noah in control.</p>
<p>X: "They're Interlinking? No way!" She still held out her staff to apocrypha their power, felt shocked when it didn't restricted them. She pointed the staff at them, pushed for more power to shackles them. "No... Can't be! Why isn't Z's power doing its thing?! AHHHH!!!"</p>
<p>Noah's Ouroboros saw X and jumped towards her, with Mio taking control, grabbed the ball at the center of the gyroscope, and squeezed it until it smashed into pieces. "You've gotten ahead of yourself, X."</p>
<p>"Let's get stuck in!" As Lanz sensed his power returned, he was ready to Interlink. Eunie gave a wink at Taion, to which he pinched his glasses and they Interlinked. Mio did a jump and somersault in the air, gave up on X to focus on N. Riku and Manana took their weapons and joined in from behind.</p>
<p>X: "Urgh..." She looked at the Ouroboros, then turned to N whom was still gathering momentum, pitifully asked{{footnote: 撒娇}}, "<strong>N! Come on, destroy them!</strong> Make it so they're not reborn... Pound their souls into the dust!"</p>
<p>"I don't take orders from you. But... <strong>Moebius are the world itself! There can be but ONE ME... AND I AM IT!!!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah's Ouroboros knocked him back. Then, Noah make a grip horizontally directed at his Ouroboros Core, "Huhhhhhurgggggggggg..." He pulled out a sword from within his core; it's center was a replica of the Ouroboros Core.</p>
<p>"The Sword of Origin...! You are going to end it all? <strong>To end Moebius, the pinnacle of life?! This very world?!</strong>" He tucked his sword back and jumped into the air, launched himself at Noah.</p>
<p>Noah blocked his attack with the sword, replied, "If the world holds our lives back, <strong>I will end it! It's as simple as that!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It is impossible! I tried... <strong>We tried to walk that path, and failed!</strong>" He recalled standing at the beginning of the Y-junction road, standing there unmoving.</p>
<p>Noah rebutted, "<strong>You're full of shit! You never tried, you're just a coward!</strong>"</p>
<p>N was shocked how he knocked him back, "What did you...?" Or perhaps, he was shocked by what he labeled him.</p>
<p>"<strong>If you meant it, you'd've found a way! But you didn't even try to make the effort... did you?!</strong>" Noah now prepared to launch an attack at him. "<strong>So what do you know of the world and of life?!</strong>" With one slash, it knocked N's sword into the air, send fire sparks emanated from the point of contact as it sliced through his golden armor.</p>
<p>"AAAAAARGGGGGHHHH!!!" The Sword of Origin disappeared; N dropped to the ground, face slammed against the floor. Noah's Ouroboros landed behind him as he struggled to get up. His sword dropped onto the ground beside him. "URRRGHHHAAAAA!!! URNGH..."</p>
<p>As they turned to him, they cancelled their Interlink. Mio still tried to convince him, "N. Do you know why she traded places with me?" He was breathing furiously, still trying to stand up, as Mio continued, "She felt imprisoned. And you... You put her there." With concerned eyes, she recalled the days and nights M was alone in the cell herself. "Shuffling lives pointlessly back and forth... for an eternity of control."</p>
<p>"You call it... <strong>control?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>She never really wanted anything like that. She just, she wanted to live out her precious days together with you. You should've been able to give her that!</em>" Tears rolled down M's cheek as she stood in front and looked outside the prison window, at the starry night, reminiscing her Noah that had parted ways with her.</p>
<p>"<strong>Is that</strong>... why she handed her life to you?" He gently put his hand at his heart, "<strong>Is that why she rejected me?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>It's not rejection! She understood, she always knew your reasons!</strong> <em>All she wanted was to end your misery...</em> That's the reason she gave this body to me. By leaving this world behind, <em>she wanted to tell you -- she didn't want 'forever'. She wanted to be there with you...!</em>"</p>
<p>By now, N had partially got up, black fog emanating from his core. "And so she left me behind? <strong>SHE WOULDN'T DO THAT!!! HOW COULD WE BE TOGETHER NOW?!!! With her gone from the world, WHAT'S THE POINT OF IT ALL!!!</strong> "</p>
<p>"<strong>It's you that drove her to this! WAKE UP ALREADY!!! You're Noah, right? WHY...? WHY DOES NOTHING SEEM TO GET THROUGH TO YOU?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah noticed the dark particles that was emanating from his X-crest. X noticed too, hypothesized, "...Damage to his Core? Tch... Useless lunk... Although... N is the wielder of the Sword of Origin... It'd be a problem to have him croak here. Don't you think, Z...?" She knew he was watching from the cinema; she knew he knows everything; at least everything that he needed to know.{{footnote: OK, not really everything, or the protagonists won't have a chance to beat him unless with unbeatable powers.}} No reply from Z we can hear of. X continued, "Oh well. In that case..." Both of her iris glowed with Moebius symbol and she took control of the Queen,</p>
<p>"URRRRRRGGGGGHHHHH!!!" The siren-sounding noise alerted Noah and Mio and the other Ouroboros, bringing their attention to her.</p>
<p>Eunie: "LOOK! THE QUEEN!" She was jetted up from her throne into mid-air. That throne transformed into a giant mecha-robot with sharp claws and beam weapons.</p>
<p>Taion: "Is that... Is that what she really was?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Knew it! It's the same as with Keves!"</p>
<p>X: "We've got a winner! In Keves's case, it was all a bit toothless, huh?" The mecha robot floated forward over the top of X and Shania towards the stage below. It aimed its guns and blasted at the Ouroboros and the other Agnian soldiers. The Ouroboros defended, but the Agnian soldiers ran for their dear life. X elatedly announced, "But this time, there will be no escape!" The mecha robot just flew over the top of the stage and chased after the soldiers, claiming their lives. The group quickly dashed forward to engage the Mecha robot, to prevent further unnecessary taking of life.</p>
<hr />
<p>The mecha robot was gathering energy to blast at the group. Before it even finished, Noah interlinked and sliced through its flame clock {{footnote: The one with Keves and Agnus flames from both clockwise and anticlockwise fully charged.}}, halted it, and it released an extremely strong burst of green shockwave that engulfed the whole castle ground, before dropping to the floor and engulfed in flames. The Flame Clock on the main Castle immediately died out.</p>
<p>The Flame Clock inside the Agnian soldiers' iris disappeared and they seemingly lose strength, fell to the ground thereafter. X was terrified, "W-with one blow... <em>That sword</em>... Guess there's no mistaking it. Where did a brat like him get that...?" Riku watched happily as he summoned the sword when he needed the power; Noah and Mio cancelled their Interlink, approached X, with the former announced,</p>
<p>"Don't waste your time on petty tricks. The Castle... is in our hands now."</p>
<p>"Petty tricks, huh...?" She wasn't ready to give up yet. "Hehehe... <strong>You think you've won?</strong>" Both her iris again glowed with the Moebius sign as Noah watched what was to unfold. Suddenly, the ground started shaking vigorously, and a tube stuck out from the pelvis of the floating castle. "Tell me, do you know the phrase 'last laugh'? Admittedly, you probably won't find this very funny... But I will. <strong>See how you like THIS!</strong>"</p>
<p>The tubing split in half, revealing a purple tube with a needle in the middle. Its an Annihilator! Purple sparks began to zoomed through the arrow lines on the side as a purple globule of energy ball gathered in front of the needle. Larger and larger it grows.</p>
<p>Taion quickly dashed towards the stage, shockingly announced what he saw, "<strong>An Annihilator?! There was one in Agnus too!</strong>"</p>
<p>X laughingly announced, "<strong>We have another winner!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie caught up with Taion, concernedly questioned, "<strong>Wait! What are you even gonna shoot?</strong>" The other group dashed past her.</p>
<p>"You wanna know the target? It's right here!" She used her thumb and pointed to her back; the blurry sword laid in the back. All while the Moebius symbol glowed brighter and brighter in her iris. Noah used his Iris to interpolate where she's pointing at and singled out the part of the sword where the City was hidden.</p>
<p>"<strong>The City?!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "How'd they even find it? HUH!!!" She looked up and recalled the person whom was standing beside X all the time, being quiet and out of their attention temporarily. She trod forward, desperately wanted acknowledgement, "<em>You didn't...</em>"</p>
<p>"UHAHAHAHAHAHAAH! AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!"</p>
<p>X: "Ehehehe... I suppose that's that mystery solved."</p>
<p>Sena, her eyes widely opened in disbelievement. Lanz scolded, "You scum... You've even sold out the City?"</p>
<p>"<strong>JUST WHAT THE HELL DO YOU KNOW? You dream of living out your days in peace? You wanna protect the natural way of life? AHAH!!!</strong> All that shite... <strong>is a right afforded only TO THE POWERFUL!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Noah was shocked at what she'd shared.</p>
<p>She continued, "What about those who can't live in peace, huh?! Are they meant to survive in all this chaos, until the very day they die?! <em>I have not one</em> thing to my name. <strong>I don't even have the power to CHOOSE!</strong> Screw it... <strong>For all I care, all of this CAN GO TO HELLLLLL!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena cannot know how she could be so desperate, "<em>Shania, please...!</em>"</p>
<p>X: "Whichever way you lot wanna slice it, your lives are in our grasp! I will teach you the meaning of <strong>regret</strong>, and reap you like so much <strong>rotten grain</strong>!" The Annihilator finally reached its maximum gatherment; purple rings encircled the edge of the tubing as it launched and colored the sky purple.</p>
<p>They group shielded their eyes as they watched the fate of the City. X looked up at the sky and shouted, "<strong>Z!!!</strong>" Then, she was teleported off the location. N, still bending on the floor, perhaps was forced teleported back to where Z was.</p>
<p>The Annihilator died down after the launch. Shania, with the tip of her mouth pushing up to smile, turned around and saw the Annihilator blew a hole in the location of the City. Rocks encircled the center of the impact.</p>
<p>Sena watched in awe, prayed, "Please, no! The City..." Even Lanz's eyes showed clear desolation as they watched their hope wiped out.</p>
<p>Noah took the blame after a few moments, "Huuhhh... It's all my fault... I didn't think they'd have an ace up their sleeve... I got careless..."</p>
<p>Mio reassured, "It's OK."</p>
<p>Noah turned to her, wasn't sure why she was calm, "What...?" She gave him a confirmatory node and turned to face the sky the same direction. Shania was shocked by their reaction, turned around as heard ships rising up to the level of the Castle ground. It was a Levnis no different from the one Guernica crashed.</p>
<p>Manana: "Levnises from City incoming!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Who the-?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>AHOYYYY!! Ya dags!!!</strong>" More and more levnises floated upwards as she shouted through a speaker.</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>That voice... Ghondor?!</strong>" Shania terrifyingly watched as she appeared  and cursed,</p>
<p>"Guess who's back, bitches!"</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship parked around the empty spaces in Agnus Castle ground. Ghondor, accompanied by Oggy and Aggy, approached the Ouroboros with Shania watching in the background, still frozen. Behind her lined some Lost Numbers' holding their guns.</p>
<p>Noah excitedly exclaimed, "<strong>Ghondor! You're all right?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Damn, that was gonna be my line! Heh..." She turned to Mio, "Looks like things worked out over here anyway."</p>
<p>Noah just joined the dots, "Did she...?"</p>
<p>"Yep." That day, Ghondor and Monica watched Mio teleported into the City. "If she hadn't clued us in, we'd be up shit creek now."</p>
<p>"Right... Mio..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Monica and the others?"</p>
<p>She effetely replied, "Bitchqueen's fine, too..." Then, touching her temple to send data to their Iris, "The City's currently right about... here."</p>
<p>On his Iris, Noah exclaimed at what he saw, "<strong>Underneath the world?! How is that possible?</strong>"{{footnote: Unfortunately, one could see nothing from the turquoise screen other than the City surrounded by rocks with no special features that stood out.}}</p>
<p>"The City itself is actually a massive bloody Ferronis! If we feel like it, we can move it to anywhere in the world."</p>
<p>Even Taion was impressed, "<strong>Simply astounding!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "I thought it was just like an oversized Colony."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "That wasn't exactly common knowledge. The Bitchqueen and I knew... <strong>and a handful of others</strong>, that's it. <strong>We had to be sure</strong>... so that some slimy traitor wouldn't drop us in it."</p>
<p>"<em>Traitor...</em>" Sena whispered, turned her head around as they faced the lonely Shania. She was still panting furiously, couldn't accept her fate. When everyone turned to look at her, her iris diminished into a dot, as if with fear, or perhaps, with anger, with anti-resignation.</p>
<p>Ghondor slowly paced towards her, arms around her hips, "All right... I'm not gonna ask 'why'. I suppose I know the reason. But if it's what I'm thinkin', then I don't get it at all. <strong>If we'd made one mistake, the City woulda been wiped out.</strong> <em>Before we're done, you'll tell me everything I wanna know, Shania</em>." The reverberating in her tone revealed that she did care for her childhood friend.</p>
<p>The group watched and waited for her reaction and reply. She took several steps back, as if gravity pulled her backwards not downwards. Her hands clenched heavily and shakily at her failure. Desperately, she spoke, "<strong>It's your eyes, that look! You've <em>always</em> looked at me that way! WHY DID IT HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS...?! WHY IS IT ALWAYS ME, STANDING HERE ON MY OWN???</strong>"</p>
<p>"Shania..."</p>
<p>"Uhuhuhuhuh... I've had it... Huh... <strong>I've had it UP TO HERE!</strong>" She withdrew her blade, a pistol, and pointed it at Ghondor.</p>
<p>"Hoh!" Ghondor was shocked at her hostility. Oggy and Aggy quickly step forward and called their blades; some others backed up, other Lost Numbers stood forward; Eunie and Taion hyper-reactively summoned their blades.{{footnote: Others like Sena, Lanz, Mio, and Noah didn't call their blades.}}</p>
<p>She took a few steps back, pulled the pistol to her right ear, and pointed it on her temple.</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>SHANIA!</strong>"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "<strong>DROP IT!!! THIS ISN'T WHAT I MEANT BY 'DONE'!!!</strong>" She quickly dashed past Aggy and Oggy, trying to reach for her.</p>
<p>She cut her off, "<strong>Don't misunderstand...</strong>" Ghondor stopped on her track as Shania continued, tears rolling down her eyes, as she shouted, "This is... <strong>THIS IS THE BEGINNING!!!</strong>" And she shot herself on her temple. The sky rotated around her; and before she dropped to the ground, she saw Ghondor and Sena dashed after her.</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>SHANIA!!!</strong>" Ghondor's hands reached out for her as she approached; but it was too late; her head hit the ground and she was done for.</p>
<p>The group (Ouroboros and Ghondor's) gathered around Shania, felt sad despite her misdoings. Sena knelt beside her corpse.</p>
<p>Noah walked forward, knelt down behind her, and put a hand on her shoulder, lightly asked, "<em>Are you... ready, Sena?</em>"</p>
<p>She turned to him, "<em>Noah...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>This is the fate that Shania chose. It isn't the end.</em>" As they turned their attention back to her, he continued, "Like she said herself, this is the beginning. Come on. Up you get." Her feelings when she said they were the same never fades; her desire to find someone whom can reciprocate with her, and to lose her, can't be easily get over with, or maybe, not even forever.</p>
<p>Mio reached out and gently placed her fingers on her other shoulder, assured her it would be OK. She looked up at her eyes, Mio nodded back to her. With Mio's help, she got up, still looking at her corpse.</p>
<p>Noah: "I don't know if it'll reach her... But still... Sena, we'll do <strong>all</strong> we can."</p>
<p>"Mhm..." The blue morning sky in the distance signified a new beginning.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Lost Numbers were curing the injured Agnians. One Agnian, perhaps a leader, leaded Aggy and Oggy to someplace. The Agnian soldiers started chatting with the Lost Numbers without displaying hostility. Some looked to repair their Levnises.</p>

<p><strong>Note from Translator</strong>: This is a digression from the main story. Feel free to skip it to the next if you would like it be more 'smooth' a story. Feeling the heaviness of losing Shania, one thought, perhaps you'd want to know her ends.</p>

<p>Sitting around a table{{footnote: Any table for discussion at any location would do.}}, Ghondor complaint, "Tch. Pain in the arse."</p>
<p>Noah: "Sorry? Something wrong?"</p>
<p>"...Eh, I guess I could tell you lot. There's been negotiations about who from the Lost Numbers should be left stationed at the Castle."</p>
<p>Mio: "Negotiations with the City?"</p>
<p>"Yep. So they've said it should be someone who can stay on good terms with Agnus. If there was anyone like that, we wouldn't be in this whole damn mess in the first place!"</p>
<p>Sena: "You sound really worked up..."</p>
<p>"And here's the kicker -- we've gotta keep it to one unit. Can you believe it?! The Bitchqueen strikes again..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Well, let's just slow down for a moment."</p>
<p>"Hey, I know. Why don't you help us out? You've got nothing better to do, right?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I would like you to rethink what you just said." As if <em>we</em> are couch potatoes sitting around!</p>
<p>Just then, Noah's iris was ringing, "Hm? Monica's calling us."</p>
<p>"Ugh, speak of the Bitchqueen... You... You don't reckon she was listening, do ya...?"</p>
<p>Noah didn't answer her, instead accepted the (group) call, "Monica? What's up?"</p>
<p>"Hey, sorry to bother you. Something's come up, and we'd need your help rather urgently. We wanted to retrieve the contents of the material storage warehouse, but there's been a difficulty..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Huh, material storage warehouse...? The one that the conservatives held...?"</p>
<p>"Well deduced. The very same. According to Garrett, he'd not had the time to fetch it ever since the City shifted location... But I can't bear just leaving it all there... There's a lot of good stuff, after all. I wanted to send an Armory down that way, but there's a bunch of monsters around. I was hoping you could take out some of the ones in that area."</p>
<p>Noah: "Understood."</p>
<p>"Thanks in advance."</p>
<p>After they hung the call, Ghondor continued her complaints, "She sure is good at dishing out orders. Come on then, let's get it over with."</p>
<p>Lanz: "You coming with us, Ghondor? We'll be fine by ourselves."</p>
<p>"I need something to take my anger out on. You're gonna have to put up with me."</p>
<p>Eunie teased, "...Just keep track of what you're punching, eh?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside the material warehouse.</p>
<p>After they killed the flying monsters, Ghondor announced, "Yep, job's a good 'un!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Seems a bit slapdash if you ask me..." He turned around to analyze the surrounding empty, barren environment. "But it'll do. Enough to keep it secure, at least. Noah, you can tell the City."</p>
<p>"Will do." While Noah called the City, the others turned their attention to the warehouse.</p>
<hr />
<p>A central hole at the very top allows anyone inside the cavern a clear view of the sky. Water dripped from the rocks bordering the hole and the walls onto the shallow turquoise-clear water below. On the surface floated Shania, slowly drifting with the stagnant flow, unconscious.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-her-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-her-memories">Start of Her Memories</a></h4>
<p>With great smile on her face, she ran home, was eager on sharing the news. "<strong>Mummy! I did it! I'm a candidate!</strong>"</p>
<p>She kept her heads down on the sewing of patterns on a piece of cloth, ignorant of her emotions, coldly asked, "What rank?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Rank?"</p>
<p>"What place were you? They must have said." She had a glowing green iris; her face represent the depression amongst the depression, strictest of the strictest, where you'd expected no smile from her whatever emotions and atmosphere the surrounding emanates. She put the sewing down.</p>
<p>Being forced guilty by her mom, she quietly answered, "<em>I... I ranked eighth place...</em>"</p>
<p>"A reserve, then."</p>
<p>"Bbbb--but! In the third test, there were a hundred people!"</p>
<p>A hundred people? That's none of her concern. She only focus on one number: "<strong>'Only six of us can become Ouroboros.'</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ugh..."</p>
<p>"If you aren't one of those six, you may as well be dead last. We are one of the Six Houses. <strong>The Reid family honor is at stake!</strong>"</p>
<p>All her happiness evaporated into mist; she started crying.</p>
<p>And like many stereotypical Asian parents (and probably non-Asian too) that like to do one thing to their children: to apply pressure that forces them to the edge of committing suicide, "And Vandham?"{{footnote: For God's sake, just do better than yourself, why the comparison to other people when they're none of your business?}}</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>The Vandham girl. Ghondor.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ghondor was... first place."</p>
<p>"Urgh! <strong>Those bloody upstarts, at it again... How could we lose to those nobodies?</strong>" She turned to look at her husband, now living only inside a frame, "<strong>Every generation up until your father, bless his soul, made the main team...</strong>" A.K.A. You're such a shame!</p>
<p>Her tears started aggregating deeper and deeper, stronger and stronger, heavier and heavier. Turning to a young woman with short hair beside his dad's photo frame, Shania's mom continued living in her memories, "If only dear Titania were still alive..."{{footnote: Yeah, another thing parents do: they said you're worse than any other siblings you have, whether from your family or your cousins. As if you're a God that performs first place in every aspect of life?}}</p>
<p>Shania gasped at what she said...</p>
<p>"<em>Some legacy this is.</em>" Yeah, she was the nobody. Only Titania and her dad lived in her heart, in her mind; she was the nobody, the one that could never please her mom. As she glanced through their photos, she clenched her fist, telling herself that she will one day, one day, become like her dad, become like Titania! She'll be her mom's girl!</p>
<hr />
<p>By her own in her room, Shania could finally cry out to herself. She looked at a painted drawing: her dad holding to a sword with Guernica Vandham crossing his muscular arms, looking at him. Beside laid a brush.</p>
<p>With defying anger, she banged hard at the table, teared the drawing to scrapes, and broke the brush into shards. She successfully turned her desolation into defiance anger.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-her-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-her-memories">End of Her Memories</a></h4>
<p>Waters continued dripping down the line and Shania opened her eyes, revealing the Moebius symbol in one of her iris.</p>
<p>X immediately called, "Congrats, lamb! As of today, you're officially a fully-fledged Moebius comrade."</p>
<p>"I became... Moebius?"</p>
<p>She elatedly replied, "<strong>You can play to your heart's content!</strong> The fun starts here. Eh? You get a fresh start. Forget about your old self."</p>
<p>Shania slowly sit up from the water and stood beside her. She wasn't looking very happy even though the news reached her. "So I get to do... whatever I want?"</p>
<p>X perhaps saw her memories, saw her desires, "You wanna be 'someone', right? Not some kinda phony. <strong>The real deal.</strong>"</p>
<p>The secrets that buried deep in her hearts revealed; her breath quivering and shaky! How did she knew that! She recalled what Ghondor shouted at her,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Don't you have</strong> any originality?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She looked at herself on the reflecting water surface. As if with the power of her heart, her old self faded into the distance, and she <em>is</em> now Ghondor. The real her (not the reflection) didn't transform, though. With shivering breathe, she found it hard to step forward.</p>
<p>X nudged, "<em>You can be. You've just gotta destroy the faker. See?</em>"</p>
<p>"The faker..."</p>
<p>"<em>C'mon now... Be true to yourself...</em>"</p>
<p>She was nudged, "I know who it is... <strong>The faker...!</strong>" Ghondor's image disappeared from the reflection and her new self, in her Moebius suit, replaced it. She had been granted her Moebius suit, with its core glowing bright purple. As she looked up in the sky, her iris glowed moebius, she found what she wanted, her future's goal -- revenge it is.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside of the warehouse, the Ouroboros had moved the items outside, piling them amidst the blizzard sky. They were chatting in sub-groups as they waited for the Lost Numbers to arrive. Hearing the sound of the approaching ship, Sena announced, "Guess that's our ride." They looked up and saw one ship approaching.</p>
<p>Ghondor wasn't satisfied at their speed, complaint, "They're late as hell. Coulda got here in half the time. Let's go meet 'em." The group followed her to the ship's parking location.</p>
<hr />
<p>A door that leads to unknown location; there were some rusty-colored building structures with green fluorescent lamp attached to the walls. Shania teleported into that location. As she walked to the fenced ledge, she looked down and saw the City. From the tallest point of view, she could see a zoomed-out view of the activities below. Her minds, dwindled in the remnants of her old memories,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Would you quit copying me?! You're not even good with those things!</strong>"  She knocked the punching gloves off her hands. Still crying, Ghondor continued, "Too heavy for ya? Your sister's gun?"{{footnote: So Titania is her sister.}}</p>
<p>With trembling hands, she summoned her blade, a short pistol that doesn't look like it had very strong strengths compared to muscles. Ghondor looked at her raising it slowly, still trembling, gave her another advice less aggressively,</p>
<p>"You don't need that. Ditch it." Before she turned and walked away, she continued, "<em>That's not where your talents lie.</em>" She always know, she always know.{{footnote: She wasn't born to fight, but born to draw!}}</p>
<p>Self-absorbed and unable to accept her advice, "I tried ditching it. (gasp) I would have it if I could, long ago..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Ghondor..."</p>
<hr />
<p>There were still a few supply boxes to be onboarded. While working, Ghondor received a call and sounded serious after listening, "<strong>And you verified that?</strong>"</p>
<p>Hearing her heightened tone, the Lost Numbers and Noah turned and asked, "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>The group eavesdropped on the consecutive conversations, "<strong>Moebius</strong>?! But how would they know where... <em>Wha-</em>?!" After she ended the call, she was silenced for a moment.</p>
<p>Noah prompted, "What's happened?"</p>
<p>She didn't reply, stuck in her thought and gritted her teeth, "Urggggh!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ghondor!</strong>"</p>
<p>Turning to him, "It's Moebius... <strong>They attacked the City.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huuuurgghhh!!!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Moebius did?!!! For real?</strong>"</p>
<p>"The perpetrator..." <em>Perpetrator</em> the word reminded Sena of someone as she gasped, and Ghondor continued, "<strong>was Shania.</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Amidst the war-torn city, flames burning everywhere, Shania stood in the middle of flaming rubble, just like N did ages ago. She felt not the slightest happiness even after revenging.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Taion: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "How's that possible?! I mean, we saw her die...!"</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't surprised, reminded them, "Well, it happened before with Joran... <strong>Spark it.</strong> So she's joined their ranks."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Shania...</em>" The more she thought about her, the more regretful she felt.</p>
<p>Mio saw her anomaly, called for her attention, "Sena..." That didn't break her out of her self-deprecating loop, unfortunately.</p>
<p>"<em>I knew it. I saw this coming.</em>{{footnote: Of course, hindsight bias is at play here.}} And still, I couldn't..."</p>
<p>Mio reciprocated her feelings, "Sena... You want to see this through, don't you?"</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, Mimi...</em>"</p>
<p>"We've got your back, OK? Come on. Let's go."</p>
<p>Seeing her encouragement, she nodded, "Mm... <strong>I have to do this. I swear,</strong> I'll settle this. On my life, <strong>it will be done.</strong>"{{footnote: Shania died too fast last time; now that she'd the chance to reverse her regret, she'll try her best to.}}</p>
<p>As Ghondor finished listening to their conversations, she turned her attention to the Lost Numbers and shouted commands, "<strong>Forget the cargo. Get us to the City!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ma'am!</strong>" Then, they dashed off to get the ship started.</p>
<p>With unwavering voice, she called out, "<strong>Ghondor! Take us with you!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Sena? You sure?</em>"</p>
<p>"She's Moebius, right? Then <strong>we've gotta go with you!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>This is Shania.</strong> You up to it?"</p>
<p>Eunie explained, "<em>A friend of ours became Moebius too.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz continued, "<em>But still, we came to terms with that.</em>"</p>
<p>"Never knew... <strong>Real tough cookies, aintcha?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Speak for yourself, <em>Ms. Hard-as-nails.</em>"</p>
<p>She closed her eyes and thought for a while, voiced out, "You can still back out. <em>Last chance</em>."</p>
<p>With unwavering voice, to not be regret forever, Sena firmly stated, "No. It's fine. I'll do this."</p>
<p>Seeing her unmoved, she gave in, "<em>All right then</em>. <strong>Move it! Get yer arses on board and let's hustle!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship helicoptered into mid-air, retrieved its stands, before zooming into the distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Fighting manned levnises/ships parked at the square, firing guns at the invading Moebius. City folks gathered themselves inside the Founder's hall. More and more of the Levnises exploded as they held their last stand. Amidst the fallen burning levnises, Shania walked through the flames, unscathed, towards Monica and the other soldiers.</p>
<p>"Shania, eh?" Monica summoned her blades, a shield and a flat throng, clashed them together, as if saying, 'come, come'! The Moebius symbol in Shania's iris glowed.</p>
<hr />
<p>While the ship zoomed through Erythia Sea, Sena chatted to Ghondor, whom sat next to her, "<em>I didn't know. She had a rough time of it.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>That kid...</em> She was always trying to please her mum. No... Trying to live up to her mum's expectations. <strong>Thing is...</strong> sometimes life deals ya a shitty hand. <em>We were all desperate.</em> Shoulda seen the crap I went through." As if realizing something, she turned to Sena, explained, "<strong>This ain't a sympathy vote, though.</strong>"</p>
<p>"You're so strong. More than me."</p>
<p>"<em>That doesn't even factor.</em> <strong><em>It's your attitude that matters.</em></strong>" Now that's something to idolize.</p>
<p>"Hate to break it to you but... that's... being strong."</p>
<p>She wasn't willing to immersed herself in her praise, "I was born with a gift, and I'm using it, is all."</p>
<p>"And... if you hadn't been born with it?"</p>
<p>"You see the problem now?"</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship arrived at the City, which situated itself below some rocks inside a huge cavern. We could see water falling in the distance.</p>
<p>Ghondor was communicating with the driver over her iris, "Anything?"{{footnote: Either too lazy to open the door to the front, or it was dislocated, like if you're in a container and they're in the lorry, it's not connected from the inside.}}</p>
<p>"Sorry, ma'am. Nothing for the past half hour."</p>
<p>"Tch. <em>So we were overwhelmed</em>."</p>
<p>One of the Lost Numbers sitting with the group questioned, "Don't you think it's strange, though?"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"We've already covered so much ground, but it's been dead silent."</p>
<p>Taion acknowledged, "<em>That's a point.</em> If they've already overthrown the City, <em>why haven't we met any resistance</em>?"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "No..." She knows more than they do about her childhood friend.</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"This is what she wants. She's biding her time, waiting. Ready to give us a piece of her mind, I'll bet." Sena got what she meant; her desire to share what she felt, and hoped for reciprocation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship arrived at a door; the door opened and the ship entered the City. Looking around, the City folks were still alive, but they were frozen -- red smoke sizzled from their body that forced their body and mind to froze in time, as if time had stopped. Her mom clung to one of the memorial statue, frozen as she watched Shania stopping some distance away from her. Shania looked at her attentively at the person that never praised her when she wanted it. Even frozen, she could not fathom why she hadn't welcomed her child home, whatever she'd became; instead, only showed fear, to fear her own child. Shania opened her mouth as if wanted to speak something, but gave up. She teleported away instead. Even amidst the flames, her mom never forgot the glory of the Reid family, to clung onto the Reid family statue.{{footnote: As per appendix, it's Shulk, the founder's mentor.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship parked itself at its usual parking location, the 'helipad'. Exiting the ship, the group scanned their environment for clues. Descending the stairs, they saw the frozen folks and few dispersed motes slowly dissipating from their body. The Ouroboros Candidates still held out their weapons in their frozen position. Others just stood still.</p>
<p>Sena tried to fathom what was going on, "What's with... No one's moving."</p>
<p>Noah asked the only person whom knew more about moebius, "Mio, is this...?"</p>
<p>"Mm. It has to be. Though I've never seen this power before."</p>
<p>Drawing out Lucky Seven, he questioned, "You think it's... Shania?" He pointed the sword at different directions, trying to sense for Moebius power concentration.{{footnote: The Sword of Origin had the ability to reverberate faster when it point towards a source of stronger Moebius power.}}</p>
<p>"You know where to go?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer her, turning around to search for the strongest reverberation. After he found it, he replied, "Over there." It leads them towards the memorial hall.</p>
<hr />
<p>Eunie put her hands on one of the body of the female Ouroboros candidate, "Still warm..." Turning to the others, she shouted, "<strong>Hey, guys! They're still alive!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Are you certain?"{{footnote: So much for viewing a situation from a different perspective; so much for our default thoughts that prevented us from thinking otherwise, from questioning our assumptions.}} He tried feeling the boy in front of him.</p>
<p>Lanz was with another 'grandmother', "Looks like she's right."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Their vitals seem to be fine."</p>
<p>Sena: "I can see them breathing, very faintly."</p>
<p>Noah and Ghondor turned to each other, with him hypothesizing, "Perhaps there's still time. <strong>Hurry!</strong>" They dashed off into the distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>As they group approached the square outside the memorial hall, they could hear firing shots and see those parked Levnises still shielding the location. "It's right down this way. Hurry!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>Mother!</strong>" First time she didn't call her Bitchqueen, eh! Alas, Monica and the other Lost Numbers were already frozen by Shania's Moebius special move. "You got to her too! <em>Shania.</em>"</p>
<p>She was, as she thought, eavesdropping. "<strong>What do you think, Ghondor?</strong>" They turned and saw her teleported into the scene. "<strong>Isn't it a work of art?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huuuhhh... <strong>Shania.</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Did you do this?"</p>
<p>"Ha..."</p>
<p>"<strong>TELL ME!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>In an elated tone that Joran had displayed before, "<em>Being Moebius... It's just incredible.</em>"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "'Scuse me?"</p>
<p>"<em>I have control</em>. <strong>Just look! I can freeze everything in its place!</strong> <em>Humans, and objects</em>... <strong>Exactly like a painting on a canvas!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "That's it? That's why you made everyone stop?"</p>
<p>"Ahah! I even have the power... to stop the very flow of air itself." After the group gasped at that possibility, she elatedly questioned, "What do you think might happen if I do that?"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "You dare..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ahahahah!</strong> It's a real sight to behold, eh, Ghondor? I could almost paint it right now."</p>
<p>"<strong>What the hell are you doing this for? What are you after?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You're asking that now? <em>You know why, Ghondor.</em> <strong>I wanna tear it all down! The City, and you lot too! And then I'll repaint it all, in my own hue.</strong> <em>A nice red will do.</em>{{footnote: Oh, how it rhymes!}} <strong>A VIVID, BLOOD RED!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Shania...</em>"</p>
<p>"That's right, you just keep on glaring. <strong>Enjoy cursing your own helplessness!</strong>" As she activated her Moebius Iris, she launched her special move like Mio's shockwave, caressed through the group's body and froze them in place. They could still speak, though, unlike the other City Folks that'd been frozen for too long.</p>
<p>Taion: "Gah! C-can't move! Ugh!"</p>
<p>As the group was struggling, Mio called out, "Noah!"</p>
<p>Strained, he replied, "Yeah." His hands slowly reached for Lucky Seven, struggling against her freezing power. As it reached the handle, he pulled the sword, which sent a strong shockwave that broke the curse (like N's shockwave), stopping her power in its track, releasing them from deep freeze. "You can't beat us. We've been through far worse than this. You've got to set these people free! <strong>Shania!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Just like what you did at the Castle, huh...  Ohh, you Ouroboros really are infuriating little weevils!"</p>
<p>Ghondor rebutted, "And yet, you spent how long trying to be one? What happened to your dream?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Like hell!</strong> I said I want it gone! <strong>It all belongs in the garbage! Your lives! THIS WORLD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena spoke to her heart, to the truth she'd been rejecting so far, "If you hate it so much..."</p>
<p>She gasped as Sena continued, felt something she doesn't want to hear is coming.</p>
<p>"If you really hate this world... <strong>Why aren't you trying to tear it down yourself? Change it with your own hands!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>I told you, I'll wreck every last thing-</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>You can do it differently! There's still a way you can change!</em> And that way, the world will fall away by itself. <strong>It'll all change!</strong>"</p>
<p>The possibility already lingered in her mind, but she can't think about it, she can't face it, she can't fathom it. She had already gone too far. Instead, she rejected and criticized, "<strong>You got it easy, Sena. Bet life's been cushy for you. Get off your high horse!</strong>"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "<strong>You've got it all wrong! All I'm trying to say is-</strong>"</p>
<p>She doesn't want to listen to more, lest she get convinced, "<strong>I'M NOT THE SAME AS YOU!!! WE'RE NOTHING ALIKE!!!</strong>" Yep, she's now a Moebius, and her Ouroboros.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "And that's why you became Moebius? 'Fraid it was a waste of effort. You're still <strong>nowhere near</strong> our equal."</p>
<p>"<strong>WHAT?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Couldn't live up to House Vandham, could ya?</strong> Yeah, we were gifted. House Reid couldn't hold a candle to us!"</p>
<p>"<strong>SO, YOU ADMIT IT THEN!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>She get into a boxing move and continued, "<strong>If that's what you wanna think, then bring it!</strong> I'll show you what's different, once you get a taste of my fists! <strong>Or are you gonna wimp out? Lose this one, AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANYWHERE LEFT TO CALL HOME!!!</strong>" Words can't get to her, punching should do.</p>
<p>Sena was shocked, "<em>Ghondor!</em>"</p>
<p>Shania couldn't take it anymore, transformed into her moebius form. "<strong>UUURGGGGGHHHH ARRRRRRRRGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!</strong>" It had short flimsy legs, slightly larger arms; but what's most distinguishing is the four claws on her twin braid of her enlarged pony tail braided hair.</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Hurrrrghhhh..." She lost to the Ouroboros, forced transformed back to her human form, hands and feets on the ground, panting heavily. Ghondor and the others wasn't less exhausted than her.</p>
<p>"<strong>I can't lose this.</strong>" She struggled to stand on her feet, "<strong>If I screw this one up, THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ME LEFT IN THIS WORLD!!!</strong>" Energy emanates out from her core; she can't transform now, but she's gonna continued fighting in her human form.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "<strong>How do you still not get the message?!</strong>" The others didn't joined in the fight between the two rivals. Ghondor, sacrificing her blades, punched hard into her core and shattered it before Shania could land her hit on her. The moebius power escaped her core and she dropped effetely forward thereafter. Ghondor sheathed her blade and held her down, hugging her.</p>
<p>"<em>Wha... How...? How did... I...? I'm Moebius. Ghondor... I did it... I really became... Moebius.</em>"</p>
<p>With tears in her eyes, "<em>Thought I told you... Your calling, it isn't this stuff.</em>" She recalled and reminded her,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shania was painting happily on a canvas, the canvas that she tore later about her dad and Guernica, at the square when Ghondor approached her, with a surprised voiced, smiling at her, "<strong>Ohhh! Didn't know you could paint like that.</strong>"</p>
<p>Shania looked up in awed that someone had noticed what she'd been trying to hide for long, trying to reject it, "Ah, no! This isn't-"</p>
<p>"C'mon, show me some more!" She took her canvas away to look at it attentively. "<em>Ooooohhh</em>! <strong>Hey, this is your dad, right?</strong> Heh, and this one's my stinky old man, eh? It looks just like him. You're bloody good!" All the while Shania was feeling embarrassed that she noticed. "But why them?"</p>
<p>"'Cause... <strong>I wanna be like them, someday.</strong>" She looked aside, not very confident in her hope. "Protecting the City... Everyone looking up to me..."</p>
<p>"That your dream?" She nodded, and Ghondor continued, "Not sure you need to be worrying about something like that."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"They're just a bunch of old fogies. Just be true to yourself." Then, she held up the art she painted in front of her, "Bet none of those farts could make art like this. <strong>This should be your calling!</strong>" There was a thin smile on Shania's lips.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The group sheathed their blades, seeing that the violence was over.</p>
<p>Lanz whom heard their story, "Same as... with Joran." The knitting and carving of the wooden puppets, eh! The atmosphere was heavy as she was dying. As blue motes started rising from her body,</p>
<p>"You're saying that now? No one... not even once... has ever expected that from me..."</p>
<p>"You sure about that? <em>'Cause I know someone. You were wanted.</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shootings at a target; not a miss, but ranged at the outer rings. Shania can't make perfect shots.</p>
<p>"Is that Titania's gun, Shania?" A male with old voice approached and asked.</p>
<p>"Yeah." She replied without even turning her head to look at him, continued practicing, continued shooting. "She's not around any more. I have to do what I can."</p>
<p>"<em>Shania... Put it down</em>."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Seriously, he repeated, "Put... the gun... down."</p>
<p>"O-OK." She couldn't reject her dad's request, but felt sad perhaps of disapproval? She obeyed anyways and put it on the chest beside softly.</p>
<p>As he walked towards her, he asked, "Wouldn't you... prefer something a little more like this?" He took her hand from behind and handed her a painting brush.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened, "Huh? But..."</p>
<p>"Daddy just... wants to see his daughter enjoying doing the things she loves the most."</p>
<p>"Papa..." A thin smile on her face.</p>
<p>He urged, "Go on."</p>
<p>Smilingly, she took the brush from his hands and treated it with care.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>She had finally recalled the long forgotten memories, closed her eyes as tears aggregated at the tip of her eyes. Softly, she spoke, "<em>Hey...</em>"</p>
<p>"Mm?"</p>
<p>"<em>You... you hate it, right? Your name. Why... Why not ditch it?</em>"</p>
<p>"Like that's an option. Much as I whine about it, it makes me feel connected, wherever I am. It's special. Because it's the name she gave me." Shania's eyes widened as she heard her approval of Monica even though she always called her Bitchqueen. "<em>Kinda the same as your talent.</em>"</p>
<p>But it's too late, and Ghondor had sensed it too. "<em>Sounds nice...Hurgggh... I like it.</em>" And with relieved, she finally reached the end of her life; motes evaporated and filled the vicinity. Sena walked forward sadly towards Ghondor, felt the motes brushed over her and rose to the sky.</p>
<p>"Shania..."</p>
<p>Ghondor looked at her hands whom had sent her on just now. Clenching it, she stood up, toughened her heart. Looking at Sena, she gave her a nod, and she nodded in return. Then, looking up at her floating motes, Ghondor promised, "<em>We'll make that world. Ourselves.</em> We'll make it real." The spiraling signaled her relieved ending.</p>
<hr />
<p>Gently caressing on a memorial stone, Sena took her hands off. The Ouroboros group and Ghondor were reminiscing her loss. Monica stood some distance behind and waited for the group.</p>
<p>Just then, Shania's mum appeared; her emotionless and shameless voice called from the distance, "Oh, do stop. You're wasting your time with that."</p>
<p>Sena was curious, "Huh?"</p>
<p>Stopping a distance away, she continued, "How much longer will you drag our family's name through the mud? So she met her end as a Moebius? Please... <strong>What a pathetic child</strong>."</p>
<p>Ghondor was upset, shouted at her, "<strong>SAY THAT AGAIN!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Her mom was more straightforward, walked towards her and took her shoulder. Ghondor was surprised at her mom's action. Feeling scared, "<strong>URRRGGGHHH... M-M-Monica? Wh... What now?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>URRRRGGHHHHH!!</strong>" She felt like punching her in her face but calmed herself, thrusted her back thereafter.</p>
<p>"Arrrrrggghhhh..." As she was freed from her grip, she quickly ran away, like a prey running away from a predator.</p>
<p>After she'd left, Sena: "I thought maybe... parents would be closer to their kids somehow. Like that warmth we felt would go on throughout their lives. I thought... that might have been the answer we were looking for..."</p>
<p>Monica, being a mother herself, answered her, "It's an illusion." Sena turned to what she had to say, "It's a fact of life that the child is born of the parent, but that's all it is."</p>
<p>"So everything that we're trying to achieve, is that an illusion too? <strong>It's all... just a big lie?</strong>" Her hopes were dwindling, her anchors were disappearing, her tone teary.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Sena..."</p>
<p>"Whether it ends in a lie or not is up to you. We all have to crawl face down in the mud, believing... we'll come out smiling."</p>
<p>"Mother..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Table's set</strong>, by the way."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Such a change of tone, change of topic.</p>
<p>"Let's fill up that tum." It wasn't what she's used for -- emotions, as a City Elder. She turned and walked towards the venue; and Ghondor watched her mom turned away, but never was the same again.</p>
<p>Sena turned to look at the memorial stone once again, reminiscing Shania's final words...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Sounds nice... <em>I like it.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"You think Shania... was able to smile?"</p>
<p>Ghondor turned to the stone, paused to think for a bit before calling out, "Next time round... <em>she'll be fine.</em>" And they nodded at each other, wishing her a better rebirth.</p>

<p>From an elevated ledge, the Ouroboros overlooked the Castle ground where the Homecoming took place earlier.</p>
<p>"I can't help but wonder... Would I have been able to save you?" Noah recalled M's final smile before she disappeared. "<strong>I wanted time to stand still... More than anything. I felt completely powerless, I wished time would stop. If the moment could have lasted forever, we... I wished for the unthinkable. Just like N. I proved to be just like him...</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio took his arms with both of hers, gently caressing his bruise on his knuckles. He turned to look at her, wondering what's she has to say, "For my part, this is all I need."</p>
<p>"When did... you two...?"</p>
<p>"It was when we first fought against M. Ever since then, M and I were swapped around."</p>
<p>"I see... I... honestly thought you were M, back there. You had me fooled! ...Maybe that's a bad way to put it. In any case, I didn't realize at all."</p>
<p>"I did try my best. I couldn't afford to fail. If anyone suspected me, you'd have all been executed on the spot. <em>But her feelings...</em> I couldn't simply let them go to waste."</p>
<p>"M's... feelings...?"</p>
<p>She nodded and shared, "She wanted to give you everything that she knew about N, to help us escape... to break this never-ending Moebius curse..." The sky served as a background for reminiscing, "<strong><em>To lose, and lose, and still stand back up, even in the depths of despair...</em></strong> She wanted you to have the strength to defeat those at the root of that despair."</p>
<p>"She sure had a lot of faith in me. Ohh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>She believed, that if anyone in the world could make it possible, it would be you. That's why... she merged our wills so we could act, to further our goal.</strong>" The words that she spoke to Noah while she was imprisoned...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"To live, and learn... a whole lot more... Noah..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smile that she had back there before her disappearance...</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's been fun, Noah!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Earlier, you said 'it was fun'... But it wasn't you, it was M..."</p>
<p>"<em>I really think she meant it.</em> It was brief, but... Being who I am now... <strong>Passing my thoughts along, on to you, and receiving yours in turn...</strong> She was... <em>grateful</em>..."</p>
<p>His iris dimmed a little, "<em>I see...</em>"</p>
<p>"From that moment, M's words were my words, and my words were now hers. Her life was scattered on the breeze, but her memories, and her will, live on inside my heart..." Her iris activated the half-moebius half-Ouroboros symbol for a brief moment. Then, inviting Noah, "<strong>Come. I have something to show you.</strong>" She immediately took steps forward and the others followed without question.</p>
<hr />
<p>On their way down, they met Ghondor, whom asked, "Where are you going?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Just over there, to Hope's Rest. I'll be back soon. The other 'me' had something she wanted Noah to see."</p>
<p>"He's gonna see <strong>that</strong>?" After thinking for a moment, "Yeah, I'm coming too."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Come on. Let's go. Hope's Rest is a summer stroll from here. Just get off the transport Levnis, saunter out of the west gate... then keep going till you see the hill with a sea view. Easy-peasy, eh?"</p>
<p>"Yes." Turning to Noah, "OK, let's go!" Together, they leave for the Castle main gate.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group (without Ghondor) arrived at a protruded platform (cliff) that overlooked the sea below. Disturbed the clear blue was remnants of some rusty structure, mostly immersed in water.</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "Here?"</p>
<p>"M was still unsure to the very last... whether to show you the memory of this place. But... I think it would be best. This place... It was everything to N."</p>
<p>"W-What do you mean...?"</p>
<p>"Well, you see... This is where the City once stood."</p>
<p>"<strong>It did?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It was long ago. The City back then, it was much more prosperous than now. It positively teemed with people."</p>
<p>Taion hypothesized, "So then, it must've drawn Moebius's ire even more than now?" To which she nodded in return.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-memories-4"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-4">Start of Memories</a></h4>
<p>Inside the cinema room. Noah jumped up with eyes wide opened as he saw Mio laying on top of a coffin-shaped platform, a beam shone directly on her.</p>
<p>Z: "There it lies before you... Your heart's desire. There is no life within. You must <strong>breathe it into her</strong> <em>yourself</em>." Then, he spoke something which we couldn't hear; but Noah gasped at what he'd spoken.</p>
<p>"<strong>Life from the people of the City...?!!! YOU WANT ME TO END EVERY ONE OF THEM?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Why the hesitation?</em> Existing in 'this place' is by itself a result of your own choices. You are the one who chose the 'endless now', <em>are you not</em>? Your response should already be predetermined."</p>
<p>He turned to Mio, then turned to Z, quietly asking if he can have both. Nudge is a powerful force to help you choose -- "<em>Such a shame...</em>" Glowing red eyes and Mio started to evaporate before his eyes.</p>
<p>He started to panic, "Ah! <strong>WAIT!!! PLEASE!!!</strong>" Holding out his hands, he recalled M standing at the end of the junction waiting for him; he didn't even look at the other empty roads with no one accompanying.</p>
<hr />
<p>N approached the City. They watched his arrival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mio's narrative: "The City's inhabitants were the descendants of M, N, and others who became Ouroboros in the past."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>N pulled out his sword.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In exchange for the lease on life they would get as Moebius, Z ordered N to kill the City's people."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Flames raged the City. N was the only person still standing.</p>
<p>M, now revived, walked and stood beside the 'emotionless'{{footnote: at least he maintained his posture outward.}} N, watched the raging flames, in desolation, "Oh no... <strong>Tell me! TELL ME WHY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I didn't... want to lose any more."</p>
<p>"<strong>What do you mean, 'any more'?! EVERYTHING WE HELD DEAR IS GONE! YOU TOOK THEM ALL AWAY, AND YOU DARE TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS OF LOSS?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>He slowly looked towards Mio from the tip of his eye, emotionlessly replied, "Now you... will continue to exist as Moebius. The same... as myself."</p>
<p>"Huh..." This isn't the Noah she knew from before. "<strong>So you did it. Sealed our fate...</strong>" With tears in her eyes, "Now we can live forever. <strong>But this future's been stamped out before its time.</strong> And... <strong><em>I can't even disappear.</em></strong>"</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories-4"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-4">End of Memories</a></h4>
<p>Noah looked at his own hands, imagining as if he had killed the City people himself. Then, clenching them into fists, "Only two things were important to him... Impossible... <strong>How could one ever choose between them? Surely he couldn't... do it...</strong>"</p>
<p>"And yet... he did make a choice." The moment he'd chose to walk on that junction; that's a choice already made. "No one can truly judge him, for the things he did." Mio recalled how he gave his final advice to his son before he disappeared.</p>
<p>"Repentance."</p>
<p>"Mhm..."</p>
<p>"<strong>The intentions they left behind...</strong> They turned into us..."</p>
<p>"Mhm... Of course it's heartbreaking, but..."</p>
<p>"But still, she was smiling..."</p>
<p>"<strong>We have to change things.</strong>" They had made their decisions.</p>
<p>"Yeah. And this time, we'll succeed." Turning to the others to ask for their permission, "So it's set. <strong>Our new goal.</strong> Agreed?"</p>
<p>Taion: "Yes... He can't get away with this."</p>
<p>Lanz: "I'm not feeling... very forgiving, either."</p>
<p>Eunie: "But guys... now we know there's an even bigger bad behind that snuffer."</p>
<p>Sena: "Z... Making someone choose the impossible...? <strong>It's so cruel!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah agreed with her. Turning to Mio, she nodded back to him. And so he announced, "<strong>Thanks, everyone.</strong>"</p>
<p>Just then, Ghondor appeared out of nowhere.{{footnote: She said she'd come with them, but she was no where seen after they'd arrived and Mio started her story.}} "Looks like yer minds're made up." She picked out something from her pocket and tossed it at them, "'Ere, this is yours."</p>
<p>Mio caught it in her hands; the Cloud Keep key.</p>
<p>"<strong>By the by... Who is that Z sleazebag?</strong>"</p>
<p>"He's something like the head of all Moebius. Or so it seemed... I've only met him in... the memories that M showed me, though... We now know his power is vast, far greater than any of the others in Moebius."</p>
<p>"Damn, so he's..."</p>
<p>Mio acknowledged, "Yes. <strong>He</strong>... is our true adversary. The one who formed... the world we know." Recalling Noah's first time meeting Guernica,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Just who decided that this... was how it should be? <strong>If I knew who they were, or where, I'd...</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>In the cinema, Z watched what they were speaking and doing all along, emotionlessly reacting to their futile and useless actions.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor: "Before we blast Z to his just deserts, first we have to find the Queen of Agnus, right?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Right."</p>
<p>Mio: "But I'm not sure right now is-" She turned to look around her friends.</p>
<p>Lanz: "What's this, you worried about us?"</p>
<p>"I mean... You were all locked in a prison cell for all that time... And you're still hurt from the fight with N..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Oh whatever, all we need is a bit of exercise and a stretch. Get that good blood pumping."</p>
<p>Ghondor, "Oh yeah? Well, am I ever pleased to hear that. If you can move, then help clean up the square you went mental on."</p>
<p>Noah agreed with the chore she handed them, "Ah, yes, we probably should." The rest had no objections on that.</p>
<p>"Then it's a deal! I'm heading back to the Castle, so get a shift on."</p>
<p>"OK." Noah took a final look at Hope's Rest City remnants. The other had leave except Mio, whom called for his attention,</p>
<p>"...Noah?"</p>
<p>He turned to her, "Let's go." They dropped behind the others therefore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor finished giving instructions to two Lost Numbers before turning her attention away. Lanz was seen hauling the scraps of a Levnises together with Sena. Riku inspected the remains to see whatever can be retrieved. Mio and Manana helped out with the injured soldiers. Noah, after finished talking to a Lost Number, went away.</p>
<p>Taion was seen examining another junk levnis by himself. As he stood up, he sighed, "Ahh..."</p>
<p>"Feels like we have one less worry now, eh?" He turned and saw Eunie approaching.</p>
<p>"Agreed... They should be able to start on repairs now."</p>
<p>"Not what I meant, though... I meant this whole thing." She pointed to her neck{{footnote: If you don't already know, that's where Mio's term symbol was.}}.</p>
<p>"Mio, that's right... At that moment, everything just felt so utterly hopeless that it hurt. There wasn't a thing I could do."</p>
<p>Cheerily, "But it still worked out, right?"</p>
<p>"Heh... Thanks to all of you being there."</p>
<p>In a teasing elongated tone, "<strong>Ohhhhhh!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Surprised you didn't choke on those words."</p>
<p>"Well, of course not! I can express <em>some</em> emotions."</p>
<p>"Tuh huh huh!"</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky, reminiscing quietly, "<em>There has to be... a reason we met... hmm?</em>"</p>
<p>"Say what?"</p>
<p>"It's something that Noah said once."</p>
<p>"And you found a reason?" He nodded back.</p>
<p>"We've seen one wish granted..."</p>
<p>"True."</p>
<p>"Still, we've got a way to go. This isn't nearly the end."</p>
<p>"<em>No rest... for Ouroboros.</em>"</p>
<p>"At least we've won ourselves an extension."</p>
<p>She was too lazy to think of the twist and turn. "Ahhhh, <strong>it'll work out somehow.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Eunie, am I sensing a streak of optimism? I thought you were one to worry about the details a bit more."</p>
<p>"<em>Now I've got a reliable guy... to stand by me, so.</em>"</p>
<p>His eyebrow raised as he stuttered, "<strong>Oh!</strong> Wh-wha...? And who... m-might that be, then?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ehehehehe</strong>.... That'll be my secret." And she just walked away, leaving him in solitary watching her disappearing into the distance.</p>
<hr />
<p>Evening. Lanz stretches a bit and exclaimed, "Phew! All done and dusted!"</p>
<p>Ghondor approached the group and upvoted, "Good work, team."</p>
<p>Sena: "All squeaky clean!"</p>
<p>Taion turned towards the Great Sword, asked, "We leave tomorrow, correct?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, so let's take it easy for the rest of today."</p>
<p>Riku don't agree, "Meh, but where can it be easily taken?"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Good question, the Castle's swarming with Agnus soldiers and Lost Numbers. If you aren't fussed about fancy bedding, there's a guard station in that building you can lie down in." She pointed to a direction in the same direction as where their prison were.</p>
<p>Scratching his head, Riku could only appreciate, "Is better than cage cell."</p>
<hr />
<p>"Uhhh? <strong>You wanna cut off those locks?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"No! But it's so pretty!"</p>
<p>"Hair is like lifeblood of girl! <strong>Not to be chopped like so many noodles!</strong>" Eunie, Sena, and Manana just rejected Mio's consent. The girls gathered around at a table behind the reception desk from translator's note earlier, chatting. Manana was cooking at the stove.</p>
<p>"Not exactly! I can't decide... Should I cut it, or just leave it alone...?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Why ask? Just do whatever you like."</p>
<p>Sena disagreed, "You gotta keep it long! It'd be a crying shame!"</p>
<p>"Well, this body, it's been granted to me by my other self, right? I dunno if it's fine for me to just... 'Snip'."</p>
<p>"Yeah... that's a big question for sure."</p>
<p>"Mm... The hair doesn't... just belong to me... But it's..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's what...?"</p>
<p>"It's... <strong>such a pain in the arse to wash!</strong>"</p>
<p>Surprisingly, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"Whuh?" Manana turned around and back to her stove.</p>
<p>"<strong>I just can't sparking deal with it! How she'd ever have the patience...! The washing takes ages, and the bedhead's a nightmare, and don't get me started on the latrine...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Woooooaaaa, say no more, love."</p>
<p>"Oh, Mimi..."</p>
<p>"<strong>So, what do you think?</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie decided to push the responsibility to someone else, "Uhh, well... Look, why don't you just ask Noah?"</p>
<p>Mio was firm on this issue and responsibility, "<strong>This has nothing to do with him! It's my problem and mine alone.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Is it just that... you're looking for permission?"</p>
<p>Guiltily and remorsefully, "<em>I'd also settle for a no.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Hmmm....." She met eyes with Eunie, decided to pass it on to her.</p>
<p>"Tch... Right then, let's sort this out. We'll decide for you if you want. But afterwards, you'd better not come crying, got it?"</p>
<p>Full of elation and eagerness, "<strong>Mm! I won't, I promise!</strong>"{{footnote: Here is where you can choose, as a player, to whether kept her hair short or long. And if you regret it, you could always change it in the setting; the game maker had not been so cruel at forcing you to stay with your decision forever.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>The guys met outside with Ghondor the next morning in the Castle ground. In the background, the Agnian Levnises seemingly were repaired, and were 'breathing' and guarding the ground.</p>
<p>Noah: "The Cloudkeep, you say?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Yes. It's where the Queen of Agnus lies sleeping." Looking at the key in her hand, she continued, "And this is the key we need to get there."</p>
<h3 id="start-of-memories-5"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-5">Start of Memories</a></h3>
<p>One dark night, raining, M stood at the edge of a cliff. As she quietly immersed herself in her thoughts, someone sounded from behind,</p>
<p>"You could throw yourself off, but it wouldn't be enough... Such is the fate of a Moebius. You should know by now." Shocked, she turned around and saw Queen Nia walking towards her.</p>
<p>"I-it's you...!"</p>
<p>"We've met before, when you were still human."</p>
<p>"Your Majesty, m-my Queen...!"</p>
<p>"I will go to sleep, for a good long time indeed. That should keep me out of Z's claws... Take this." After M took the Cloudkeep key from Nia, she continued, "Whenever it is I wake up again, the world... will be ripe for a change. Until that time, keep it safe. You should give it to those who deserve it."</p>
<p>"How will I know who...?"</p>
<p>"They'll come before you. Of that, I have no doubt."</p>
<p>"But why choose me?"</p>
<p>"Because you... Nay, the two of you, one day... You will certainly meet... your true selves."</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories-5"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-5">End of Memories</a></h4>
<p>Noah looked up at the sky, trying to take in what the Queen had said. "Our true selves, huh...?"</p>
<p>Taion was checking on the Iris, "I must say, I'm surprised by the location. It's right in the vicinity of Gamma and 9. How has it escaped detection for all this time?"</p>
<p>Zooming into the map, Mio explained, "The area around the keep... It's absolutely swimming with black fog. And there's optic camouflaging on the structure itself. So that'll be why."</p>
<p>Sena: "Is that all from M's memories?"</p>
<p>"Mhm, all stuff she passed on to me."</p>
<p>"Crazy..."</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "Ghondor, you knew M?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, from a pretty long way back. She's the one who gave me that bloody thing in the first place." She's pointing to the Cloudkeep key now on Mio's hands.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-memories-6"><a class="header" href="#start-of-memories-6">Start of Memories</a></h4>
<p>Two Agnian ships set camp one night in the desert{{footnote: Dannagh Desert, where Ethel's Colony was located at previously.}}. In between the ships was a campfire. Automated levnises (unmanned robots) patrolled and guarded the vicinity.</p>
<p>On a platform some distance away from camp, Ghondor attended to a tornado that sends visible smoke-like swirls in the distance, until the sound of teleportation brought her attention to its source. M approached her slowly; Ghondor didn't get defensive despite seeing a Moebius.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-memories-6"><a class="header" href="#end-of-memories-6">End of Memories</a></h4>
<p>"She said you lot were our last hope. Asked us to lend you our assistance and junk." The sky was a bed for recalling, "She musta been guarding the Queen's words. Yeah... For proper yonks and yonks, and no mistakin'."</p>
<p>Lanz prompted, "And that's also the reason that you were waitin' for us? Cooped up there, all that time?"</p>
<p>"Busted!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "And the 'thousand lives' thing? What... was all that?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Nice spiel, right? I wrote it!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Are you serious?</strong> Snuff, that's a letdown..."</p>
<p>"<strong>You what?</strong>" She lashed out at Eunie.</p>
<p>Noah just watched them teasing each other, turned to his team and instructed, "Let's head out as soon as we're ready. Moebius are still out and about... We don't have to worry about Mio's lifespan any more, but we can't just sit around. OK?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah, definitely. Erm, guys...?"</p>
<p>In unison, "Hmm???"</p>
<p>"There's a place... other than Cloudkeep, that I <strong>really</strong> need to go to."</p>
<p>Taion: "'Really need'...? <em>It seems you're rather troubled.</em> Are you certain it's really that vital?"</p>
<p>"It's Colony Omega."</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Omega?</strong> Wh-? <strong>No way... It's still there?!</strong>" She nodded.</p>
<p>"The Colony I lived in with Miyabi... It was under the control of Moebius Y. I learned something important from the other me. Miyabi's... still alive." She got into her appreciation stance as she recalled her moments with Miyabi.</p>
<p>Noah: "This... Miyabi... She clearly means a lot to you, then."</p>
<p>Nodding, she continued, "I'm happy to leave the decision to you. Of course, we can head for the keep first. This is something personal for me."</p>
<p>"Right, I hear you. <strong>OK. To Omega.</strong> If Mio's saying she has to go there, then we will. We'll make it high priority."</p>
<p>"<strong>Thank you, Noah.</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the cinematic room. N was sitting cross-legged, head down, clearly in deep depression. X teleported into the room and immediately complaint, "Hmph... This stinks... Frickin' Sword of Origin thing... You made me look like a complete idiot."</p>
<p>An unknown Moebius with big fat body commented, "The unexpected doth come to pass. Deeply fascinating."</p>
<p>"Yeah, but what's the plan? You're not gonna wanna let it <em>slide</em>, surely?"</p>
<p>Z: "We acknowledge and accept. Whether outside... or indeed within, <em>all</em> is part of the flow."</p>
<p>"Maaannn, you're like a brooooken reeeeecord."</p>
<p>"It is, after all, part and parcel of my being."</p>
<p>"Hmph. I'll just do things my way, then." She turned and be ready to leave the room, "<strong>Ouroboros... They're nothing without what we gave them.</strong>" Then, the fat Moebius teleported to near X; she turned to him: "Hmph! Got a problem, Y?"</p>
<p>"I, shall claim primacy." Then, he teleported off without even waiting for her reply.</p>
<p>"Hmph!" She turned instead to look at the unworded N one last time before teleported off the scene. Only Z left watching over him, wordless, emotionless.</p>
<hr />
<p>In a grassy field beside some tall rocky cliff with autumn-leaves-like trees sparsely filling the environment, Noah looked attentively at his sword. "So, I... just pulled it free."</p>
<p>"Noah mean Lucky Seven?"</p>
<p>"Mhm..."</p>
<p>"Well, seem like it."</p>
<p>"It's not changed one bit." On the middle of the sword's central circle (a glass piece) displayed the Ouroboros symbol, as it always had been.{{footnote: Really? One didn't know if it has been, one just said. You'll need to prove one wrong!}}</p>
<p>"Well, obviously. Shape just cosmetic."</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>"People and Ouroboros also not change. Before pull free, Moebius power not affect it either."</p>
<p>"Right, mm."</p>
<p>"Lucky is... simple contraption. What actually matter, Noah-"</p>
<p>"The will of the... wielder."</p>
<p>"If understand, then why ask?"</p>
<p>"<em>Just who</em>... are you?"</p>
<p>"Riku just Riku, common variety Nopon."</p>
<p>"And how's a common Nopon get his wings on this?"</p>
<p>"As said, received from masterpon to keep safe."</p>
<p>"<em>Really?</em>" Not every believable his words.</p>
<p>As before and as usual, he rebutted, speeding up his words, "What Noah possibly think? Riku mustard up some big fancy lie?"</p>
<p>"Ahahah..." He turned his attention back to his sword.</p>
<p>"What Riku say funny?" He was really really bothered by his fame!</p>
<p>"<strong>Nah, all good. We'll say I believe you.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Meh-meh? Riku bothered by that wording.</strong>"</p>
<p>After sheathing his blades, he stood up and replied, "Don't worry, I think I get it now."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>He turned to look in the direction in an empty space, Riku followed look. Taion was dealing with a pot, maybe some soup? Manana stood near him on the same table, preparing food. Sena and Lanz were doing pushups. Mio and Eunie sat across a table and chat over Taion's tea. "Nonetheless, Lucky Seven is something we'll have to cherish as we go on. Riku... thanks a lot." He turned to look back into the distance, land that looks like the shape of a monster. Riku just smiled without replying, turning to look in the same direction as he did.</p>
<hr />
<p>The melody played while Cammuravi and two others dealt with some monsters in darkness. As they killed the monsters, Miyabi stopped playing her melody after the three sheathed their blades, putting down her flute.</p>
<p>"Marvelous! Deft motions with nary a sign of hesitation. The footwork... Remarkable." Y entered the scene and gave his praise. "Thee especially... Oh, how gladdened I am to have awoken thee. <em>Miyabi... My most valuable puppet...</em> <strong>Guide them forth, with thy inimitable melody.</strong> These waifs, these immaculate strays..."{{footnote: Y had a parrot-like iris.}}</p>
<p>All their eyes red, like Ethel's when she was under control. Beside Cammuravi stood two masked figures, one Agnian, one Kevesi. The puppets had no will to reply, nor does Y wanted one.</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on Environment:</strong> Snow carpeted every single tile of land, some weighing down leaves and trunks, burying any undergrowth. Mountain goat strolling, searching for the scarce food in their habitat. Icy stalactites hung from cliff walls, with its sharp-pointing tip suspended from the barely-protruding parts of the wall. Ice skeeters, Eagles, and other animals made an ecosystem. This, is <strong>Captocorn Peak</strong>, of Aetia Region.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Upon arrival, the group overlooked the frozen view in silence; but Mio had something lingering in her mind.</p>
<h4 id="start-of-mios-memories"><a class="header" href="#start-of-mios-memories">Start of Mio's Memories</a></h4>
<p>A dome-shaped Agnian Ferronis covering one part of half-barren-half-lush land, with other camps and training grounds set up in front of it. Agnian soldiers, including the young Mio, were training. They had a competition-like training, vaulting over obstacles. Other's did it with difficulty; Mio easily wrapped herself around a wall 1.5 times her height.</p>
<p>From the side, Sena was standing with 3 other helmet-Agnian, watching the race. She was trailing her, trodding as Mio swooshed past, ensuring she always had an eye on her. After Mio finished, she walked towards Sena, and the latter greeted, "<strong>Whoa, nice one, Mimi!</strong>"</p>
<p>On the other side, someone was having difficulty walking through the log, stretching her hands on both sides, having difficulty even balancing herself. Every step forward risk falling. "Ngagh-" As Miyabi's torso lose balance, she dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>The instructor, a male of pale brown hair and crystal ears, pale skin, turquoise iris, immediately scolded, "<strong>Can't even get through that obstacle, Miyabi? Shouldn't have slacked in basic! 20 laps of the Colony! And pick up the pace!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hahahaha!" The crowd just laughed at her, ensuring that she felt guilty about it. Sena wasn't laughing. Mio was busy drinking water. They didn't help her either; not of their ranks anyways.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside a tent, Mio was surprised, "<strong>An off-seer? Really?!</strong>"</p>
<p>A buff guy with two crystal horns poking out in front of his eyebrow assured, "That's right."</p>
<p>"<strong>But why? I was top of the rankings, in all the training categories!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's done." Yeah, sure, one's just telling you to accept your fate, not asking you to question one's decisions.</p>
<p>"<strong>But sir-!</strong>"</p>
<p>Just then, a knock came from behind. Mio turned to look who's there while the guy, presumably the commander?, answered, "<strong>Enter.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Miyabi...?"</p>
<p>The commander continued, "As of now, consider yourselves our official... Colony Theta off-seers."</p>
<p>Mio still tried to change his mind, "<strong>But Commander!</strong>"</p>
<p>The voice was firm and unwavering, "Understand. This decision is final."</p>
<p>"Urgh..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena was swinging her hammer. Other soldiers practicing their blades. Mio, sat at the other side alone, now wearing a different attire (presumably an off-seer attire?), reminiscing her training days. Only that now she had her Agnian flutes by her arm and she can no longer join in. She felt disappointed. As her emotions turned lower and lower, wanting to cry at why fate did this to her, Miyabi nervously sounded from beside,</p>
<p>"So, did you... learn the score?"</p>
<p>Mio turned up a little, looked at her from the top of her eye-tip without directly facing her, softly and calmly replied, "Mhm, I guess..."</p>
<p>"So you can play it?" Miyabi also had her off-seer attire, though its hem is green; unlike Mio's orange.</p>
<p>"More or less..."</p>
<p>"<strong>That's so cool! And your part's so much harder than mine as well... I've been trying,</strong> but I'm struggling a bit with... the start of the 12th bar..."</p>
<p>"Can we please just... drop it?" She didn't have the heart to talk about it. Miyabi, being last, may have been excited she don't have to train. Mio, on the other hand, loves training and be on the top of the rank.</p>
<p>"Oh...!"</p>
<p>"We play tomorrow... I just wanna get it over with."</p>
<p>Her tone suddenly picked up pace, "Y-you're right, yeah. Sorry..." Then continued softly, "Ah... Well then! I'll practice, and make sure I've got my part down pat." Then, she walked away.</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio could just sigh, still couldn't get over with her new role.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-mios-memories"><a class="header" href="#end-of-mios-memories">End of Mio's Memories</a></h4>
<p>"Shall we go, Mio?" Noah's voice brought her back from her reminiscing. Looking at him, she gave a quiet nod, and the rest leave. Noah didn't even look at her attentively, to sense if she had more to say, or what she meant wasn't what she was trying to mean. She stayed back for a moment, just to sort out her memories for a moment, before finally took off behind the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>Overlooking the snow white lurking the distance, hearing the howling winds blowing at the junction, Mio, still immersed in her thoughts, puffed out a sad breath. Noticed some junks on the ground, she walked towards them, trying to figure them out. Softly caressing the burnt objects, she thought she can feel, or perhaps hear, Miyabi's melody...</p>
<h4 id="start-of-mios-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#start-of-mios-memories-2">Start of Mio's Memories 2</a></h4>
<p>Mio and Miyabi were sending the fallen off. Standing atop a platform that could overlook the whole battlefield, blue motes rose from everywhere. The effetely alive Agnian soldiers slowly slumped their way back home, too tired to even converse. Mio blew it with eyes wide opened; Miyabi was totally immersed in her melody, eyes closed to feel the environment. Despite playing it, Mio's heart wasn't there, only <em>the</em> melody.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back inside the barracks. Mio sat herself on her bed, looking at the flute, still lingering on the disappointment of becoming an off-seer.</p>
<p>"Hey!"</p>
<p>Mio looked up and saw a cat-ear dark-skin girl by the entrance, "Nadja...?"</p>
<p>"What's up? Fine-tuning?"</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah...</em> Got another... battle tomorrow..."</p>
<p>"Bit of a waste, ah? And you're suck a slick fighter too... <em>Can't believe they paired you with that klutz Miyabi... I don't know what the commander was thinking...</em>"</p>
<p>That seemed to speak to her heart, "Uh...? Ahaha..."</p>
<p>"Eh, at least you get to take it easy. Low risk of dying, when you're in the rear guard." Is that a compliment, or a compliment?</p>
<p>"<em>Uhm...</em>" She could hardly retained her smile. Maybe feeling betrayed? Or feel to have betrayed them?</p>
<p>Then, some female with crystal ears called out, "Nadja! We're waiting for you! Mission briefing?"</p>
<p>And she shoot, "Cool, be right there!" Turning to Mio, "<strong>Later!</strong>" And she dashed off to join them. Mio, not anymore. Still holding her flute, still feeling depressed.</p>
<hr />
<p>The evening sun scorched the sandy environment; so much sand dust it seemed to shroud the views. Above stood Mio and Miyabi; and some soldiers below exclaimed, "Guess we live to fight another day!"</p>
<p>Another female voice urged, "C'mon, let's head back."</p>
<p>"To be fair, we scored some good points today!"</p>
<p>Another male voice, "Tally's next week, was it?"</p>
<p>Mio stood in front of Miyabi; they weren't playing their melody. Mio, hearing their discussion, tried to ignore it, to turn herself away from what she could've joined if not for <em>this</em>. No time to think; time for the melody.</p>
<p>As they finished, Mio commented, "This is all... <em>such a waste...</em>"</p>
<p>Miyabi heard her, "What is?"</p>
<p>"Everyone else is out collecting life, and here we are, noodling our tunes... What use are we really...? To the colony and everyone?"</p>
<p>Miyabi don't even need another second to think, "I think it's obvious. We can only truly contribute... after death, is all." She walked forward by her side, looked at Mio attentively.</p>
<p>She can't be convinced, shot back, "<strong>'After death', though</strong>? Isn't that just pointless? We could be playing our hearts out here, and nobody'd even see us."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Is that right?</em></strong>{{footnote: Now this is a good sentence to ask whenever you thought someone was stuck in their flawed conclusion. You don't tell them what to do; that don't work. You asked them to question their own assumptions instead.}}"</p>
<p>Mio took no second thought at it, "<strong>Sure it is!</strong>"</p>
<p>Miyabi turned to the battlefield, asked a follow up question, "<strong>Mio... Is that why you're here, for recognition? is that why you're being an off-seer? For a commendation?</strong>"</p>
<p>Perhaps she felt bad, tried to rebut, "No, it's just... <em>duty</em>...?"</p>
<p>Bending down, hugging her feet together while in a squat, arms wrapped around her legs, Miyabi continued, "You know, I'm actually glad I was born a klutz."</p>
<p>"...I bet you're just scared."</p>
<p>"Mm... It is scary... fighting. I am afraid... to steal others' lives with my own hands. Actually, I'm impressed that it comes so easy, to everyone else."</p>
<p>No second thought, "It's just natural. We all of us live to fight."</p>
<p>"<em>You're wrong.</em> We just have to... We fight to live, that's all."{{footnote: <strong>Invert, always invert!</strong>}}</p>
<p>"Huh?" That was a new concept to Mio.</p>
<p>"<em>Mio... Have you ever touched a mote of light from a Kevesi?</em>" Mio shook her head, and Miyabi continued, holding out her palm as if she could feel it now, "They're the same as ours. On the other side, the people live hoping the same things as us. <em>It's a sad fate</em>... Still... if we're forced to live this way... the least we can do..." and she stood up, "is this." And she played the melody with full heart and full zest, at the top of her lungs. Blue motes evaporated faster and filled the whole air, surrounded her and Mio. Mio watched the motes, not joining.</p>
<p>Down there, Nadja was standing in front of a corpse, probably one of her friends, and looked at the motes rising too, feeling the motes brushing through her. Tears rolled down her cheeks thereafter.</p>
<p>Miyabi, after finishing her melody, wished, "Fly high! Ever higher! Goodbye... and... thank you... <strong><em>To send on the voices of the departed, is an off-seer's purpose...</em></strong> It's not a waste at all, so long as those voices speak to you..."</p>
<p>"Voices...?" She hadn't yet understood, but the seed had already been planted. It'll take time to grow, but surely it will.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mio! Miyabi!</strong>" They looked down and saw Nadja shouting at them. Wiping off her tears, "<strong>Thanks, guys!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio held on to her flute even stronger and brought them close to her heart, strengthening her conviction. She had did something useful after all.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another day on the battlefield, both playing the melody after a battle, in unison. It was morning daylight. Mio opened her eyes to watch the Motes rise. In the distance laid a tall Kevesi Ferronis, probably abandoned after the battle.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-mios-memories-2"><a class="header" href="#end-of-mios-memories-2">End of Mio's Memories 2</a></h4>
<p>As she caressed the levnis remnants, her memories drifted to an end. Looking at the sky, she hoped to see her again.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the night falls and the group was about to arrive at a junction with cliff walls shielding one side of the junction, Eunie suddenly dropped to the floor, reverberating, "Brrrrrrr.... It's so cold I might fall over..." The wind was breezy; and icy breeze is no fun.</p>
<p>The group heard her. Mio took a look around, "Hrrrrrr... Should we take, a breather?"</p>
<p>Noah effetely replied, "Sounds good..."</p>
<p>Taion agreed, "The cold of the highlands is no joke. It would... definitely be a good idea to rest up."</p>
<p>Looking towards a campfire along the cliff wall, Mio questioned, "How about that spot, over there?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah, that looks good. Let's go."</p>
<hr />
<p>Gathering around the campfire, Mio was still dwelling in her memories, until Noah questioned, "Mio, can you tell us more about Colony Omega? I've had glimpses when we Interlink, but what does it all mean...?"</p>
<p>"Right... I'll try." Then, turning to her left, "Sena, is that OK? May I?" Yeah, she was also involved!</p>
<p>"Yeah, <em>I don't see a problem with that. You can tell them.</em>" She acknowledged and started recalling,</p>
<h4 id="start-of-mios-memories-3"><a class="header" href="#start-of-mios-memories-3">Start of Mio's Memories 3</a></h4>
<blockquote>
<p>{{footnote: Anything within this (speech) is narrated.}} Five years ago,the three of us were footsoldiers in Colony Theta. One day, with no reason given, we were transferred to Colony Omega.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By a camp in the late afternoon; the sky was gloomy. A Ferronis was in one area, and other camps too. This certainly wasn't the camp from before; the setup and the Ferronis were different. In the assembly, Mio, Miyabi, Sena, and other soldiers lined up in a grid. The Ferronis had a purple Flame Clock burning 5/8 of its way, attached to the top of its head. Mio looked at the very different Flame Clock that they now had. A Moebius appeared after the group had gathered, slowly walking towards them. It was Y.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We didn't fight. Rather... we were subject to daily examinations for no clear reason.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Miyabi was put on a screening bed, with green light screened over her like a scanner while she was (probably) unconscious. The machine looked like one of an MRI. Beside the scanning bed stood Y. Outside, Sena and Mio watched from behind the semi-translucent glasses.{{footnote: i.e. dark-tinted.}} Not just them, the other soldiers were also there; they were lining up waiting for their turn.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then one day, there was a... an accident.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The purple Flame Clock suddenly got unstable and burst. The Flame inside evaporated into purple gas dissipated rapidly, filling its surrounding, including the inside of the building. It filled up so fast the soldiers weren't able to react to it, still lining up waiting for their turn, even as it blew past them.</p>
<p>After Y teleported away, and soldiers suddenly falling to the ground, only did they finally realized. A few struggled to run, but the gas had devoid them of oxygen; they dropped to the ground with both hands on their neck, trying to expand it to no avail, finally falling to the ground.</p>
<p>As Miyabi shouldered the effete Mio through the channels, an explosion to the right tunnel that conjoined the current tunnel they're traversing; they're lucky it missed. Miyabi cared not the strangers. She just wanted to get the half-unconscious Mio out of the affected area, slowly waddled forward.</p>
<p>As Mio woke up, still dizzy, "Miya... bi...?" More and more explosion shook the building. It also interrupted their supposed conversation, if there will be any. Miyabi brought Mio through a small door by the side of the tunnel. Then, softly placing her inside the escape pod directly behind the door, she said,</p>
<p>"Just wait..."</p>
<p>"Aah..." Mio was effetely laying her back against the pod, one hand on the door, as she watched Miyabi turned back. An even stronger explosion near where she was; the flames lit up her face. She faced to her side to shy away from the dust and smoke. Along the corridor, Miyabi reappeared after the explosion, again slowly waddling towards where Mio was, this time dragging Sena along. Purple smoke slowly diffuse from behind; they were running out of time. It was catching up with her.</p>
<p>As she finally threw Sena beside Mio, another explosion happened, shaking the escape pod bay. Holding by the door, Miyabi held out her flute with another hand, calling out, "Mio. Take this... I'm giving you my whole self. So please... Live life in my stead."</p>
<p>Still effete, "Miyabi..." But she was unwavering, pushed forward her flute. Mio subconsciously took hold of her flute, and Miyabi released it. With a final smile, "Thank you..." Before the purple flames diffused into the bay, she pressed on the button; the door slammed shut, and purple fog shrouded Mio's view on Miyabi.</p>
<p>"Hrrrrr...." Mio launched herself forward by a shook, hands against the thick glass, trying to look out of it. Miyabi had already activated the escape pod. It zwooshed through the escape tunnel as Mio shouted from the depth of her lungs, the depth of her heart, "<strong>MIYABIIIIIII!!!!</strong>" And flames filled the tunnel where Miyabi previously stood.</p>
<p>As the escape pod zwooshed into the night sky, Mio watched the purple explosion engulfed the whole Ferronis. The brightening flames comparable to a nuclear detonation blinded their view. Nothing she could do.</p>
<hr />
<p>Along the desert, some cars drove along. Inside were soldiers sat around the floor, along the edge of the truck; including Mio and Sena.</p>
<p>Sena took time to blame herself, "<em>I... I couldn't do a thing... I wasn't any use... None at all...</em>"</p>
<p>With tears herself, "Sena... <em>Miyabi was a hero... All that an off-seer ought to be...</em> she put it in here," All she had left was the flute now on her hands, "and she gave it to me..." Putting the flute against her heart, to embrace... "Truly a... hero..." That doesn't prevented her from wiping her tears, nor feeling desolate for losing someone dear. "I decided. I'll find it for myself. I'll leave my mark, on others and the world. This lifetime... <em>that Miyabi gave to me... I'll use it well!</em>"</p>
<p>Amidst the thundering weather, the few floating transporting Levnises moved in a row through the desert for their next destination.</p>
<h4 id="end-of-mios-memories-3"><a class="header" href="#end-of-mios-memories-3">End of Mio's Memories 3</a></h4>
<p>"Regret all you want... but the past, can never be changed. But... <strong><em>you can change who you are in the present.</em></strong> If I was stronger then... Like now... I might've been able to save everyone..." Turning to Noah for his opinion, or maybe, asking for a peace of mind, "<em>Is it wrong to think that?</em>"</p>
<p>"Not at all." That was Lanz before Noah could answer. "I feel you. <em>I know I wish I'd been stronger... back then</em>." That was Joran thrusting him out of the flames and the rubble.</p>
<p>The breezy wind blew in the background as each immersed in their own thoughts. Nimue's watch was in Taion's hand.</p>
<p>Mio continued, "So yeah, I want to go back there, with that in mind. And now I have the chance."</p>
<p>Taion, coming out of his reminiscence, questioned, "Mio, what kind of Colony is this Omega? I never even knew it existed."</p>
<p>Lanz agreed, "Yeah, our side didn't know about it either."</p>
<p>Eunie counted in her mind, "We've got... what, 23 Agnian colonies, in all? They go up to Psi."</p>
<p>Mio: "Good intel."</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey now... don't go lumping me in with Lanz. I took my education seriously.</strong>" Now Lanz turned his head on her, rebutted,</p>
<p>"Ah, shaddap. Don't flatter yourself!"</p>
<p>Mio continued, "Colony Omega was... an independent entity. It never engaged. The name it used was Agnian, but even that... wasn't the whole truth. Omega's administrator... was the Moebius Y. He was... performing some kind of experiment there, using us as guinea pigs. I don't know what he was doing. M wasn't briefed on it either. All I can remember is... that oddly-glowing... violet Flame Clock."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>A Colony that doesn't fight...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Never knew that was even a thing."</p>
<p>"Y's restored it now. Colony Omega, I mean."</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "You know this from M?" And she nodded.</p>
<p>Taion wanted another perspective, "Sena, anything to add?"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, "I don't really know much about it... The accident happened... <em>pretty soon after we were moved</em>."</p>
<p>"I see..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Omega's existence... the tests... It was all Y. That's just... the Moebius he is.{{footnote: Yeah, scientist/researcher.}}"</p>
<p>As Sena recalled and recalled and recalled, suddenly, something struck her mind, "<strong>Ah...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion pressed on, "Do share."</p>
<p>Turning to Mio, "Mimi, remember? Didn't we see <em>the same color... on Ethel and Cammuravi's Ferronises?</em>"</p>
<p>"Hrrrrrrr!" She didn't recalled until she mentioned!</p>
<p>"I could... be wrong..."</p>
<p>"No, you're spot on. <strong>Good call, Sena! I didn't think of that at all.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Really?" And she nodded back.</p>
<p>Turning to them, Mio continued, "Ethel and Cammuravi had their lives taken. And in that accident, so were the whole Colony's... Most likely, Y was... running experiments that could potentially prove fatal to us soldiers."</p>
<p>"And now that the Colony's back... You're thinking... <strong>Miyabi's still in there!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah.</em> <strong>That's why I have to go... To end this. He's toyed with our lives as he pleases for long enough!</strong>"</p>
<p>"...Exactly. I'm with you! <strong>Let me go too!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion was confused, "We're all going, I thought? Right?" And Noah agreed with him.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Obviously. Let's go, Mio. To Colony Omega." Mio turned to the rest of the group; they all agreed.</p>
<p>"Everyone, thank you. This time, I'll do the saving!"</p>
<hr />
<p>In front of a huge door, with several street lights guarding its entrance; looking up was a Ferronis of Omega; it's hands holding a stick that resembled the staff; it's head was still a Flame Clock, still purple{{footnote: Though seen afar, it looked orange, but given a closer look, it's actually purple.}}. Miyabi stood in front watching, while Y started his speech, slowly walking up to her, "The brilliance doth please. For ceaseless eons, we Moebius, have abidden apace with this world. Yet with drawn-out abiding, many lost sight of the pith thereof... dissipating slowly, as doth the world." He was referring to the annihilation events that were slowly swallowing the lands of Aionios.</p>
<p>Hugging Miyabi from behind, she didn't reject{{footnote: Well of course, a puppet couldn't reject.}}; he continued, "The brilliance of life is exigent. More dazzling than now... If we wish... to save the world..." and his Moebius iris glowed, to signify that Moebius were the saviors, and would be the only saviors of the world. The purple flames within the Flame Clock glows brightly, as if about to burst with his control. Miyabi watched innocently even as the purple caressed her face.</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah and the others just knocked down a bunch of soldiers. They noticed something out of place, "Wait a sec..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "They're a mixed unit?! But that's just not possible!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Possible or not, it's what we've got to deal with right now. We'll just have to adapt."{{footnote: Well said. Can't care about the 'why' if you got the 'how' to solve...}}</p>
<p>"Tch..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Unusual... They might be stretched thin."</p>
<p>"Huh?" The rest of them asked for clearer explanation.</p>
<p>"If it's like Mio said... and they've been running an experiment out of Omega..."</p>
<p>Taion got it, "These soldiers are evidently one of the results!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Keves and Agnus... What kind of experiment could involve both of them...?" She turned to Mio for clarification.</p>
<p>"I don't know. But... I do know... the answer lies ahead." The Ferronis wasn't far away anymore, just a short climb.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ungh...!" Eunie fired his rifle at one of the soldiers. The Keves soldier tilted his head up to dodge her shot, but it removed his helmet. As she tried to get another shot, she was shocked. "<strong>M-Mwamba?!</strong>" Alas, his iris was red, clearly under control.</p>
<p>Another Agnian soldier removed his helmet. Mio recognized, "<em>Hackt...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "They've been... reborn?"</p>
<p>Eunie rebutted, "No... i-if that was the case, wouldn't they be way younger? Mwamba looks like he did this term!"</p>
<p>Lanz sheathed his weapon and shouted out, "<strong>Mwamba! It's me! Lanz! You know me!</strong>" No he don't. He pointed his rifle at him and fired a few shots as a reply. Lanz drew his shield to block, calling out in the meantime, "<strong>S-stop it! Mwamba!</strong>"</p>
<p>On the other side, Cammuravi sent flames that aimed at Lanz's defense. Taion noticed and sent his Mondo in front of his frequency shield, blocked it for him instead. Cammuravi slowly walked into the scene from afar.</p>
<p>Taion: "And now Cammuravi?! What's going on?" Clearly they saw him dead, turned into motes before their eyes? Cammuravi didn't reply, withdrew his weapons and ready for a fight.</p>
<p>Before they engaged, the tune of Miyabi sounded, echoing the environment.</p>
<p>"This Melody..." Noah looked around to sense its source. Mio finally found her behind Cammuravi. Ripples ricocheted as she played.</p>
<p>"Miyabi!" Mio immediately sheathed her weapon. Sena lowered hers,</p>
<p>"It's Miyabi?"</p>
<p>Then, Y teleported and stood beside Miyabi.</p>
<p>"Y..."</p>
<p>Noah: "So that's... Y."</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Miyabi! It's me, Sena, your friend! We came to save you! You don't have to fight for him any more! So, stop, and come along with us!</strong>" She couldn't hear her; her melody kept echoing.</p>
<p>Y spoke for her, "Save thy breath."</p>
<p>"Hhhh!"</p>
<p>"The revenants neither remember nor feel. Only... the instinct... to fight tooth and nail <em>for survival</em>." Then, he removed his helmet to reveal a huge pale-skin face, with those purple lightning-bolt strikes Z had on his face, but much more pale. He had huge, thick eyebrow, giant nose, red iris, and everything huge. Continued, "Normally, they would undergo basic conditioning in a cradle prior to be awoken. As you all once did... They would fight for 10 years, <em>before returning to Her Majesty</em>."</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't impressed, "What a piece of work..."</p>
<p>"These younglings... They live for the sole purpose of battle. They are just... as you are."</p>
<p>Noah rebutted, "<strong>You're full of it! Our memories and feelings, they define us. They dictate who we are! When you take all of that away-</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>'Tis a phantasm</em>." Nope, not planning to hear what you had to say. "Fundamentally... memories and feelings... are but tacked-on extras, an afterthought."</p>
<p>Taion couldn't understand how he could've thought like that, "<strong>'Tacked-on'? Cut the crap!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, they are as sheep.</em> You are simply deceiving yourselves, wishing to divine some meaning, from something, that is <em>devoid of it</em>. "</p>
<p>"<strong>Urgh...</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "<strong>Why are you doing this? What's your goal!??</strong>"</p>
<p>"Merely the betterment of life for Moebius."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"For such is Z's <em>humble desire</em>..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Z!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It is Z who wove <em>the fabric of this world</em>. Consequently, we who are his avatars enjoy powers <em>beyond mortal ken</em>."</p>
<p>Sena: "Moebius are Z's... 'avatars'?"</p>
<p>"The gift I was imparted... is the creation, <em>of Flame Clocks. Must I say more?</em> I hold the life of every soldier, <em>in the very palm of my hand</em>!"</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"Indeed, <em>the Flame Clocks</em>... They are part of my very being! Ethel and Cammuravi's Flame Clocks... <em>Those were some of my <strong>finest</strong> work</em>. Did they not thrill you? <em>The ebb and flow of their lives...! Ahhh....</em>" He wiggled around as if you're enjoying life with a drink, or a puff.</p>
<p>He changed his tone from enjoyment to excitement, "<strong>Then</strong> did it <em>strike me</em>... Like unto a flame, human life also doth glow and glimmer brightest just afore it is quenched. And hence... <strong>There can be no greater nourishment!</strong> <em>Indeed...</em> This Flame Clock is therefore my <em>proudest creation</em>. The <em>final year, when life is at its most dazzling! A Clock, that gives rise, to a sublime instant!</em> 'Tis a Flame Clock most radiant!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Final year...? So that's it! Mwamba and Cammuravi... You brought them back close to their Homecoming!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Y...!"</p>
<p>Eunie bit her teeth, "This is all kinds of screwed up... I've never met anyone I wanted to punch more...!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Yeah... Even for Moebius</em>, he takes the biscuit!"</p>
<p>Y had lost his patience, ordered, "What is the matter? <strong>Proceed with the killing</strong>! Let your function be fulfilled, <strong>and kill</strong>! And I, <strong>shall raise you up</strong> as many times as needed! <strong>With my Flame Clock</strong> <em>ablaze</em>!"</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>He's mad...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Come!</em> <strong>COME!!!</strong> <em>Let mine eyes</em> <strong>feast!</strong> Upon the <strong>BRILLIANCE OF YOUR LIVES!!! HERE, ANON!</strong>" And he teleported out of the scene.</p>
<hr />
<p>Everyone was panting heavily.</p>
<p>Eunie complaint, "Ugh, Mwamba... When did you get so strong?!" Miyabi's melody was still playing behind the scene, with Y beside her again.{{footnote: Not sure when he teleported back, though.}}</p>
<p>Taion: "Cammuravi too. The last time we fought, he was in a Ferronis, but he seems to be even more driven this time round! <strong>Sparks!</strong> is this, their fight or flight instinct...?"</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Poor Miyabi</em>... <strong>They're strong</strong>, <em>all right... But...</em> that's all they are!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Taion didn't understood.</p>
<p>"The melody Miyabi used to play? <strong>It wasn't like this!</strong> There's no way it was ever this sad!"</p>
<p>Mio: "So then..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah... They're hollow. There's no will behind their actions. It's not our old friends that we're fighting here... It's something else!"</p>
<p>Y wasn't scared of holding back the data of his experiment, "An astute <em>observation, yes. It is so</em>. <strong>Owing to the basic</strong> conditioning of lacking, their psyches are rather... <em>unstable</em>. The melody you hear serves to prop them up. An off-seer... <em>conveys</em> peace <em>to their cohorts</em>. <strong>They enable them to</strong> realize dreams. That is what I focused my efforts on, <strong>and</strong> iterated!"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's wrong! You can't use the off-seers!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Au contraire, <em>au contraire! Behold for thyself.</em> The mental instability is assuaged, and their movements adhere to the base specifications. Certainly, there is no will behind it, but 'will' is an undesired side-effect!"</p>
<p>The group was speechless for a moment, until Sena broke the silence, "Evil..."</p>
<p>Mio launched herself forward beside Noah, "You can't do this... Not to Miyabi... Not to our off-seeing rites... How dare you use them to your own ends!"</p>
<p>Noah recalled his past exchanges with Crys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crys was tucking his flute to his pocket as Noah commented, "That's a good tune. A Crys original?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose it is." They were by a battlefield.</p>
<p>"Maybe I'll pinch it as well."</p>
<p>"You've got your own tunes, Noah. Those are... just as good. Wonderful, I'd say..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Really?</strong> I only... tweaked a few notes in a score from my previous Colony..."</p>
<p>"It's not the notes that matter... <strong><em>It's the feelings you imbue them with.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Feelings?"</p>
<p>He nodded, explained, "Raw emotion... It resonates."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<strong>MIO! IT'S FEELINGS!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Feelings?" Not understanding what you're speaking about.</p>
<p>"<strong>It's the off-seer melody we've been playing. We just need to play it again now. She's an off-seer</strong> too. I know for sure it'll reach her!"</p>
<p>Mio looked at Miyabi attentively for a second, thoughts rushing through her heads, before replying, her tone excited by Noah's, "<strong>Of course, yeah. Our melody, just like always...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Sheathing her blade and taking out her flute, she continued, "<strong>Understood! I'm taking the lead. You follow!</strong>" And he nodded, stuck his sword into the snowy ground before taking out his flute too!</p>
<p>Taion was confused at such illogical actions, "Noah, Mio, what're you-?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Wow, good thinking, you two."</p>
<p>"Huh?" He still didn't understood how logical that could be. Sena already rushed off in front of him.</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm saying</strong>, this might actually work!" And the formed a semicircle in front of the two, to shield them for the moment. "C'mon guys, defend! Lanz! Sena!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Arright!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sure thing!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Their melody together sent ripples like Miyabi, but it's two against one. While they were doing that, the battle do not stop. Mwamba shooting at Lanz, Eunie knocked him off, trying to aim and shoot at him, but Cammuravi was coming after her. The flame was blocked in time by Lanz's frequency shield. Taion's dealing with Hackt, the latter dodged and got near him. Shocked by the lack of time to block, Sena knocked him off on time while sending Taion off-balance a few step back. And we'll skip the rest of the movements.</p>
<p>The ripple from Mio and Noah's produced a sharp noise that pricked Miyabi's; she temporarily stopped hearing the ear-pricking tone. Losing Miyabi's tune, the other soldiers' might were greatly reduced. Even standing on their feet is a burden. Y put his arms around Miyabi's shoulders and spoke something on to her ears. That brought her back under control.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hackt and Mwamba dodged the frontline with Cammuravi 1 vs 4, launching themselves up into the air aiming for the two. But their tune is so strong it affected not just Miyabi, but also the launching two -- they can hear the high-pitch noise! Together with Cammuravi, they dropped to the ground, no longer able to fight. Their head too painful to continue.</p>
<p>Even Y put his hand on his head, confused, "Huh? What in the...?"</p>
<p>Mio was trying to convey via the melody{{footnote: 传音。This is thoughts in the mind directly appearing in the thoughts of someone else's mind.}}: "<em>Miyabi? Hear me? It's me, Mio. Remember?</em>" Memory fragments of them first being selected as off-seer appeared, and other sceneries. Mio continued, "<em>That day, when you first explained to me the purpose of an off-seer, softly. That fateful day, when the lights of life danced into the sky, so high... Ever since that day, I've... I've done my best. To play that melody... you trusted me with.</em>"</p>
<p>Miyabi still tried to play, being under controlled, but it's been too hard. She no longer can. "<em>Miyabi... You gave me newfound life, back then. Now, let it be my turn.</em>"</p>
<p>Slowly putting her flute away from her lips, she softly, cryingly sounded, "<em>Mio...</em>" Tears slid down the side of her cheeks as her feelings and memories reemerged. Unfortunately, her eyes was still red under control, "<em>...help me...</em>" And she bent down, palms against her head. Y saw it and tried to move near her, to reassure her.</p>
<p>"<em>Just wait, Miyabi. I'll be with you soon...!</em>" Lucky Seven seemed to have heard their desire to free them; golden motes emanates from it as it vibrates more and more vibrantly, releasing a shockwave that cleared them of control. Y looked around to see what the spark is that light.</p>
<p>As for Mwamba and Hackt? "Urgh..." "<em>Mio...</em>" before they fell to the ground and be unconscious temporarily for the rest of the battle. The redness in Miyabi's eyes dissipated finally.</p>
<p>"Mio...!" Mio had already put down her flute, gave her a smile, and welcomed her friends' return. She was too exhausted; only one eye before falling to the ground, unconscious too.</p>
<p>Y was in shocked, "Huh...? <em>How can this be</em>...?" Putting his arms on one side of his head, shocked more at his failed experiment, perhaps, "Their memories... <strong>Their minds ought to have all been scoured clean...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Y... An off-seer's melody, it's more than a sequence of notes. It is shaped by feelings; those of the player and of the ones being played for. All I did, was shape the feeling Miyabi passed to me, and play my heart out!"</p>
<p>Shaking his head furiously in denial, "Inconceivable... <em>You were able to override Z's precepts</em>...?! No Ouroboros <strong>should command that sort of power!</strong>" Then, something caught his eye, "<em>The Sword of the End?!</em> <strong>That's</strong> what's behind this reprehensible act?! <strong>Well then... I shall just have to ascertain the matter!</strong>" Both his iris glowed Moebius, certainly stronger than the single-iris moebius. Purple sparkles glowed as he transformed to Moebius; even the shockwave released was much stronger than any of their previous enemies.</p>
<p>Sena: "Oh spark! He's coming!"</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Now</em> he steps in?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "He's even chunkier than that K guy..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>That</em> is a lot of chunk...!" Not only larger in side, but the ratio of chest to hip was much much larger, perhaps 10:1 or something, to exaggerate the size. "<strong>Noah! Mio! C'mon!</strong>" Final enemy before reunion!</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah! Take him down. Then we can free the Colony!" They already took/recalled their blades.</p>
<p>Y: "Since <em>you vermin are no longer bound by the Flame Clocks</em>, my Moebius power sadly holds no <em>sway</em> over you... Ergo!" And he punched his fist together that made the sound of metal clashing against one another. "<em>At this late hour, I will bring my mind, spirit, and flesh to bear</em>, and <strong>batter</strong> you all into oblivion! Come...! <strong>Come! COME!!!</strong> <em>May the</em> <strong>bloody sport commence!</strong>" He had 3 pairs of fingernail-like spikes on both his arms. The others are either too hard to describe, or doesn't appeal too unique to the translator.</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena's Ouroboros dashed towards Y, swung her hammer and knocked him flying backwards. Taion's Ouroboros, while Y was in mid-air, formed a gyroscopic bond around him. Sena: "Noah! It's time! Quick, set them all free!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Cut the Flame Clock, now!"</p>
<p>Mio's Ouroboros made a jump past Y, Noah took over, cut the Interlink, and sliced it in half.</p>
<p>Y, seeing that nothing could be turned back, calmly announced, "A creditable effort, <em>Ouroboros</em>. Reviving their <em>memories is no small feat</em>...  And how <em>scintillating a display</em>...! Now take that brilliance in hand, and spread it wide, and in so doing illuminate the world <em>therewith</em>! I shall be watching... <em>eagerly</em>!" As his last words done, he didn't even need to break free of Taion's binding, just able to teleport into thin air.</p>
<p>After cancelling the Interlink, Taion was shocked, "He got away..." The soldiers previously down on the floor now awake, slowly getting on their feet, watching the purple 'lives' floating back down. Perhaps into themselves? We don't know; it seems just to be floating around, neither entering any body nor went anywhere.</p>
<hr />
<p>Miyabi wasn't even awoken until it was parting time. With Cammuravi and the others far far away, not able to eavesdrop, Mio, accompanied by her group, had the chance to speak to Miyabi herself. "Miyabi..."</p>
<p>Sena also called out, "Miyabi..."</p>
<p>"I've, uh... I've been listening all along. The melody you've been playing. Every day, since then..."</p>
<p>"Yeah. Miyabi, thanks to you... I sent on so many. So many voices to so many others. And I'm not done yet... <em>I'll keep going</em>...!"</p>
<p>She agreed, "It was a gorgeous melody. Yours... and...?" She turned her head to him.</p>
<p>"Noah. Nice to meet you, I guess. Though I already feel like I know you."</p>
<p>"Noah, huh? Yours was very beautiful, just like Mio's."</p>
<p>"I owe it to this." And he brought out the flute he exchanged with Mio, Miyabi's original flute. He tried to return it, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>"No, you... You hold onto that."</p>
<p>"Oh... I-I'm sorry. I'll wash it. It'll be as good as new...!"</p>
<p>Mio giggled at that, "<em>Dummy...</em> That's not what she was trying to say at all."</p>
<p>"Wait, why am I...?"</p>
<p>"Right?" And she nodded.</p>
<p>"From me to Mio, and from her to you... The feeling, is passed on. <strong>Until you can make your voice truly heard</strong>... please, keep it with you. Yeah?"</p>
<p>He paused for a moment to process what she just said, before unwaveringly answered, "I will. If that's how you feel, I'll be more than happy to keep using it."</p>
<p>"Take care, then. <strong>Mio...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"{{footnote: Surprised.}}</p>
<p>"You've become the greatest off-seer I've ever seen." Surprisingly, Miyabi's term symbol was still 9th-term, like Noah and the others, also on her neck like Mio's.</p>
<p>Now that's flattering; she humbly replied, "...Oh, there's still room to grow. But at least, I've found my stride. Since I'm... not alone." She looked to her right and left, and others nodded back to her.</p>
<p>Nervously asked, "Could I, uh... come with you?"</p>
<p>Mio immediately walked up and took her hands, "Of course. You're back, Miyabi."</p>
<p>Sena happily put both her hands on the two's as well, stacking them up, looking attentively and smiling at Miyabi, also welcoming her. "We really missed you!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mio, Sena!" And the stack of hand would bond them until the end of their days.</p>
<p>{{footnote: After this, Miyabi joined the group in-game.}}</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note:</strong> If you'd love to know more about Miyabi, watch out in the <a href="/93_miyabi.html">appendix section</a>. There'll be one on Miyabi after she moved to the City. It's optional and doesn't affect the main story.</p>

<p>This is a separate story from the main one, that talked about Cammuravi, and later, Ethel. Feel free to skip this one and go to the next. If you did not, assume that, after finishing this story, the Ouroboros would be back on their track.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Cammuravi, per se, shielded the defenseless colleagues comprised of both Kevesi and Agnians outside Y's experimental colony. It was a dark evening; the sun cast just enough light to reveal the Lost Numbers encircled Cammuravi's group. Cammuravi took to the offensive, swaying his lance{{footnote: Actually, one still don't know what to call Cammuravi's weapon. One sometimes called it lance, other times called it pike, and other times called it spear. So, just bear in mind, all of it means the same thing.}} that brought flames that burned so close it reddened the face of the Lost Numbers. "Urgggg... I thought... I thought we injured him?!"</p>
<p>Cammuravi deepened the crease in his eyes as he got more cautious of the possible pain the Lost Numbers could bring to him and his mates. That did scared the Lost Numbers a little, "Urggg..."</p>
<p>But not all. Another ordered for unconditional surrender, "You can stop resisting now! Victory is already decided. <strong>Surrender quietly!</strong>"</p>
<p>To which he replied, "<strong>Enough</strong>! You will find... I don't do as my foes bid me."</p>
<p>"The enemies you seek..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." He was alerted by Mio's approach, quickly slammed his pike into position, pointing at her face.</p>
<p>She showed no fear despite, finishing her sentence, "are no more."</p>
<p>"It's you..."</p>
<p>"Your senses returned suddenly. You must be feeling confused. If we startled you, we're sorry." Then, she turned to the Lost Numbers and commanded,  "Everyone, please put away your weapons." They turned to their head of the team, whom agreed with the sheathing.</p>
<p>Sena felt nervous, "Mimi..."</p>
<p>"It's OK. It's Cammuravi. He wouldn't attack a defenseless opponent."</p>
<p>"What makes you so sure?"</p>
<p>"I don't believe it's consistent... with the Warrior's Way you follow."</p>
<p>They were looking at each other's eyes to seek for more information. Mio showed unwavering faith in him. He therefore sheathed his, exclaimed, "...You've got some guts." Then closed his eyes and got into a meditative posture. After the other Ouroboros joined in, he continued, "You must want something of me. I'll hear you out."</p>
<p>Taion did the introduction, "I'll start from the end. We want you to come to the City with us."</p>
<p>"City? Which Colony is that?"</p>
<p>Sena scratched his head, "Is it a Colony...? How to explain...?"</p>
<p>Taion: "It's a special place. Safer than where we are at present. Of course, we don't intend to hold you against your will or force you into anything."</p>
<p>"Then what has it to do with me? What do you seek to gain from this?"</p>
<p>"We want you... to live true to yourself."</p>
<p>"True to...? Explain."</p>
<p>Noah took the stage, "Someone once showed us it was possible... to live life as we wanted to. We want to pass it on... and let you be free."</p>
<p>"Free...?" The word triggered an intense throbbing in his left eye as he raised his hands to covered it, trying to ease the pain. "Urgggg..."</p>
<p>Mio was alerted, "Are you OK?"</p>
<p>"I-it's... nothing. Just a little twinge."</p>
<p>Sena hypothesized, "Could it be... Miyabi's lingering influence?"</p>
<p>Cammuravi rejected, "<em>No, this is innate</em>. I can't see through it, but it's fine."</p>
<p>Noah and Mio looked at each other, the latter speaking, "Remember the fight with P and O...?"</p>
<p>"It could be from that. That pain was the price. What Cammuravi paid for freedom. Or maybe... still does."</p>
<p>"About what you asked of me before. I have one condition." He turned to signal to the others he'd shielded, including Hackt and Mwamba, whom had lost their direction, senselessly and nervously looking around, wandering and wondering about their future. "Promise me that they will receive the same treatment as I."</p>
<p>Noah reassured: "That was our intent from the start. You needn't worry on that count."</p>
<p>"I thank you. Whatever the circumstance we find ourselves in, the crucial question is always, <strong><em>how do we live...</em></strong> They will realize it too, before long." Standing up, he continued, "I wish to find the path I should tread... To discover my Warrior's Way. For now, we're traveling companions, headed for this place you call... the 'City'."</p>
<p>"Thank you. You will be welcome there."</p>
<p>Mio changed the subject, "By the by, Cammuravi... How are you with heights?"</p>
<p>"In what sense?"</p>
<p>"I thought you might be startled, so I wanted to give you a heads-up."</p>
<p>"...Hm?"</p>
<p>Noah lightly spoke out, not willing to call out the surprise, "You'll understand when you see it. We'll let you know once we're ready to go."</p>
<p>"Understood. I await eagerly." Poor soul, you didn't know what you'd waited for.</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship took off headed for the City.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I am a leaf on the surface of a lake... I-I am a stone, warming in the sun... " Cammuravi slowly blinked his eyes and saw his feet on the metallic tile ground, but that does not ease him. He closed his eyes back and chanted, "I am the clouds on a windless day... I am the reed that bends but does not break..." He therefore opened his eyes, looked at his clenched fist and legs, slowly tilting up. Manana stopped to look at him, and his focus was on the ground in front of her. Looking afar, the group had already walked some distance. As he saw the short building in front, the empty space (plaza?), and the lights escaping the windows in the far vicinity, he could not resist but passed out.</p>
<p>Some moment later, he was meditating on the ground, with Sena reassuring him, "You can relax! We've landed now."</p>
<p>Noah: "Guess he didn't like heights after all..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Funny, considering how gung-ho he was riding around in his Ferronis."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, OK, but... I don't think we should talk about the past in front of him... He's just been born, and in a tenth-term body...{{footnote: One don't remember the scene for this, but Y had mentioned they'd been reborn and accelerated to their tenth-term, if you'd remember.}} I'm sure he just wants to focus on the here and now..." Seeing how Lanz and Noah looking at her, she don't understand so she asked, "What're you smirking at?"</p>
<p>Noah answered, "Oh, just... You're a genuine good egg, Eunie."</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh? Where did that</strong> come from?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey there!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Hey, Travis!" They turned and saw him running up approaching the group.</p>
<p>He was in an emergency, and quickly spit out his words, "Man, am I glad to see you guys. Something terrible's happened, you won't believe it... Oh, but no word of it to the boss lady, yeah? <em>My salary's on the line here!</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz pushed for the actual, "That's a corker of a preamble, mate. you gonna actually tell us what's going on?"</p>
<p>"Somebody opened one of the cradles."</p>
<p>Noah: "You think it was an intruder?"</p>
<p>"I don't know! But there weren't any obvious signs of it. The soldier inside has gone missing as well. Someone you knew, I gather? It's, uh... <em>Uhhh, tch, come on, it's on the tip of me tongue...</em> Y'know, what's-her-name... Uhh... <strong>With the silver hair?</strong>"</p>
<p>"No way... <strong>Ethel</strong>?"</p>
<p>"That's it, Ethel! <em>Urggg, why is all this happening on my watch...?</em> Ah, never mind, now's not the time for reflection."</p>
<p>Eavesdropping all along, Cammuravi approached the group and offered, "If such is the situation... I shall assist as well. Where shall we look?" The group looked at him for a pausing moment, making him feeling dumbfounded, "...What?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Erm, we were just... surprised? That you were so, er... concerned...? Uhm..."</p>
<p>"I am also recently of a cradle born. <em>It may be some kind of <strong>fate</strong> at work. This soldier named Ethel, she may also find herself at a loss.</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, thinking in his head, "<em>So he... didn't actually remember...?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"And also... You... good sir."</p>
<p>Travis: "Huh? Me?"</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "You must be frightfully exhausted... <em>Do not push yourself</em>, please."</p>
<p>"Heeey, watch it, fella. I know I'm no spring chicken, but there's no need to rub it in!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Sorry mate, he's just been born... I'm pretty sure he didn't mean anything bad by it."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Anyway, moving along! Movement in and out of the City is strictly regulated, so if there weren't any incidents reported so far... both the perp <strong>and</strong> Ethel must still be <em>somewhere inside</em>."</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah, you're right. Let's first search for clues in the module warehouse."</p>
<p>"Good luck to ya, whippersnappers! In the meantime, we'll take custody of the friends you contacted us about."</p>
<p>Sena was concerned, "They're called Mwamba and Hackt... <em>What's gonna happen to them?</em>"</p>
<p>"They're not quite back to themselves yet, right? We'll... give them a checkup, make sure they're all there. And after that, well, keep 'em under observation, I s'pose? <strong>Either way, you can leave 'em with us.</strong>"</p>
<p>Cammuravi: "We leave them in your able hands, then."</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah... Yeah, sure thing</em>. They'll be safe as houses. I'll be in the war room. Keep me abreast of any developments."</p>
<hr />
<p>The cradle lying on the ground, opened, empty. Observing from the module warehouse behind the glass windows, Sena announced, "Well, it really is empty..."</p>
<p>Taion: "It's definitely Ethel's module. But <em>why would anyone want her...?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "If we wanna know that, we just gotta catch 'em. And whaddya know, they left us a clue. <em>Nice of 'em.</em>" Footprints on the ground, huh!{{footnote: Now this seems weird, how do they went pass the glass windows from this observation room? Instead, there should be another door in the warehouse where a transporter used to enter and exit that should be accessible to that room, not this room separating via glass windows. And none of the windows are broken! Not to say there are no doors from this room to the warehouse!}}</p>
<p>Mio analyzed: "There's footprints all over the place... They seem to be in a rush."</p>
<p>"They're not Ethel's, are they? But then, whose...?" Who have triangular foot?</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "We only have to follow them to find out. They can't have gone too far. Let's get going."</p>
<hr />
<p>A blue Nopon standing atop a building overlooking the City, on the ridge as if he was prepared to jump off it and end his life. "Mehhhhh.... What Cubibi do now...?"</p>
<p>Mio and the group had already searched till here, "Um, excuse me...?"</p>
<p>"Meh-meh?!" He turned and saw himself surrounded by the group, thinking they're here to capture him.</p>
<p>"C-C-Cubibi sorry, sorry, so sorry!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "We haven't even said anything yet." Well, that's the culprit in shame!</p>
<p>"Cubibi know without saying! Friends come looking for naughty boy Cubibi! Cubibi never meant to do any harm... Cubibi just... Just want to enjoy game of Ultimate Hide-and-Seek..."</p>
<p>Cammuravi was more interested in "Hide-and-seek... What is that?"</p>
<p>He temporarily forget his situation, excitedly announced, "Is ultimate pastime of daringly go and hide where not allowed to go."</p>
<p>"<em>Daringly...? Defying a prohibition?</em>"</p>
<p>"Meh-meh?! Cubibi please asking to not make scary face!"</p>
<p>Taion brought back the main topic, "So why did you open the cradle, then?"</p>
<p>"When get on panel, it open by self! And when it open, girl wake up... Cubibi really-truly sorry..." And tears flowed from his eyes like fountains.</p>
<p>Cammuravi: "We get it now, so... wipe your tears. Look, you're getting your tummy wet." And his tears subsided like a fountain losing its water supply. "And what happened afterwards? Did you go somewhere with the awoken soldier?"</p>
<p>"Cubibi get scared and flee from scene of hide... But can tell morely or lessly where she go. Cubibi think it direction of Centrilo Parade." The group went over to the fence overlooking the City, and Cammuravi started chanting his Warrior Song again,</p>
<p>"I am the morning mist in a pine grove... I am mythrice, growing across seasons..."</p>
<p>Cubibi was shocked what the heck is he even doing, "...Meh? Friend OK?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Don't mind him, he's just, ah... trying to <em>maintain</em> his cool."</p>
<p>Sena: "I updated Travis on the situation. He says he's coming to collect Cubibi."</p>
<p>"<strong>Is Cubibi in serious troubles...?</strong>"</p>
<p>"I don't expect him to be too severe, but <em>you will need to do some repenting</em>."</p>
<p>"Meh meh meh..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Let's leave Cubibi in Travis's hands, and go track down Ethel. She looks quite distinctive. Someone on Centrilo Parade should have noticed her."</p>
<p>Cammuravi had finished his chanting, "You are right... Yes, let us go."</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>Ethel!</strong>" Noah shouted as he and the others ran towards her. She was trying to climb a giant metal container-like building, fingers clinging on the edge of the room and legs pushing against the bolts. Hearing his call, she temporarily lose focus and thus her grip, falling towards the ground. The others thrust forward their body, but only Cammuravi instinctively dashed forward and caught her in his arms. Mio closed her eyes waited for an impact that never came.</p>
<p>While putting her on her foot, he felt relieved, "Ahh, I barely caught you in time." Ethel was still examining who had approached her; the guy whom brought his face closed to hers and asked, "Y-you're not hurt?"</p>
<p>"Uhm..." And she nodded in assurance.</p>
<p>"I think... I know you. Yrgh..." The pain in the left side of his head came back haunting him.</p>
<p>"What's wrong with you?" She carefully put her fingers on his head, trying to sense it, and retracted it as he said</p>
<p>"Nothing... I just can't see. Anyway..."</p>
<p>"...Cammuravi. You're Smoldering... Cammuravi?"</p>
<p>His eyes widened by her recognition. Noah was shocked too, "Ethel, you recognize him?"</p>
<p>She looked down and spoke to herself, "I have to... go somewhere? I have to... But why?" She shook her head in confusion.</p>
<p>Mio: "Take it easy. Let's take our time, yeah? We'll help you look, no problem."</p>
<p>Looking at Cammuravi nodded to her, she agreed, "...Mm." The others walked near them and joined in.</p>
<hr />
<p>Some place inside the City, they were deciding. Taion: "Now comes the <em>tricky</em> part. What do we do from here?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "What can we do, except foster her in the City? A first-termer won't be any use in a fight..."</p>
<p>Cammuravi asked for her thought, "Do you find that acceptable?"</p>
<p>"Mmm I... <em>don't know</em>."</p>
<p>Cammuravi thought for a while before speaking, "I have a proposal. Would you leave her with me for a while?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Wait, you're saying you wanna look after Ethel?"</p>
<p>"<em>Just until she settles on her own path. I want her to have that freedom. I don't know why... but I feel it strongly.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "For now, let's see what Travis thinks. As the City's concerned too, we shouldn't decide alone."</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "Travis... I fear we will wear him out again."</p>
<p>Lanz explained, "It's not <strong>fatigue</strong> that that guy struggles with... You know what, forget it. Maybe just don't say that to him, yeah? He's kinda touchy about it."</p>
<p>"I understand. I will mind my ways around him."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the war room. Noah explained the situation and the proposal to Travis. Looking attentively at Cammuravi, thumb on his chin, "Ahhh... Well, <em>I guess I</em>... mostly understand. <em>Are you sure you can handle child rearing?</em>"</p>
<p>"Child-rearing...? What is that?"</p>
<p>"In a nutshell, I'm asking if you're capable of taking responsibility for the proper upbringing of this <em>little princess</em>."</p>
<p>"I'm not 'princess'. My name is Ethel."</p>
<p>And he just laughed at that, "Awhahahaha... Too precious."</p>
<p>Cammuravi: "If you would consent to it, I will serve for the good of the City. I am sure I have my blind spots, but I always complete the duties assigned to me."</p>
<p>Ethel: "I'll help too."</p>
<p>"...Hm? But you cannot fight."</p>
<p>"I can be your eyes, though. I can see that which you cannot, no?"</p>
<p>"By the flames... <strong>Spirited, isn't she?</strong>"</p>
<p>Travis: "Oh yeah, too spirited I'd say. Look, lemme bend your ear a little..."</p>
<p>Mio: "You don't think its going to work?"</p>
<p>"It's... not really my position to think <em>anything</em>..."</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Right... Well, I'll try talking to Monica then."</p>
<p>Now that put his salary at stake, he quickly shot, "<strong>Auggghhh!!!! OK, FINE FINE FINE, I-I get it! Let's do this.</strong> I'll take care of Ethel, and instead, we'll have Cammuravi help out on the combat side! That'll be perfect, don't you think? Eh? <strong>Eh?</strong>"</p>
<p>"You're that scared of Monica?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm scared all right! But I'm... not just trying to cover it up from sheer terror, OK? It's just... that woman takes on way more than she should. <em>I bet she doesn't know how to... take it easy. So I figured</em>, you know, I'd lighten her load by... doing this much at least."</p>
<p>Cammuravi eyes rolled up, "<strong>Your Warrior's Way is unimpeachable, sir</strong>. I will never forget your kindness. Be sure, the debt will be repaid."</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? Well, make it hundredfold, then."</p>
<p>Ethel spoke for him, "Don't get greedy, Trav."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ooooh, we're doing nicknames now?</strong> How about we start with 'Lieutenant Travis' and go from there, eh?"</p>
<p>While Ethel continued speaking with Travis on the background, Cammuravi turned to the group and appreciated, "I am deeply indebted to you all as well."</p>
<p>Mio: "Don't sweat it."</p>
<p>Cammuravi: "No, this is truly a grave debt. Especially... Taion... You said, I should live true to myself. <em>I haven't discovered</em> exactly what that means yet... <em>But now I understand what you meant at least, and am grateful to you for setting me on the right path. You were the source of the spark that set my flame alight. Thank you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Erm..." He was in shock, don't know what to say.</p>
<p>Mio nudged, "Taion, he's talking to you."</p>
<p>"I know... I-I just... n-never in my life thought I would be on the receiving end of this kind of speech. The future... Really, it's a foreign country."</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh! I suppose it is.</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'm sure in time you and Ethel will find it. The right path, the right code to live by."</p>
<p>"Yes... <strong>Until such time, I, Cammuravi</strong>, remain ready to do battle for the City, and for you as well."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As a reminder, the group would continue their path on the way to find the Queen next, at the snowy mountains.</p>

<p>Mio was traveling mindlessly, lost in her thought amidst the blowing light gale, when some soft noise broke the silence, "<em>Psst... I said, psst!</em>"</p>
<p>She turned to her right where Eunie shouldered{{footnote: One probably invented the meaning; it means, to be a 'shoulder distance' away.}} beside her, questioned, "<em>What's up?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>So, erm... you've got... M's memories?</em>"</p>
<p>That wasn't the problem, though. "<em>Eunie, why are we whispering?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Roll with it.</em>" She looked at the guys and Sena walking in front{{footnote: Lanz dropped in the back.}}. They were leading towards emptiness; perhaps some rock in the distance, and the heavy black fog, but nothing else except layers and layers of white snow that can't even melt amidst the blazing sun.</p>
<p>"I do, yeah. Why, though?"</p>
<p>"<em>So tell me stuff.</em>" She turned to make sure those in front and at the back aren't eavesdropping.</p>
<p>"Tell you what stuff?"</p>
<p>"<em>Stuff about the Queen and Moebius. Anything you got.</em>"</p>
<p>"But like, what exactly?"</p>
<p>"Like how the two are connected, any secrets, or where they are..."</p>
<p>Well, surely someone <em>was</em> eavesdropping. Lanz was blaring, "Oi, no giving out exclusives!" Since when did he caught up with them, looming large beside the left of Mio?</p>
<p>Mio: "Lanz?"</p>
<p>"We wanna know this stuff too! Right?" The others had already stopped and turned towards them.</p>
<p>Taion, scratching his head, "Well, I suppose... But still..."</p>
<p>Sena continued his sentence, "Yeah, I trust Mimi. If it was important, I-I'm sure she'd tell us everything."{{footnote: Not true. Sometimes, you just plain forgot it yourself even if it's important. We're human with fallible memories, after all. So better ask!}}</p>
<p>Noah: "And since she's not saying, there's a reason. Right?"</p>
<p>"Mhm... If it's about the Queen, you shouldn't hear it from me, but rather from Her Majesty herself, I think. The Queen's bound to know things that M didn't..." Everyone except Eunie agreed.</p>
<p>Eunie, disappointedly, "Ugh, so that's it then? You're just gonna pass the buck?"</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose so?"</p>
<p>She complaint, "<em>Feels a bit stingy, that's all.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey, no grumbling</strong>. I'm in the same Levnis as you, OK?"</p>
<p>"All right, all right. I'll yield. Might as well save my appetite for the main course!" And she just walked away, leading the way disappointingly.</p>
<hr />
<p>Reaching a pointed tip of the mountain. Still can't see anything, eh? No -- something extra. Trees of light gray trunks and white leaves! That's it. Oh no, and the group was standing by a structure that looked like a stage, with stairs going up onto it.</p>
<p>Eunie was still dwindling with the previous encounter, 'complimented', "Glad I made this journey." That refers to the emptiness, nothing to be seen.</p>
<p>Manana noted: "There nothing special here..."</p>
<p>Riku questioned: "Friends sure we come to right place?"</p>
<p>While the group scanned the surrounding, Mio was unwavering. "We're good. You'll see!" She traversed the stage towards the edge, where an altar-like feature built on top of empty abyss, a cliff to nowhere. On the top of the altar was a place to put the key. On near-field contact (NFC), the key and the table started shining blue beams, a result of activation. Wind swirled as the mechanism worked, forming a tornado. As the tornado died down not long later, a giant structure emerged out of nowhere, losing its invisibility. The structure was relatively empty. Mostly just lamps and pools of water.</p>
<p>Taion can't believe his eyes, "Is this real...? That's the Cloudkeep?"</p>
<p>Lanz exclaimed, "Whoooooaaaaa..... Fan-tas-tic bit of tech. <strong>Amazing</strong> how they kept it hidden."</p>
<p>Then, lights materialize a row of ladders that connect the entrance with the tip of the mountain, just beside the altar. Mio turned back to join the group, facing them.</p>
<p>Sena asked, "So is this where the Queen's been sleeping, then?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Right at the very top."</p>
<p>Noah: "Right, let's move. Not far now. A few more stairs... <em>We might finally discover the way to free the world</em>... End Moebius's reign."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived in front of a giant door inside the Cloudkeep. Noah: "We're here."</p>
<p>"Yes." And Mio walked forward to open the door, again by showing the key. The door opened to reveal a giant furnace-like structure{{footnote: You see that in Xenoblade 2, but we won't talk more than that.}}. As they enter, the middle was just a pool of water, with another altar in front of it. Mio NFC the key once more, and the water glowed brightly, as if sucked into the sky, forming a curtain{{footnote: The curtain looks like waterfall, but water-rose rather than fall.}}. The emptied pool revealed a stasis pod at its center. The group step forward beside Mio to take a closer look. The Queen was visibly sleeping inside.</p>
<p>A few moments later, the door automatically eject, and upon a blink of light, it disappeared. The Queen still laid in her stasis while her body functions were returning slowly.</p>
<p>"She's really pretty," Lanz commented.</p>
<p>Noah: "It's her. That's the <em>real</em> Queen of Agnus..."</p>
<p>Eunie's crow mouth{{footnote: 乌鸦嘴。}}: "She's sleeping and not... <em>dead, right?</em>"</p>
<p>Mio reassured, "Don't worry. She'll awake soon enough."</p>
<p>As if her words had magical powers, her fingers started twitching, "Uh hmh..." her eyebrows jiggled and opened, blinked for a moment as she tried to figure out where she was.</p>
<p>Sena remarked, "<strong>Ah! She's up!</strong>"</p>
<p>Nia slowly tried to sit up. Just then, a 'fingernail' arrow bolted at light speed; so fast the group hadn't got the time to register. "Urg Ahhh..." With shocking eyes, they could only watched it pierced through the stasis pod, and Nia laid back down, closed her eyes.</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>What?!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Your Majesty!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>She's been killed!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Heheheheh...." The group turned their attention towards the Moebius. It was D and J, standing atop the chamber, in their Moebius form, not interlinking. D remarked, "How delicious...! I can taste your despair already!"</p>
<p>Joran: "I'm afraid you won't get your way. We worked hard to make this world ours... No way that we'll relinquish it now." The two teleported to the bottom to face the group at same level.</p>
<p>Noah: "Joran..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You rats, how'd you find us?!"</p>
<p>D: "I don't get your surprise. That one's still half-Moebius. You didn't seriously think we'd lose her, did you?" And Mio's eyes glowed the half-Moebius symbol as they spoke. "Or did you think... you're all that just because you managed to defeat N?"</p>
<p>Mio: "Urgh..."</p>
<p>He continued, "Well, thanks to you, I got to end that aggravating old bat, fulfilling Z's orders in the process..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Looks like we got played..."</p>
<p>Lanz took few steps forward, still couldn't believed their childhood friends had became like this, "Joran... Are you... seriously..."</p>
<p>"Seriously what?"</p>
<p>"Teaming up with this creep?" D didn't say a word. "<strong>You've KILLED HER...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Wasn't that clear? You know I am Moebius. I was <em>re-born</em>, and on that day, J surpassed you all."</p>
<p>"<em>That day... Right. Then tell me.</em> <strong>Why did you do it? Trade your life for mine?! You coulda ignored me, got away safe!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Well gee, I have no idea. Hrmm... Let's see, there might be something in one of my memories... 'Maybe if I die instead of him, I'll please him?' Perhaps that's what I was thinking?"</p>
<p>"<em>One of your memories...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Since I couldn't do anything else right, you know</em>. Must be nice to be you, Lanz. <em>Just being yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Nice to be... me...?</em>"</p>
<p>"You couldn't fathom how hard it is to be useless. You'd never understand, unless you'd seen yourself in that light. <strong>Oh! Here's a thought!</strong> How about you try Interlinking with me, for a lark? I bet you'll <em>cry</em>, at the state of me!" And he started to recall how he got beaten up when he was younger.</p>
<p>He continued, "Fun fact, you know... when you become Moebius, you're 'treated' to all the memories of your past lives. I got to see all the different 'me's'." How he, a klutz, had trouble running, and the team knocked him sideways and surpassed him, not even looking at him. Another scene. On the floor, he held on to his pen/pencil, amidst the rain, dragged himself towards a notebook a short distance away. His water bottle rolled to another angle. Dropping on the floor, he watched himself being squashed by the wheels of a levnis. He knelt before Garvel and his team, face on the floor. He dragged himself back as he watched Lanz got angry of him. "Although they all pretty much met the same sad end. Dead weight will <strong>always</strong> be that... <em>I am...</em> <strong>nothing but myself!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena felt a pang in her stomach. Eunie bit her lips. Noah tried to rebut, "<strong>Those were all just coincidences! We know different!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz, finding an anchor, immediately added, "<strong>That's right! We thought... No I knew for sure, that you were awesome-!</strong>"</p>
<p>Joran cut him off, "Whatever, bet you were well and truly fed up with me. <em>Although</em>, back on that day, I still managed to surpass you! I can still be here, <strong>feel this rush! And now, I'm having the time of my life!</strong>" His tone getting more elated and elated.</p>
<p>Noah saw that words can no longer get through to him. It's time for a beating, well, at least a beating is required first to open his heart, open his ears, open his mind.</p>
<hr />
<p>D slammed against the wall and dropped 'dead'. J wasn't any good either, struggling to get up while commenting, "Must be nice to be strong like you guys! And <strong>me?</strong> I was just a worm, crawling in the dirt. But what I wanted was to fly... With every single new day, I looked up to admire the birds, free-wheeling above... <em>But I was a worm</em>."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Joran, cut the crap</em>...!"</p>
<p>"The stuff you guys said was like, if those birds went... 'But Mister Worm, you do such great work tilling the soil! It's really important you keep at it for the sake of the world, you know!' Do you see what I'm trying to say?"</p>
<p>Lanz sheathed his blade, questioned, "<strong>And what's so wrong about that?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>I WANTED MY WINGS, YOU BASTARD! I thought if only I could earn your approval, it'd be like an updraft I could soar on!</strong>" Putting his hand over his face, taking steps backward, "<strong>But birds... What can they possibly know of how a lowly worm feels?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ahah..."</p>
<p>Noah now sheathed his, "<strong>Joran... J-just how could you possibly think like that? You wanted approval, so you...</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>How could I not! That's why I became Moebius! So I could be what I always aspired to be!</strong>" That kept Noah recalling. He recalled the scene after he'd finished carving the puppet:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lanz: "Whaaat? This is <em>you</em>?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "It looks nothin' like you!"</p>
<p>"M...mm. Yeah... But, like... That's what I wanna end up like, someday. Uhuh, <em>silly, huh</em>?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<strong>LIAR!!! If you think you're satisfied being this way, you're lying to no one but yourself! I know you can't be at peace with this, so drop the act!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ungh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>And yet, maybe to you we were like birds... but that has NOTHING to do with strength, ONLY LACK OF CHOICE!</strong>" He stepped forward to push his argument forward.</p>
<p>"<em>Lack of choice...?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Just look at how the world is</strong> for us. It wouldn't... It would never allow us to take any other form. <strong>So we have to change it!</strong> For weak people like us..."</p>
<p>"Weak? <em>You're weak?</em> Ahah!" What a funny joke.</p>
<p>But Noah reassured him. "<em>On that day, weren't you smiling?</em>"</p>
<p>He retrieved it from his memory for a moment, assured, "Oh yes, <strong>I sure was smiling! BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOMENT I ROSE ABOVE YOU! IT WAS A GRIN OF VICTORY!</strong>"</p>
<p>"No it wasn't! <strong>On that day</strong>, you... <strong>That was the real you! Our friend, Joran!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hngh... <em>Stop mocking me...</em>"</p>
<p>"Look, <strong>you'd made it, Joran! You spread your true wings!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Uh Huh..."</p>
<p>Lanz cut him from his thought, stepping forward, "Joran... <strong>Your death, it changed me.</strong> Fighting isn't everything... <strong><em>I learned that if I chose, I could change myself, become anything</em>.</strong> Joran... I'm grateful as spark to you."</p>
<p>Now Eunie sheathed hers to speak, "Ain't you the same, Joran? Maybe, if you had the choice too... In a world... <strong>where nothing has to be like this...!</strong>" Seeing her sheathing and the fight not continuing, the others sheathed theirs too.</p>
<p>Sena joined in the persuasion, "And that's exactly the kind of world we want to create! We want choices!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Remember, you're Moebius! You should have other, nice memories as well! You have to try and remember them, anything at all!"</p>
<p>"Mhmm..."</p>
<p>Noah: "I... I've seen all kinds of death." The wish of Guernica, the legacy of Crys, the unwillingness of Shania, the choices of Ethel and Cammuravi. "Taken a long hard look at myself. So let me tell you. Joran, you're... You're more than this!"</p>
<p>"Ngh..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Joran, you've given me so much. <strong>You helped me find the will, to endure these ten hard years!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Come to us, please, Joran! Let's all stand together...</strong> You don't belong with them... You just don't."</p>
<p>In a crying tone, "<em>Was that also... me?</em> That day, it was like... my body just moved."</p>
<p>That reminiscing, that persuasion, was cut short when D slammed from above, smashed J on to the ground, hands on his head, "Hey hey hey <strong>HEY!</strong> Don'tcha think you're gettin' carried away there? Urgh, what a loser. You... good-for-nothing <strong>shit-for-brains</strong>!"</p>
<p>Without Joran's control, "AHHHHHHHHHH", in pain, D forced interlink.</p>
<p>"Hwaaaaaaa..." The power that came back at D. Round 2.</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>JORAN!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion was confused, "An Interlink...? He's taken him over...!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Grrrr...</strong> He's a real piece of work...!"</p>
<p>Noah: "D...! You scum!"</p>
<p>"Ever... had dreams? Dreams of dying, of being slaughtered...?"</p>
<p>"Urgh..." That was Eunie.{{footnote: The group still hadn't called their blades, surprisingly stupidly. They won't have enough time to react if the Moebius is slightly more clever, though.}}</p>
<p>"Ah, well, most people forget soon as they wake. No harm done. But tell you what... They're all completely true."</p>
<p>"<strong>And so snuffin' what? What if they were? The past is past, and the present is now!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I wasn't finished. Dreams, y'see... They're little traces of intense memories from your past lives, that didn't get purged before rebirth... Little harmless bugs in the system, let's call 'em. However... Not so with Moebius. Just like the runt said, when you become Moebius, <strong>in that very moment, all your past memories come rushing back to you.</strong>"</p>
<p>D remembered when he was an Agnian soldier. Ferronis and Levnises had his back, he dashed forward in the battlefield, using his weapons (pairs of wolf claws) to slice down Kevesi soldiers. Day, night, all the battle, no changes. He enjoyed watching the Kevesi suffered before they die. He enjoyed taking lives.</p>
<p>On one of the battle, looking to his right, he saw one Kevesi pressed on an Agnian, trying to press his sword against the Agnian's stick (pike? lance?), but was poked in the back by D before he react. The Agnian, watching he was now safe, held out his hands for D to pull him up. Yes he did, but only to thrust his weapon on to the Agnian's heart. Nothing is more enjoyable than watching your enemy and friends die before you. Nothing makes more enjoyable than the slicing of flesh and blood.</p>
<p>Then, with his weapons unsheathed, he walked into an Agnian camp, where people were still chatting and eating, wasn't aware of what awaited them. They were alerted by his entry. Some moments later, one soldier slumping out of the tent; the other soldiers were curious at what had happened. As he dropped to the ground, D emerged, slowly walking towards him, weapons in his hand. The other Agnian were immediately alerted, but they were no fight for him. He was the only one alive in the camp in the end. He was the one man colony. The colony is him, and he is the colony.</p>
<p>"To put it mildly... it's... <strong>it's transcendent.</strong>" The rest were shocked by what he did even before he turned Moebius. By choice, he became Moebius because Moebius fits him, not because he had will unfinished, like many other Moebius -- the will to not die, the will to revenge, etc. He continued, "Before coming here, I went to visit the Ferronis where I keep my collection."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Collection, you say?</em>"</p>
<p>Amidst brightness that blinded the surrounding, D the moebius opened a harsh unoiled door. Enter it and you see jars. Smiling as he enjoyed his collections, "There they were... Staring back at me!" Yeah, keeping head in jars preserved.</p>
<p>Mio: "He's mad..."</p>
<p>"Well? Huh? Doesn't it make you tingle? <strong>As long as I am Moebius, I can enjoy this superlative feeling forever and ever! I'll bury the world in my sweet collectibles!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urgh urg..." Eunie felt like she wanted to vomit hearing his words. "<em>I think I'm gonna hurl...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz shouted, "<strong>PUSH THROUGH IT!</strong>" She and Sena looked at what he'd gotta say, "<strong>First, we gotta save Joran... from this shitbag!</strong>" And he called his weapon.</p>
<p>Sena agreed, "<strong>Yeah, Eunie, what Lanz said! This PUNK needs a whoopin'!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urg <em>All right... OK, will do!</em> We'll thrash this shitbag, save Joran... And get me... some payback!" Time for second round!</p>
<p>Final words from D as he called his fingernails (double, like the wolf claw weapon he had from before)? "If you fancy your chances, take your shot. I'll be more than happy to rip your bloody pelts off, <strong>and ADD THEM TO MY COLLECTION!</strong>" Then, he sliced on the floor which broke it, and the group, together with him, fell down to the lower level. THere they had their fights.</p>

<p>Noah's Ouroboros dashed and slashed on his chest: "AHHHHHHHHH" and he flew and crashed on the wall. "Argggg can't argggg...." Amidst the bleeping noise, he struggled in awe, "I... I lost?! Impossible! I won't accept it! I am D of the Moebius!{{footnote: Another guy cursed by the 'best and brightest' cycle...}} <strong>The man who was Blackblaze Dirk!</strong> I won't be beaten by some idiot upstarts!" The others, including Noah, had cancelled the Interlink in the meantime, to save some interlink cooldown time. He struggled forward, each step was strenuous.</p>
<p>Taion: "Blackblaze Dirk..."</p>
<p>Noah: "You've heard of him?"</p>
<p>"<em>I read about him in a textbook. An Agnian soldier from long ago who'd gone mad. Rather than take lives with his Blade, he'd behead his enemies with talon-like swords, bring them back, and add them to his collection.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "So that's who we're dealing with..."</p>
<p>"Tch... Is this your doing, J? <strong>What're you tryin' to pull?!</strong> I can't crush these fools if you hold your strength back! <strong>Give it to me, you no-good dead weight loser!</strong>"</p>
<p>Joran, already awoken from the shocking statement earlier, and gradually taking back his part of the control, "<em>Dead weight loser...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Who else, kiddo?!</em> So <strong>give it up! GO ON, GIVE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Joran recalled the conversations with Noah and the others earlier,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Look, you'd made it, Joran! You spread your true wings!</strong> So let me tell you: Joran, you're... You're more than this! "</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I can be... more..." He recalled what he'd done when he shoved Lanz in that incident. The Moebius in his Iris started to glow bright red. The core start sucking black fog at unprecedented rate. Purple electric sparkles encircled the hard-to-control interlinked Moebius.</p>
<p>Lanz was confused, "<strong>Whuh-? What's going on?</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Huh!</strong>"</p>
<p>D, getting his share, "All right! That's what I'm talkin' about! With this much power, these chumps are..." He hadn't finished his words, but he realized that it's been sucking too much. The core had glowed bright orange. Feeling his body started to lose control, he fearfully called out, "H-hey, that's enough now. I've got more than enough juice to- <strong>Hey! Are you listening?! J!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>The black fog!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>I knew it!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Joran's... doing that?"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>STOP IT, JORAN!!! IF YOU DON'T STOP, YOU'RE GONNA DIE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Mrgh-! I can't move...! C-c-cut it out! J!" Joran forced him to take step backward, toward the edge of the arena. "CANCEL THE INTERLINK, NOW! <strong>MOVE YOUR ARSE! DO WHAT I SAY!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>... I will not.</em>" D had gone depressed at such bland rejection. "I've decided. It's my choice. I <em>will</em> be different." One more step and they'll fall into the cloud sea below.</p>
<p>"<strong>JORAN!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"This is who I am... <em>Isn't it?</em>... Noah... Eunie... Lanz..." The group, as if it isn't the interlinked Moebius anymore, but Joran the boy standing by the edge in their eyes, dropped off the edge as he finished delivering his conviction.</p>
<p>His eyes wide with fear, iris constricted, "<strong>J, stop-! ARGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!</strong>" Too late. As gravity accelerates them faster and faster, black fog never stopped entering the core{{footnote: For they travel faster than the falling velocity.}}. They started flaming every single orifice of the interlinked. "If I die here, I won't-! <strong>NOOOOOOOO!!!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>In a bright light dream environment, Joran seemed to meet the three again, all in their child state. Lanz, standing in the central front of the triangle, looked aside, sadly exclaimed, "Snuffing idiot... Always putting others ahead of yourself, ya moron. You should've just... <em>l-looked out for number one</em>..."</p>
<p>He smiled back, calmly rebutted, "But you were so scary, I didn't really feel like I had that option."</p>
<p>Lanz scratched his nose, "I suppose... <em>I'm sorry, Joran.</em>" What he never had put down his face to say, he will not regret again. This is the last chance, and he had to. Joran stayed silence for a moment. Just as he dropped his head, thinking Joran wouldn't forgive him,</p>
<p>"Maybe... if we meet again...?" He held out his knuckles to him for a promise. Lanz's eyes widened at the possibility, clenched his fist so tightly it's likely crushing his skin and flesh; gritted his teeth so hard it likely slice through his enamel. But he had to face the truth, play to his possibility, for this is his wish. To reborn in a new world where they can pursue what they please.</p>
<p>"Yeah..." Holding out his fist too, "And next time, we will win." And it clashed together. As they separated further and further, amidst Joran's smile, the annihilation happened far below, create a ball that looked like soap bubble that engulfed even the clouds. Even without solid material, the shock can be felt up in the Cloudkeep.</p>
<hr />
<p>Lanz, Noah, and Eunie gathered by the edge, peering for remnants. The Agnian three gave them time to reminisce the loss of someone dear. Riku, with tears in his eyes, was being cheered up by Manana.</p>
<p>Lanz remarked: "That was... Joran."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah. <em>Sure was. I swear, he hadn't changed one bit.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>But this... This... isn't OK. People shouldn't have to make such heartbreaking choices.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah... <strong>That's exactly why... we gotta move forward.</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie, looking up at the sky, "<em>Yeah, well...</em>" The wind jostling past them as they remembered someone they hadn't attend to.</p>
<hr />
<p>Nia was laying on her stasis pod. The group stood some distance watching her. The one hope they had before pursue was now lost. The direction that moved them forward now gone. Sena: "<em>What do we do...? The Queen's... She's gone now...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "What do we do? What can we even do...?"</p>
<p>Taion: "This was... supposed to be how we'd take back our world."</p>
<p>"Meh-meh..."</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, took the blame herself, "I'm so sorry... I <strong>knew</strong> I was half-Moebius... I should've been more careful, but instead..."</p>
<p>Noah was thinking in depth until something attracted his attention: "<em>Huh...</em>" Gasped.</p>
<p>"<strong>Ow ow ow ow...</strong>" That was the Queen climbing out from her 'coffin', effetely complaint, "<em>That bastard... Stuck me good, he did. Two cetris to the side and things'd've been a sight worse...</em>" The group was stunned, stuttering as they watched she revived from the hands of the dead, confused and awed.</p>
<p>Then, Nia gasped sharply as she realized she just lose her 'queen' composure in front of the group. This is not how a Queen should behave! With a deep breathe: "<strong>HUUUUUUUUHHHHH</strong>" Where's your manners! There's still room for changing their, "A-ahem!", second impression. "Oh, you must be..." And she gave the sour smile to try conceal her other part.</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>Impossible...! I saw it! I saw her being stabbed directly through the heart!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>And all that... blood everywhere!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>But now... Now she's alive! Alive and kicking!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Yeah!</strong>"</p>
<p>The first one that caught Nia's sight, the first that caught her attention, was Mio. "You are...?" And she stood on her legs, taking steps towards Mio closer to look at her, as if the stabbing was none of her business, "Oh, that's good... So it worked after all." Even her wounds are gone!</p>
<p>Mio: "Your... Majesty...?" And they nodded to each other.</p>
<p>Introducing to the others officially, "My name is Nia, and I am the Queen of Agnus... one wing of Aionios."</p>
<hr />
<p>No more diamonds on the right page; it's empty! No need anymore.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's Diary:</strong> N and M. Another version of us... What are we, really? Why do we exist in the first place? The answers are within me, together with her hopes and dreams. I will give them a voice. I will make him hear <strong>our</strong> truth...</p>

<p>Nia, standing by a balcony, peered at the distance. A giant semicircle-disc-shaped object that looked like motor lurked in the sky. Let's dismiss the weird-shape mountains and the cloud sea below. On the other side, Melia{{footnote: Queen of Kevesi, if you hadn't already know.}}, also on a balcony, looked at the other half of the disc structure.</p>
<hr />
<p>After Melia returned to her room, on a tiny screen on her table showed two planets, blue and red, attracted towards each other. They were so near that lightning formed in between their gaps. "300 days remain to the Intersection. It seems we might make it."</p>
<p>The screen now displayed Nia on video call. "Yes. It took every bit of our combined intellects... But we built it."</p>
<p>"To prepare for the time our two worlds collide..."</p>
<p>Nia was also in her room, chatting via a round mirror attached to her table, "All that we are is contained within. Memories, <em>and our souls</em>..."{{footnote: Snuff, their video quality is barely 240p.}}</p>
<p>"We will all be gone, <em>and then reborn</em>. Will it be a new beginning, or our demise...? No one can tell us that."</p>
<p>"Time will run its due course, and show us the true meaning... of our deed." And Melia nodded and cut the conversation.</p>
<hr />
<p>The day child Noah saw pigeon fluttered, as the clock struck 12, and the rolling of the giant red ball in the distance during the Queen's ceremony... The worlds are coming inevitable, and the Queens await their fates by their balcony. A bright light engulfed all.</p>
<hr />
<p>"In the distant past, what was once a single world was cleft in twain. Plus and minus... On the surface, they were identical. These two worlds, of opposing nature,... knew nothing of each other as they wended their way, towards their own respective futures. However, the worlds yearned for each other. Against the solitude of existence, they strove to reunite... though it would spell certain destruction. Should the two worlds intersect, they would cancel each other out and cease to be,{{footnote: Now we're talking matter and antimatter.}} leaving only light."</p>
<p>She continued, "Light... A shining beacon in the darkness. The last common language left to us. Though we inhabited separate worlds, the medium of light allowed us to communicate for the very first time, and so we sought for a way to prevent <em>total</em> oblivion... We pooled our knowledge, and through time, gave birth to a single point of hope..." It showed the engineering design (blueprint) of the giant circular disc.</p>
<p>"<strong>Origin.</strong> An ark, containing all the worlds' data, recorded in words of light, carrying hope into the future... Origin was a system we constructed to reboot the worlds' states. And then... the time was upon us."</p>
<p>"The reboot process failed to initiate. Instead, in that instant, the worlds became still, by the will of Moebius." Z standing in the middle, accompanied by X and Y. The red moon lurked in the background.</p>
<p>Noah concluded prematurely, "So it's their fault..."</p>
<p>"And at the heart of it, was their ringleader, Z. You could say Z embodies this frozen world."</p>
<p>Lanz don't understand, "But what does that achieve? Freezing everything?"</p>
<p>"Not a thing... He didn't need to do anything after that. Only... to keep everything in its place, in stasis, and create an eternity to abide within,... as was their wish." That's the killing between the two nations.</p>
<p>Noah: "He made our lives their sustenance..."</p>
<p>"Precisely so. In order to gain control of Origin, Z captured the Kevesi Queen." Showed Melia chained in an unknown location.</p>
<p>Mio: "To what end?"</p>
<p>"To access the memories in Origin, to bend them to his will. He needed a key, held only by its creators."</p>
<p>Eunie: "A key?"</p>
<p>"A heart... might be more fitting. Z used the key held by the Queen of Keves,... and seized Origin in its entirety. Controlling Origin... means controlling the world. And having shackled it, he can bend it to his will. Life and death... are his playthings." More and more moebius were created thereafter and joined the ranks.</p>
<p>Noah, looking at his term symbol, "Life and... <em>death...</em>"</p>
<p>While looking at Mio, "No one, not even M, knew the origins of this world." It made Mio breathed out with uneasiness, the statement.</p>
<p>Taion hypothesized, "So I guess... You have another key?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's in my possession. With its help, I was able to create... the Ouroboros Stones." To her left now emerged the previously undisplayed Ouroboros Stone, glowing incandescent green brightly. "Though most of the power is with Z, I have been able to... resist him, to a small extent." The Stone opened up and showed a triangle metal.</p>
<p>Sena observed it, questioned, "It's a... cogwheel?"</p>
<p>"One of the gears from Origin. Through a process of catalysis, between the Origin substrate and the Core in my chest, I can generate the Stones." A blue-pink diamond-shaped crystal located in Nia's chest.</p>
<p>Lanz: "And thanks to that, we became Ouroboros..."</p>
<p>"Yes, but... not completely."</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?" That power so immeasurable was still not its full form?</p>
<p>"Remember. Have you not succumbed to Moebius's power before?"</p>
<p>"Urgh..." X's staff that forced these two to cancel their Interlink.{{footnote: But, how does she know though? She can watch them while she's sleeping?}}</p>
<p>"As I've said before, Z commands the world's very fabric. Unfortunately, my own powers are sorely limited. And yet, you too can break Z's fetters, as you've shown, smashing through the rules he established. With your Ouroboros powers, and the Sword of the End, both."</p>
<p>Noah, looking at his blade, "The Sword... of the End?"</p>
<p>"The sword you hold. It is a byproduct of resonance... between the Kevesi Queen's heart, and Origin."</p>
<p>Taion: "Does that mean... it's like an Ouroboros Stone?"</p>
<p>"The Ouroboros Stones, and the sword... <em>They're mere gimmicks</em>. The crux of them <em>lies with you. You see, there are keys inside of you too</em>."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Inside of us..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Keys...?"</p>
<p>"Finally, my efforts were rewarded. I'm glad... To meet with all of you who embody hope..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Majesty, what is it that we must do?"</p>
<p>"Right. Infiltrate Origin, then free it, and the Kevesi Queen... from Z... From the hands of Moebius, once and for all."</p>
<p>Sena: "If we do free it, will we get to change the world? It's so cruel and senseless... <em>Can we undo that</em>?"</p>
<p>Nia looked down for a while, thinking about the philosophical question. Noah sensed her lack of confirmation. Sena: "<em>Your Majesty...?</em>"</p>
<p>After she gathered her words, "<strong><em>If you desire... to have a future before you...</em></strong>{{footnote: Damn, that doesn't even mean anything, Your Majesty!}}" Mio's eyes widened at the possibility.</p>
<p>Noah pressed on, "I need to know." Mio turned to him, whom continued, "Z and Moebius... Must they be our enemy?"</p>
<p>"Noah..."</p>
<p>"Now that... is something for <em>you</em> to decide. After confronting them, and discerning for yourselves what they truly are."</p>
<p>Noah thought for a moment before agreeing, "All right."</p>
<p>She nodded and urged, "Come this way." Then, she lead the way to the balcony.</p>
<hr />
<p>===</p>
<p>"Behold... There at the nadir of the vortex... sleeps Origin." In the distance was a tornado clouds that swirls.</p>
<p>"<strong>In the sea?!!!</strong>" Noah was shocked.</p>
<p>"Deep beneath the sea where none may tread, Z spins his world-spanning web."</p>
<p>Sena: "So you're saying... the Queen of Keves, she's there as well?" Agreed.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Well snuff me... I want to save the Queen as much as the next guy, but how are we supposed to even get there? You can't even get near, without being ripped apart." Ethel once mentioned some Ferronis tried to enter...</p>
<p>Eunie was optimistic "Yeah, but... If anyone were to know the trick, it's Queen Nia! Seeing as, y'know, she's the mastermind behind the whole Origin shebang, yeah?"</p>
<p>Nia summoned the innocent face therefore as the group have high hopes for her. Uneasily, she... "Uhhh.... Urgggghhh... Right... Actually, I... <em>kinda don't.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz released the most shocking and high pitch voice in the whole episode, "<strong>Abuh... But you're the Queen! How do you <em>not</em> know that?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie dropped her head, "This is shocking..."</p>
<p>Even Taion can't keep his rationality, "<strong>Absolute nonsense... I simply cannot believe this!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>I... I don't know how to respond...</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "C'mon, you lot. Rein it in now."</p>
<p>Now her voice struck something in Lanz: "Huh...? Hang on..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"Mio, don't you... get to use those Moebius powers?"</p>
<p>"Uh? U-uhm, well..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then it should be a snap, right? Peww! We're there. Those clowns were doing it all the time!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Actually..."</p>
<p>"Go on?"</p>
<p>"I can't... use them right now... The Moebius powers."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I noticed it... right after we liberated the Castle. I couldn't work out why myself, i-it was so sudden."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Noooo-! Is this why you blew us off saying to ask the Queen ourselves?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Uhhh... Sorry, Eunie..."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, love...</em>"</p>
<p>Nia: "I suspect, it must be Z."</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh?</strong>"</p>
<p>"The power of Moebius... It's part of the flow and fabric of the world. What is permitted, and what is prohibited, is subject to Z's whims. Even with Origin, not every Moebius knows of its existence."</p>
<p>"But I was able to use the Ouroboros powers..."</p>
<p>"The power you currently wield is, let's say, <em>external</em> to the flow. Even Z himself cannot grasp what's beyond his reach. Therein is <em>my hope based</em>."</p>
<p>"Hm..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "We're still stuck though. We know where to go, but we're kinda dead in the water here."</p>
<p>Noah, looking at the vortex, tried to think for alternative solutions, "<em>How to tackle the vortex, then...</em> Huh! Mr. Samon...!"</p>
<p>Mio tried recalling, "Mr. Samon was, uh... That Nopon from the City?"</p>
<p>"Yeah! Recall what he said? About a ship that could brave the Great Sea."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Ultimate... vessel?"</p>
<p>"That right. Even vortex in raging Great Sea not slow advance. It go down in history as Queen of boats! Still work in progress, but sure to bring to fruition someday. Is Samon's dream!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, he did say that! Something about it being able to take on stormy weather?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Wait, wasn't that a work in progress, though?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I think he might've been drawing up blueprints...?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Whatever Mr. Samon said, he was pretty ardent about it."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Which must mean..."</p>
<p>Sena: "There might be a way to get there, after all!"</p>
<p>Mio, looking at Noah in the eyes, excitedly, "<strong>All right, let's go!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Finally, our lucky break."</p>
<p>Sena: "Looks like this place was worth the trip!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Better hurry. I hardly imagine Moebius will stand idly by."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Agreed." And they just dashed off into the distance, leaving Queen Nia out of their short attention span.</p>
<p>After some run, Noah suddenly remembered, "<strong>Your Majesty</strong>!"</p>
<p>"Huh?" Her attention came back and saw Noah and Mio facing her from a distance.</p>
<p>"<strong>Thanks a lot! Things are looking up!</strong>" And he ran off first. Mio gave a smile, a neck-bow{{footnote: i.e. a nod.}}, before going after him.</p>
<p>After they leave, "Uh... sure..."</p>
<hr />

<p>Outside the Cloudkeep, the group gathered as Noah called for the request, and Travis answered, "Right, OK... I think I understand. If you're looking for Samon, he'll be in maintenance, same as usual. I'll send someone to get you. Just head on over."</p>
<p>"Many thanks. We'll be outside the Cloudkeep."</p>
<hr />
<p>The ship arrived, they boarded, and it zoomed off into the sky, towards the City.</p>
<hr />
<p>Upon arrival, they met Mr. Samon at his engineering department and explained the problem to him. "...Ahhh, friends mean old beaut? She tucked away, all cozy in Dock No. 3."</p>
<p>Lanz was surprised, "<strong>WHAT, REALLY?!</strong>"</p>
<p>He nodded, then said, "Curious?"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>We are!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Alrighty! Then, please follow Samon to port."</p>
<hr />
<p>Noah: "So, about this Dock No. 3."</p>
<p>Samon walked towards a small door only Nopons can pass through without crawling: "Ship is culmination of life ambition, so if anything happen, Samon die of heart fracture. That why she hidden sneaky-like."</p>
<p>After the door opened, the group were shocked. The small door actually turned into a large door: it was concealed as a wall! Sena: "Is that were you're keeping it...?"</p>
<p>"Dock No. 3, right this way, please. Samon take you."</p>
<hr />
<p>There was the new boat, the same color and shape as the previous given to them, but had extra (rocket-like) engines capable of giving it extra boost, capable of tearing through the vortex. The group watched in awe.</p>
<p>Mio: "So this is it? The ship that can conquer the Great Sea's vortex?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Suh-WEEETT{{footnote: 'Sweet' in a whistling tone}}! And you got it all ready, too!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's like a different beast from what we've been using..."</p>
<p>Taion: "I'd venture to call it a masterwork. There's a real sense of power behind this craft."</p>
<p>"Please not to get garments in twist. This is just hull."</p>
<p>All in unison: "<strong>Just the hull?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Key element of engine not quite ready yet. Ship without engine is like... It like Torpedo wrap without filling of Tasty Sausage!"</p>
<p>Manana: "<strong>That crime against cuisine! Torpedo wrap without Tasty Sausage like ship without engine!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "Mr. Samon, what is it the engine needs?"</p>
<p>He brought out something that looked like a needle with a center corkscrew, "To be precise, just need core component." Perhaps that's an activator, the thing that use to light up the piston? "Is this part here, and still need six more to make. Unfortunately, only have this one here."</p>
<p>Mio: "I've seen that metal before... It's the same as Noah's sword, right?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, looks like it."</p>
<p>Samon: "Also, it same as metal that go inside fancy eyepatches of Lost Numbers. Friends know eyepatches block Moebius tracking, surely?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, we heard that from Monica."</p>
<p>"That because eyepatch emit special wavelengths. This here show sources of such waves." He transmitted the information to their irises, to display blue dots all across Aionios, "Points of light on map indicate where metal can be located, but Samon could not visit. Every place is fearsome-scary.{{footnote: Fancy how he could track the metal's wavelength but the Moebius can't.}}"</p>
<p>Sena: "Can't you just use the metal from the eyepatches?"</p>
<p>"Those important equipment for Lost Numbers, so no-can-do. And even if could, metal is stretched into thin foil, making total amount not sufficient."</p>
<p>"<em>That's a shame...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Mio, look over here..." He focused on a targeted blue dot. It revealed...</p>
<p>"Yeah! The Cloudkeep. It's that thing that the Queen had!"</p>
<p>"Mr. Samon. So if we got you six more, you could complete the ship?"</p>
<p>"Naturally." The confidence he emitted was unwavering. "With that, can make ship with power and defense, that weather any storm or hole in sea."</p>
<p>"How long would it take to build?"</p>
<p>"Would give it three days, tops."</p>
<p>Eunie was amazed, "Wow, that's real snappy."</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>Good!</strong> As time is of the essence."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Awww-right. Let's crack on!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Yeah!</strong> Mr. Samon. Don't you worry. We'll get you your parts."</p>
<p>"Meh?" What is happening?</p>
<hr />
<p>As they were leaving, Samon called them back, "<strong>W-wait! Hold Ponios! Samon think Samon deserve some kind of explanation!</strong>" They were leaving him confused.</p>
<p>Noah: "Ahh, right. Here's the thing..."</p>
<p>After his explanation, "...Now Samon get it. So, friends want to use ship." He turned to looked at his beaut, nodded 2 times, then turned back to the group, "Well then, that only mean one thing!" He took out his computer ball, added, "To make friends' search for core parts easier, Samon must update data from previously."</p>
<p>Eunie don't understand, "How's that?"</p>
<p>"Data derived from obscure source could only show broad-strokes position. But now, Samon will make data more precise. Currently, can only constrain to area of about 2000 square metri. But with bit more elbow grease, should be able to increase accuracy to within 200 metri!"</p>
<p>Lanz can't estimate the scale, but a 10x reduction in area means "That's... good, right? This'll be a walk in the park then!"</p>
<p>"Indeedy-do!"</p>
<p>Taion: "It might take us less time than I'd anticipated."</p>
<p>Mio: "Right!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Mr. Samon, sir, you're sort of our hero right now!"</p>
<p>"So, friends currently have any ideas?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Definitely. We know who has the part in the Aetia region. We should go there now."</p>
<p>"Splendid! Then while friends itinerate, Samon will analyze remaining locations. Will send details when ready. Hope friends excited!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Mr. Samon."</p>
<p>Mio: "All right then, let's get going."</p>
<p>"Yeah. First stop, the Cloudkeep!" And Samon waved his wings to bade farewell.</p>
<hr />
<p>Entering the Cloudkeep, the Queen turned around and was surprised at their return. "<strong>Whuh? Why're you here again?</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>After the explanation, "<strong>WHAAAAAAATTTTT!!!???</strong>" How befuddled were they that she lost her manners and calmness. "Ah!... A-ahem... The gears of Origin... What fate, that they would be the ones to guide you..."</p>
<p>Noah explained, "Ouroboros and the Sword of the End have. They've brought us this far, so... I wouldn't be surprised."</p>
<p>"I understand. Well in that case, I will gladly concede it." And she took it away from the Ouroboros Stone and put it in Noah's hand.</p>
<p>Sena thought she was some sentient being, "You knew we'd be coming back though, right? It was all a part of your grand design, yeah? 'The future must be sculpted with one's own hands...' Something like that?" Yeah, God Nia. She looked at Nia, hoping she would agree with her hypothesis... There was a loooong pause.</p>
<p>"R-right, certainly." A white lie, huh... She wasn't confident herself, but couldn't put her down. "The future isn't something you can just be given. You do have to reach for it, with your own hands. Yes."</p>
<p>Noah took it out from his pocket again after he tucked it in his pocket, "Well, that's the first. Five left to go..."</p>
<p>Taion: "A promising start."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, could be worse! Keep going like this -- and job done!"</p>
<p>Noah agreed with him, "Thank you, Majesty. I promise you, we won't waste this gift." And they were ready to leave.</p>
<p>But she wasn't finished, "Wait a moment..." After they faced her, "How will you access Origin, even with the ship?"</p>
<p>"I-I mean..."</p>
<p>Sena excitedly announced, "We're gonna plunge into the Great Sea's vortex..."</p>
<p>"And after that? Origin is protected on every side by thick armor plating. You think you'll find a berth?"</p>
<p>Mio: "I guess, uh... maybe?"</p>
<p>Taion: "For starters, we don't even know Origin's general schematic. We're going in blind." The group now felt frustrated at the roadblock.</p>
<p>"Hmm... Take this." Looking at her core, it shone bright blue, and information were transferred to their Iris.</p>
<p>Noah: "Wh-what's this?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Is this... Origin?" In their iris displayed Origin's blueprints.</p>
<p>"A certain Nopon engineer was involved on the Agnian side of Origin's construction." She turned to look at the blast furnace in the room, reminiscing.{{footnote: Go, go, Poppi!}} "That's an early blueprint, left behind from those days. The Great Sea's vortex... is likely born from the force field emitted by this middle part, amplified by the structure built up around the circumference. That would be my best guess, anyway. As for the original purpose of the structure, it was a device to deploy a field to protect the facility while it generated an omni-static space. Consequently, this middle section here... It lacks the armored shell, making it Origin's only weak point." The blueprint showed a blue line conjoin to the outer shell, perhaps allowing an entrance? One don't know. Or maybe they can just enter from the middle part.</p>
<p>Mio: "Hmmmmm...."</p>
<p>Noah: "So then, basically, this is our entrance."</p>
<p>"Enter the vortex, and then using its flow, break through to the inside." Yeap, it's correct: a duct as an entrance to enter the middle part. "Once you are within, destroy the force field generator at the center. That's the trick."</p>
<p>"Yes I see..."</p>
<p>"However, the internal structure of Origin may well have been heavily modified by Z. <em>Even after you make it in, you must be on your guard</em>."</p>
<p>"Understood. We'll be fully prepared."</p>
<p>Lanz felt relieved, "Huh! You gotta hand it to the Queen, though. <strong>How could anyone</strong> know all that?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Shocking, I know!"</p>
<p>Even Taion was impressed, "<strong>Absolutely. I simply, cannot believe this!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio was feeling tired hearing their flattering praises, blandly asked, "C'mon, you lot, make your minds up already, will you?"</p>
<p>After they exit the door of the Queen's chambers, Mio: "By the way! After you met up with M, you were sleeping here all this time, right?"</p>
<p>Nia, whom accompanied them to the door, answered, "Yes."</p>
<p>"So then, how did you know we'd become Ouroboros? You seemed to know what had happened at the Castle as well..."</p>
<p>She turned around and looked at the blast furnace, explained, "Even as I sleep, I learn. Information on everything in this world collects right here."</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Thank you so much, for all this! I promise you, we will seize the future!</strong>" Now gone for good. The Queen watched them leave, then gave herself a 'yeah' dance. Her acting was successful again!</p>

<p>Wanted to know more about Nia? <a href="/92_nia.html">Check her out!</a></p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note:</strong> That extra member in a medium-sized Levnis is Segiri{{footnote: Segiri is the name given to her by Sena, because she doesn't have a name, only a number.}}, but that's not important in the story.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Outside by the beginning of the ladder leading up to Cloudkeep on the tip of the mountain, the group gathered and discuss their next step. Sena started first, "That's the first bit of Origin metal taken care of!"</p>
<p>Just then, Noah received "Oh, a call from Mr. Samon!"</p>
<p>The group joined the call, and here come Mr. Samon, "Meh-llo? Friends and first part now?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, just a moment ago. You've got good timing, man!"</p>
<p>"What friend saying? Samon placed call after see source of signal moving. Very evident proof of obtain."</p>
<p>"Oh... Well, uh, you know what I say to that? <strong>Meh!</strong>{{footnote: Something that caused Lanz to say Meh is real meh!}}"</p>
<p>Taion estimated the distance from the Cloudkeep, "His sensors could detect such a small displacement? Truly impressive..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Mr. Samon, I'm guessing since you called us..."</p>
<p>"Ah, yes! Have finished location data analysis... For only two places, however. In north of Aetia region, and east of Cadensia region. Those two signals, Samon could triangulate for more precision. Data just updated, so please to check."</p>
<p>"We got it. Thanks again, Mr. Samon."</p>
<p>"Not to worries. Please to keep up good work!"</p>
<p>After they hung the call, Mio summed up, "So, Aetia and Cadensia next, huh?"</p>
<p>Taion: "The one in Aetia is... Huh, in Everblight Plain...? And for Cadensia, data seems to be pointing to Cape Arcaphor in the Erythia Sea."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Right-o! Let's get on with it, loves."</p>
<hr />
<p>By a waterfall, Riku checked his terminal: "Oho! Location of treasure is seemingly behind waterfall!"</p>
<p>Mio: "That's unexpected..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Explains how it went undiscovered, at least."</p>
<p>Noah: "All right, let's go."</p>
<hr />
<p>Behind the waterfall was a cavern, and a GIANT piece of Origin metal (2x the size of Sena) stuck into the ground. Mio announced, "Got it!"{{footnote: Stupidly, that counts as "1" Origin metal, the same as the palm-size one the Queen gave to them. How much dilution is there?}}</p>
<p>Sena: "Together with the one we got from Her Majesty, that makes two."</p>
<p>Taion: "It's good luck that we found it so quickly. We can only hope the other pieces will come to us just as smoothly..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Let's track down the metal in Aetia."</p>
<p>Noah: "All right!"</p>
<hr />
<p>By the war-ridden land where we first met Noah, Eunie, and Lanz fighting in Chapter 1, Riku checked his terminal and announced, "Oho! Signal of Origin metal coming clear. Must be near now. This starting to feel like treasure hunt. Riku get kind of excited."</p>
<p>Lanz: "You know, you've got a point. It <strong>is</strong> kinda like one big world-hopping treasure-hunting adventure."{{footnote: To know how much time they traveled before from one region to other and Mio only got slightly more than a month left arriving at the City on the other side of Aionios, and now they can jump here and there in hours!}}</p>
<p>Eunie: "All right, calm down. Where's the signal, then?"</p>
<p>Tucking his terminal away, he looked at a direction, "It coming from over that way. If judge by distance reading, probably behind that ridge.{{footnote: That's a big rock that blocked their sight.}}"</p>
<p>Sena: "Hey Manana, race you for it!"</p>
<p>"OK, but Manana not give up easy!" And the two dashed off like two kids running for the end point, leaving the others in dust.</p>
<hr />
<p>Arriving at the location, similar huge chunk, but stuck deeper into the soil, Noah: "I guess this is it...?"</p>
<p>After retrieving, Lanz concluded, "That's the... uh... third one, right?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Half down, half to go."</p>
<p>Riku suddenly felt (perhaps vibration) in his terminal. Taking it out, he announced, "Meh? Oh, new data just arrive from Samon."</p>
<p>Noah, checking his Iris, "It looks like we're going to... the Pentelas region, and Fornis."</p>
<p>Mio triangulated, "This part of Pentelas... It's Maktha Wildwood, I think?"</p>
<p>Sena: "And as for Fornis, looks like Zain's Talon."</p>
<hr />
<p>Along a sandy desert where there was a ring buried in the sands, rainbow-colored mist floating in the area, Riku checked his terminal, "Hrumm... Very strange. Riku see reading of Origin metal, but not anything that could fit bill."</p>
<p>Taion: "The coordinate data does seem to be pointing us here."</p>
<p>Lanz: "That mean Mr. Samon's done goofed?"</p>
<p>Mio: "It doesn't seem very likely... Well, not <em>too</em> likely, at least..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Is it possible that it could be buried under the surface...?"</p>
<p>Eunie was intimidated by such possibility, "Oh, you've got to be joking. Please don't tell me we're gonna have to dig this whole place up."</p>
<p>Sena got the wrong message, "<strong>Dig the whole place up, got it!</strong>" Yeah, muscle girl!</p>
<p>"Queen's cuticles, I'm gonna hate this..."</p>
<hr />
<p>After 'culling the field', they finally found it. Sena: "Here it is!"</p>
<p>Taion: "That's the fourth one."</p>
<p>Riku: "Not long now."</p>
<p>Eunie: "So, Pentelas region next...?"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the bottom of Maktha Forest, a giant brog{{footnote: frog}} with long purple-ish ears, greenish body, and dark-gold claws stood in their way. "Riku check and double-check, but bad news is same. Signal come from that Rhana..."</p>
<p>Manana: "That mean Rhana ate it?"</p>
<p>Taion, scratching his head, "Based on the circumstances, that does seem to be the firmest hypothesis we have..."</p>
<p>Lanz was ready, "'Kay, well, let's just punch it in the gut and see what comes up!"</p>
<p>Eunie was yucked, "Blergh... Dibs, not me! Not touching it, no way no how." But the fighting was group work, don't need to touch it anyways, since you're using a rifle.</p>
<hr />
<p>After killing it, Lanz walked forward and did the dirty job, digging his hands into its stomach and searched through, until he felt some metal-ish object, pulled it out, "Origin metal, lovely jubbly."</p>
<p>Eunie: "...How can you handle that with a straight face?"</p>
<p>Lanz, handling out the metal to her, "You want a closer look?" That not only alerted her, even Riku and the others backed away.</p>
<p>"<strong>STOP IT! KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME, YOU CLOD!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Only one left to go." All checking their Iris, Mio announced, "We got some new data from Mr. Samon..."</p>
<p>Noah: "The final piece of Origin metal is waiting us in..."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>1,000 years ago.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The land scarred by battle. A Kevesi soldier walking up towards a Consul, accompanied by 2 other soldiers. More Kevesi soldiers lined up behind both sides of the alleyway. The 2 other soldiers gave the central soldier a gentle push, and he knelt both feet on the ground, looking sad. He had pointed chin, red iris, and scruffy hair, plain skin. As the Consul walked up towards him, the other soldiers turned around and returned to their post.</p>
<p>"Congratulations! You're special. Precious few make it all the way to their Homecoming." Then, the Consul summoned a Kevesi blade, pointing it at the guy. The guys eyes widened by such act. Perhaps he was shocked, surprised; perhaps he already knew his fate, seeing others suffered the same when he was younger. "But... this won't do at all. Your lives shine all the brighter... if they're extinguished right here on the battlefield." And he dropped his head in dismay.</p>
<p>Someone suddenly walked in between the guy and the Consul, blocking the Consul's view "Mm?... What's the meaning of this, Commander Crys?"</p>
<p>"I bid you sheathe your Blade, my Lord Consul."</p>
<p>"Come again? You want to take his shine for yourself?" How dare you defy the order of a Consul, you worthless puppet that should not have your own thoughts!</p>
<p>"I am simply stating there's no need. Why kill him now?"</p>
<p>"Hm?" The Consul took a small step back, asking him to speak more.</p>
<p>"His time is at an end... How brightly he shone, he himself knows better than anyone. Your actions will not make him brighter, I'm sure."</p>
<p>"<strong>M-Mutiny...?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Why not just let it go, V?" He turned to his right (and Crys' left) and saw M appeared silently.</p>
<p>"<strong>M...? Why are you here?</strong>"</p>
<p>"When their appointed hour arrives, should we not grant them an appropriate departure?"</p>
<p>"<strong>DON'T BE A FOOL!!! Then their life...arg urg... will be lost from circulation, will it not?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Crys: "Oh!" So that's the reason.</p>
<p>"Z also wishes it so."</p>
<p>"<strong>Z does? I refuse to believe it!</strong>" And M just looked at him in his eyes, insistent that he let it go. And he, weaker than M, could only abide, "<strong>V-very well...</strong> Do as you see fit, then." And he walked away therefore, back to his original position, with M watching him.</p>
<p>Crys turned around and face the soldier for a moment before turning to M, asking for permission, "If I may? Let me send him on..." And she nodded.</p>
<p>With a thin smile, the soldier also agreed him accompanying his final moments. Bringing out his flute, he played the melody, and the guy closed his eyes, immediately evaporated into golden motes. The other soldiers watched as he rose into the air. V put out his hand, regretful of the loss, perhaps another cup of lives lost from enjoyment, but could only put down his hand as there's nothing he could do right now. The others watched quietly as the golden motes rose and dissipated into the sky up ahead.</p>
<p>Day after day, night after night, the day passed untracked. Crys, forever playing his melody, forever on his way to play his melody, forever sending off those that needs be. How many had he sent on, he could no longer count. A thousand years passed, and we arrived at one of the occasion{{footnote: morning time}}. As he tucked his flute back into his pocket, Noah praised,</p>
<p>"That's a good tune. A Crys original?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I suppose it is."</p>
<p>"Maybe I'll pinch it as well."</p>
<p>"You've got your own tunes, Noah. Those are... just as good. Wonderful, I'd say..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Really?</strong> I only... tweaked a few notes in a score from my previous Colony..."</p>
<p>"<em>It's not the notes that matter... It's the feelings you imbue them with.</em>"</p>
<p>"Feelings?" He couldn't yet understand what he meant, but he nodded back, perhaps believe that, one day, he'll come to understand it.</p>
<p>"Raw emotion... It resonates." And he looked up at the blue sky with some cumulus clouds, and Noah followed glance.</p>
<hr />
<p>That scene was played out in the movie theater, with the sound of tape playing in the background. Then, whiteout the screen, blinking as it came to an end. One of the Moebius watched, before the projector shut off and the lights that reflected onto his/her mask dimmed, leaving only his/her eyes glowing in the dark.</p>
<p>All form of noise like a thousand ghosts trying to escape a central entity, their wish not satisfied and hence unwilling to leave the living realm just yet. In Z it originates. As he spoke, the noise continued rambling in the background. "O <em>all ye formless dead</em>... Will you respond <em>to the Queen's awakening</em>?"</p>
<p>A light came online and shone directly on N, still depressed in his meditative form, unable to get out from his lost of M. Z looked at him for a few moments before continuing, "The Sword of the End..." And he recalled Noah's Ouroboros pulling it out from his core; the immeasurable power it wields that illuminates even the darkest of the night. And he recalled how Origin, from far above the sky, came crashing down the mountains and pillars among a dusty region.</p>
<p>"Of all the vestiges of Origin, strewn through the world, who knew this fragment <em>yet remained</em>?" The shockwave Origin sent as it cruised through the air, pushing it sidewards like the booming sound a jet blasted through that could be seen with naked eyes. Upon contact, an immeasurable heat was immediately generated and released, sending bright light like that of a bomb blasting, and fire clouds engulfed and destroyed all structures in its vicinity, sending smoke to the further vicinity.</p>
<p>"It is no longer one with the flow. We have no means of controlling it." The Moebius that was in the theater earlier spoke. Crys' melody played as he spoke.</p>
<p>Z therefore asked, "Will you go, then?"</p>
<p>"No... There's no need, is there?" He removed his helmet and revealed himself -- Crys. Moebius C, probably. "He will come to me. I know it. To share with me his feelings..."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the location where they'd just found the penultimate piece{{footnote: Because you can choose where you search the penultimate piece, this location changes dynamically.}}, Noah was examining the location of the final piece. A central circular disc with some thin rod connecting to one side. "Is it here?" He brought up a blue dot that signifies at one of the central of the thin rod.</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's not inside the Castle. <em>O...K...</em>" She therefore sighed, relieved. And she continued to think where that is, "<em>So that puts it at...</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>GARDIN DEFENSE BASE?!!!</strong>" Shout both Lanz and Eunie, and they looked at each other overreacting.</p>
<p>Sena, never heard of that name, was wondering why they were so 'excited', "Gardin... <strong>what now?</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah explained to the former Agnians, "It's a guard outpost at the Castle rear. They bring new recruits there too, for basic training."</p>
<p>"Well, phew!" Sena don't understand why that sounds difficult. "You had me worried there for a second. Thought we'd be back in the Antol's{{footnote: An insect-like enemy.}} jaws..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Even so, it's an enemy base. We can't expect to just waltz in without a fight." Noah agreed with him, and laid out his tactic,</p>
<p>"First, let's just try to scope it out."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group arrived at the bridge leading to the Castle. At the end of the bridge was a closed door. No soldiers seen guarding the post, but neither could they pass from the locked front entrance. As they slowly walked towards it, Sena: "So, it's beyond this bridge...?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah..." Stopping and looking at it, he continued, "No chance from the front, not like this."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Noah scanned toward the left. There was a few floating island, and at the edge of their current island, there's a machinery for them to slide to the next island. "We can go across those islands. That way... we should be able to swing round the back. Then... it's in and out, fast as we can."</p>
<p>Eunie optimistically agreed, "Yeah. We go in, we get the shard, and we hightail it outta there."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>Mio: "I can't see another way... Let's do it." And she led the way while the rest followed. Noah left himself behind, looking attentively at the door at the end of the bridge, his mind wandered to unknown dimension. As he looked up at the Castle, his mind wandered even more. What is he eager to meet there? Or <em>who</em> is he waiting for? Who is waiting for him? Will the friends from the depth of memories reappears?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a battlefield, the cliché exchanges of fires and blades. Far back, Noah and Crys watched without joining in. And Crys turned around and said something to him, and his eyes widened, thrust himself forward, as Crys did something unexpectable.{{footnote: Unknown to us what it is.}}</p>
<p>Later, on some metal ground, perhaps in his barracks, Noah looked at the black flute that lies on the ground, or is it his bed?, thinking in his head, "<em>Crys... You were a week away from your Homecoming... Why?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Huh..." O the heavy rock that weigh down your heart; shall it bring you back memories in the worst of time. You who don't have time to think about it in the first visit, occupied your mind with the annihilator; now the shackles had been released and the depth of your memories now returned.</p>
<p>"Noah? You OK?" Mio had stayed back, noticing his lagging behind. Taion and Eunie turned around to check his status.</p>
<p>"Hrnggg uh... Oh, yeah. Sorry about that." He therefore shook his head, to try to rock it out from occupying his attention.</p>
<p>"Hmm?" The other two, noticing his OK, had already continued their pathway. Mio wondered more, but still continued thereafter, leaving him to have had a final watch at the Castle before joining. Even he felt "<em>Strange... Now of all times?</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>The black fog that never dissipates clouded the area where containers and buildings installed themselves. The group had already snitched in, walking like gangsters occupying the central alleyway. The day was slightly dark, and street lights illuminates the vicinity yellow-orange. Nobody noticed them, because there's nobody. As they arrived at the second door leading up the Castle, Noah turned around, and the others followed, looking at the path they had just walked. It's... too quiet. A forest without birds chirping and insect calling for mates is the highest level of emergency -- something is lurking out there that scared these fragile small ones from revealing their existence.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>This is unsettling.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Not a single person anywhere in sight.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "What's goin' on? Is this... 'cause we busted up the Annihilator?"{{footnote: Bro, how long that is already? You think the effect can last till now?}}</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>No, I very much doubt it.</em> We didn't do any direct damage to the Castle itself."</p>
<p>Sena hypothesized, "Maybe it's because of the machiney Queeny?"</p>
<p>"Even so, we didn't actually free the soldiers here, right? <em>And yet no one's here.</em>" He checked his iris and scanned the surrounding to gather more data. The blue dot that revealed the location of the shard now inside the Castle. "Huh? <strong>The shard's changing position! Hey, Noah! Look at this!</strong>{{footnote: This isn't shouted out, just higher tone.}}" Nope, he was looking at the Castle attentively, lost in his mind. "Noah?"</p>
<p>"It's a song." He had already heard it, amidst the background, the silent melody that played too easily filtered by the mind, esp. when he was speaking out louder than the song.</p>
<p>"What song?"</p>
<p>The other off-seer can hear, "You're right. It's a Kevesi one. The melody..."</p>
<p>"Yeah. And it's not just any melody. I know who's playing."</p>
<p>Mio dropped his head and recalled what she saw when they interlinked, or perhaps at the white smoke space after M's execution, where Crys stood at the top of the stage during their first Homecoming day, whom occupied his central attention the whole ceremony. "Crys..." And Noah turned and acknowledged.</p>
<p>Before he could acknowledge, "Wait, Crys...? Wasn't that the guy who was Noah's off-seeing instructor?" Eunie heard of him before.</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> But, Crys is..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah. He died. Four years ago."</p>
<p>Taion: "Does that mean... he's been reborn, like Ethel?"</p>
<p>"No... <em>I don't think that's it.</em>" And he drew out Lucky Sevel unsheathed; it oscillates strongly.</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>What then... like, Moebius?</em>" After all, Joran was one, so it wasn't that shocking anymore to discover another.</p>
<p>"Hfffff...."</p>
<p>Mio shared, "There are two types of Moebius. The kind like Z and X... who were Moebius from the beginning... and humans... who became Moebius... like N, M, and Joran."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh...."</p>
<p>Sena: "S-so..." And Mio nodded to her. "Is this like, <em>a trap?</em>"</p>
<p>"Probably. But the Origin metal readout is real. It's definitely here." The sword oscillates so strongly it shone!{{footnote: Actually, it's the streetlight that shone on it, reflected from it, that caused it to shine; but hey, isn't it more awesome to hear that oscillation creates energy and making it shine? }}</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>In we go?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah.</em> In we go."</p>
<p>"<strong>Wha-? Into the jaws?!</strong>" Eunie can't believe such decision making.</p>
<p>Noah had already taken down his eyepatches. "They're clearly aware that we're coming. But there's no one around. <em>He's waiting. For me...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Walking along the corridor inside the Castle. The blood red sky filled the chamber behind them. The others also took off their eyepatches; there's no need anymore. Then, the elated voice of Crys echoed, "Good to see you again, Noah."</p>
<p>"<em>I knew it. Crys.</em>"</p>
<p>"Thank goodness. I'm so happy to see that you're still an off-seer."</p>
<p>"<strong>Crys! Come out! Reveal yourself!</strong>" The others were looking up to find the source of the voice, scanning; but nobody's there, only his voice.</p>
<p>"I'm waiting in the throne room. Take your time. I want you to come up here. Then I want you to play... that <em>special melody</em>." In front of them were the stairs that lead up to the elevator that lead up to the throne room.</p>
<p>"<strong>CRYS!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'll be waiting."</p>
<hr />
<p>"I first met Crys... on the day of a Homecoming." It was the first Homecoming they attended. Even before knowing him personally, he already fixated his eye on Crys.</p>
<p>Lanz: "I remember..." Same as Eunie. They were now standing in front of the elevator. But they were not ascending until they heard Noah's story.</p>
<p>"A short time later, I put in to become an off-seer. And then... we met again."</p>
<h5 id="start-of-noahs-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#start-of-noahs-memories-1">Start of Noah's Memories 1</a></h5>
<p>Noah stood in front of a wall with deep carvings that looks like a bird, like a whale, like a creature fighting another creature, or was it just random?{{footnote: OK, it looks like Bionis fighting Mechonis, if you watched Xenoblade 1 before.}} Then, Crys approached from behind. They were inside the Castle, at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the elevator to the throne room.</p>
<p>"The name's Noah, right?" He turned around and faced him, whom introduced himself, "I'm Crys. Starting today, I'll be your personal tutor. All right? Let's begin."</p>
<p>He wasn't replying, looked at him emotionless. Then, he looked down and saw the black flute he held out, handing him. His lips grew a faint smile as he looked back into Crys' golden iris, and he nodded. He therefore nodded back and grabbed the flute from him.</p>
<hr />
<p>By an evening sky along fluffy brown grass that swayed with the wind, Crys was playing the melody, Noah listening.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another night inside the barracks, Crys holding on to his flute and Noah his, teaching him how to take care of his flute, wiping it with a piece of cloth.</p>
<hr />
<p>Another evening outside their camp area, Crys teaching him to learn by ear.</p>
<p>And after that, they had bread and pasta and tea, probably, for dinner. Noah took his bite first with Crys watching.</p>
<hr />
<p>By the grass again, Noah's now the one playing, with Crys supervising.</p>
<hr />
<p>The morning blue sky turned into an evening red. Approximately the same location; this time, by some waterfall and a pool. The grown up Noah and Crys standing side by side. He asked, "Hey, Crys? Tell me something. Back then on that day, why did you look so sad?"</p>
<p>"Which day?"</p>
<p>"The day of Homecoming. In Colony 14."</p>
<p>"Ahhhh... I see. So that's how I looked to you then." And he nodded, speaking of his observations,</p>
<p>"The others looked so happy. And the soldier, <strong>he was so pleased about it.</strong> But not you."</p>
<p>"I think... he probably felt content."</p>
<p>"<em>Content?</em>"</p>
<p>"He had lived through it all. Fought hard. And in serving his Colony, he found purpose." Noah waited for him to speak more. "<em>I find... it's quite a tragic thing.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>But why?</strong> I mean, it was time for him to return Home."</p>
<p>"What do you think that entails?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Reaching your life's expiry date? Surviving through so many battle?"</p>
<p>"Well, I..."</p>
<p>"<em>Do you honestly believe...</em> he was happy to disappear for such trivial reasons? That his smile belied no doubt? <em>To me, he looked ready to cry.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Being unable to choose his end, merely accepting what comes next.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Crys..."</p>
<p>"There's no joy in a contrived death, Noah."</p>
<h5 id="end-of-noahs-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-noahs-memories-1">End of Noah's Memories 1</a></h5>
<p>"<em>Contrived death, huh.</em>" It makes Eunie thinking. "<em>At this point, I get him. Kind of, at least.</em>"</p>
<p>"On that day... <em>he shook my belief.</em> <strong>Was I really content?</strong> Content with the path I'd chosen to follow?"</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio can felt him, him who always thinking about his path, day by day, night by night.</p>
<p>"<em>And then he chose for himself.</em> His end... would be by his design. <strong>I need to know.</strong> What was he thinking back then?{{footnote: Can he really recall without his memory cheating on him? We don't know.}} <strong>And why now? Why has he appeared before me?</strong>" So he turned around and went up the elevator therefore.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the throne room, Crys stood beside the mechanical Queen in front of the throne. Noah first dashed up, the others following behind; he stopped once he saw the person he'd been waiting for ages. "<em>Crys...</em>"</p>
<p>The Queen first spoke behind her mask, "Ouroboros. You dare to appear before me once again. Do you not value your lives? <em>Such idiocy</em>. You should never have shown <em>your faces here again</em>. But you leave me no choice. For sullying <em>this consecrated</em> ground, <em>I will see to it...</em> that justice is served!" And she immediately summoned 3 fireballs in mid-air.</p>
<p>The group summoned their blades to defend themselves, naturally, while awaiting her to gather enough forces before the release. Crys did nothing while it gathered for a while, until he started speaking few moments later, "What a terrible din." And he just raised his left hand, aimed it at the Queen's head, and blasted her off. She fell to the ground, unmasked once again, and black smoke rose from her mechanical head, awaiting another repair.</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah was shocked by what he did. Isn't she his ally?</p>
<p>"Only an imitation. Its empty words could never ring true. Let me hear it... Noah. I want... a true melody." He walked himself into the middle of the stage to face them. He recalled his blade, one like Lanz but its fatness unbelievable.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway through the battle, Noah sheathed his blade, shouting, "<strong>Why, Crys? Why become Moebius?</strong> Tell me... What would possess you to side with them?"</p>
<p>"So I could see you again... Noah." They had already sheathed their blades, seeing the battle not going to continue.</p>
<p>"<strong>But why?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Your sworn mission is to change this world, is it not?"</p>
<p>He fire-rapidly replied, "Yes."</p>
<p>"And is that because you're unhappy with the way it is?"</p>
<p>"It's wrong, and we have to correct it. That is all."</p>
<p>"I see... So relentless desire... is what drives you."</p>
<p>"<em>Desire?</em>"</p>
<p>"You fight for <em>betterment.</em> For ever greater aspirations."</p>
<p>"And what's wrong with that?"</p>
<p>Slightly shaking his head, "Nothing at all. It's human nature, after all. But you still don't understand. There's something you must learn."</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"To be content... with one's lot."</p>
<p>"<em>What do you mean?</em>"</p>
<p>"Don't you see? Only the strong can ever hope to reach the fabled horizon that you seek. Your words must be backed up by strength in <strong>equal</strong> measure. Winners' logic." That immediately brought him back to what Joran had said,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<em>But birds...</em> <strong>What can they possibly know of how a lowly worm feels?!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Crys continued, "Then... what would you have become of the weak? Would you abandon them? You would refute their everything? End their story there?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Moebius are the ones doing that!</strong>"</p>
<p>He closed his eyes, "Noah... What you're trying to achieve here amounts to the same thing. You really think freeing Origin will revive the world and solve all our problems? You must surely have heard from the Queen of Agnus. The truth of this world." The collision. The engulfment.</p>
<p>Sena didn't get the storyline, "So what then? You're saying the Queen's lying?"</p>
<p>"No... Surely not."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then what?</strong>"</p>
<p>"But there is no guarantee."</p>
<p>"Huh..." The answer that she had avoided so far, distracted herself from thinking about such possibility. It would render their actions so long useless; it would pull up their anchor!</p>
<p>"<strong>If... If the Queen is wrong,</strong> and the world is not created anew... what happens then?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"What if this is some flight of fancy? <strong>What if you've been taken in, staking your lives, on a whim? Who's accountable?</strong> I ask you that."</p>
<p>"Um... Well, I..."</p>
<p>Noah took over as she stuttered, "<em>I think...</em> it's still the right thing to do."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>"It was your smile... Crys." That day when he ended his life. "<em>I get it now.</em> I know why you were smiling back then. 'I'm good here.' I get what you meant now. You asked me once... if I would keep moving. <em>And my answer...</em>"</p>
<p>"Tell me, Noah."</p>
<p>Unwaveringly, "I will. To the end. So that I can <strong>treasure</strong> those <em>final moments...</em>"</p>
<p>"Final..."</p>
<p>"When that hour is upon me... I want to look back and smile..." M's smile, Joran's smile, Crys's smile. "Then I'll be... 'good'." Crys sterned his eyebrow a little. "And to come out smiling... we all have to choose where our lives take us. For our future selves... And yet... lack of choice is enough to break a person." The final cries of Ethel and Cammuravi, the out-of-mind elation of Joran, the dissatisfaction of Shania, M's thought on jumping off a cliff, N's emotionless face when he killed the people of the City finally, "They struggle, suffer... clawing their way through endless fog. <strong>A world without choice...</strong> That's wrong. <em>If death is a lie in this world, it deserves to end.</em>"</p>
<p>"So you'd rather perish along with the world."</p>
<p>"<em>I just...</em> I just want to cut this world free from Moebius."</p>
<p>"Whatever the consequences?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Otherwise... the Queen would never have told us the things she did. We take everything as it comes. And we're <em>afforded so little.</em> Still..." And he clenched both palm into fist, looking at the floor, "No matter how slim a chance we might have, it's a chance. <strong>So if that's an option we can take... Then I'll take it!</strong>" As his head raised, he no longer wavers.</p>
<p>And Crys put up a smile on his face, "<strong>Noah. Your melody... I hear it loud and clear. Now show it to me. YOUR CONVICTION... AND YOUR SMILE!!!</strong>" And the throne started transforming as he finished his words, changing into a mecha robot we'd seen before in Agnus Castle's floating throne. Then Crys teleported onto the mecha robot{{footnote: There's a one-man size balcony in front of it.}} and overlook the battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>The giant mecha robot detached and crash to the ground. Electric sparkles at its joint. Crys held on to the balcony's handle tight as it impacted the ground. Noah, seeing him not in good shape, quickly sheathed his blade and ran up to him, dragging him out of the balcony and laid him down, back on the robot.</p>
<p>After he managed to relax a bit, he opened his eyes softly and looked at Noah's, softly speaking, "<em>It's... a beautiful song... Noah.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hngggggh</em>" He snuffed his tears.</p>
<p>"Noah... The one who made me Moebius... was Z."</p>
<p>"<em>Haaaaarghh</em>"</p>
<p>"And it wasn't just me. J too. And N... and M... All of us were human once, and Z changed our very being."</p>
<p>"Why? <strong>Why would he do that</strong> to you?"</p>
<p>"<em>For that... you'd be best off asking Z himself...</em> <strong>But listen...</strong> <em>Noah... I think in the end, I was happy... to have become Moebius... How could I not be... after hearing such a wonderful song.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Crys...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Moebius are... an entity bound by the confines of this world. Strong... yet somehow fragile... And in their fragility{{footnote: Talk about <em>antifragile</em>.}}... they crave only the 'now', fearing to tread even a single step towards the future...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hah...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I chose... the path of the off-seer... because I had a thought.</em>" He thought about the mecha-Queen waving her hands up as if to embrace. The guy whom reached his expiry date at Noah's first Homecoming disappeared into golden motes therefore. "<em>The sender, and the ones being sent... I wanted to learn exactly what it was... that connected them.</em>"</p>
<p>The rest of the group, still standing far from the two, listened in the background as they spoke, feeling touched themselves.</p>
<p>Crys continued, "<em>Though we may be forgotten... our feelings live on. It is through our melodies that we carry them on. I think... I once told you something... to that effect?</em>"</p>
<p>And he nodded in remembrance, "Yeah."</p>
<p>"<em>There's a place doing just that: The City.</em>"</p>
<p>"The City is?" He didn't know that, even though he'd visited it already. What's Crys's point of view?</p>
<p>"<em>The many lives born of the City... Lives, whose existence was never recorded in Origin...</em>" Noah recalled when they saw the new baby for the first time being born in the maternity ward. "<em>They are our future. They themselves are proof of the coming winds of change.</em>"</p>
<p>"I think... I see..."</p>
<p>And he gently nodded. He tried to draw more breathe, and while still spoke softly, spoke louder softly, but he's clearly losing Qi, "<em><strong>They</strong> are... <strong>our hope. Just as you once were, they too are the product of Ouroboros's will</strong>.</em>{{footnote: soft staccato voice for those bold italics.}}"  And he scanned the rest of the group. "<em><strong>And that...</strong> is something that can never die.</em>"</p>
<p>"Crys... You knew everything all along..."</p>
<p>"<em>Haaaaaaaaaaaaa</em>..." And he relaxed his muscles and rested his head down on the mecha robot's body, looking up as if he saw the sky that was awaiting his return. "<strong><em>Noah... One last thing.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>And he already knew what it was that he wanted. He stood up, took the flute from his pocket, held it in his hands. After looking at Crys for one last moment, to which Crys nodded back to him, he carefully placed the flute to his lips, and started to play Crys's melody.</p>
<p>Lanz closed his eyes to enjoy the melody. Eunie watched with teary eyes at the heartbreaking scene. Even Taion can't resist shedding tears. Nor do Riku and Manana.</p>
<p>Crys closed his eyes as he heard the melody to send him on. He whom had send others on, now it's his turn to be sent on. He recalled his moments with Noah for the current life Noah's living, the bits and pieces that they shared were among the happiest; someone whom had heritage his legacy except his voice, for which Noah had found his. One first need to know how to play, only then one can think philosophically. For if one don't, one'll be too burdened by the playing that used up too much mental energy from thinking what life is.</p>
<p>Sena turned to Mio, asked, "Aren't you gonna...?"</p>
<p>She turned to her and shook her head. She knew what he wants; it's not a shared feeling; it's <em>his</em> feelings towards him. And so he would have it all. As blue cyan light started glowing on Crys's body nearing the end of the melody, motes started to rise thereafter, Crys gave his last words, "<em>You really... do play the most beautiful tune...</em>" Noah played with his eyes closed, but muscle contracted as he heard Crys's words, "<em>Go now, Noah... Sing your song... for all to hear...</em>" As tears gathered at the tip of his eyes, Crys finally gone for good. He opened his eyes just in time to see him gone.</p>
<p>The motes shot up into the sky; globules of motes spiraled up among individuals. He put down the flutes and looked up; another friend gone, no more being reborn, at least not before time starts again.</p>
<hr />
<p>As they walked out of the Castle, they were quiet, giving Noah time to settle his feelings. Other soldiers previously fainted already woken up from their dreams, still feeling drowsy from forced asleep, shaking their head as they walked out of the quarters lining the defense base. Noah stopped and turned around to have a last look at the Castle. The throne room at the top of the segment, very near the sky, near to heaven. And his eyes widened. The rain dripped from the sky, as if crying at the loss of a loved ones.{{footnote: Only in the no-subtitle video.}}</p>
<p>Mio watched his reaction turned a little brighter and let out a sigh of relief, "Huh..." She then turned to look at where he's looking.</p>
<p>Lanz looked the same direction, but turned around to ask, "Noah..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"So those things Crys said... What was that all about?"</p>
<p>"Finding value."</p>
<p>"What now?"</p>
<p>He turned around and looked at the soldiers that occupied the roads, some speaking, some traversing. "Crys... When he played his off-seer song, he conveyed his wish to me. His wish... that I would come to find value, in all things."</p>
<p>Taion: "He entrusted it all to you, Noah. Ergo... The rest is history."</p>
<p>"Yeah... <em>But it's so</em>..."</p>
<p>Mio voiced out his thought, "Sad, isn't it?" And he nodded. Can't use a more descriptive word, but it works out all right.</p>
<p>He therefore made up his mind. "<strong>I'm going. For sure.</strong> His wishes won't be in vain as we march... on Origin."</p>
<hr />
<p>Origin.</p>
<p>The black fog so thick in the Castle cannot prevent Z from looking at the group's current situation on the cinema screen. The thousands of undead soul still whispering, captured inside his body. "Do you truly want it thus, o ye voices? <strong>Then let me</strong> enunciate, <strong>emphatically</strong> so, <strong>the rules</strong> to which this world adheres, <strong>for the benefit of us all</strong>."</p>

<p>{{footnote: This is the prelude. Feel free to skip to the next section.}}</p>
<p>Sitting by Erythia sea, Noah commented, "It's soothing. The sound of the waves..." The beach they sat on were so white it reflected light blue of the sea and sky.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Just look at it... The sea just seems to go on forever."</p>
<p>Sena: "If we were still in Colony Gamma, we'd never have ended up coming here."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Don't think we would've either, eh, Noah?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, no way... I don't think I could've even imagined spending time just gazing out on the water."</p>
<p>Taion logically rebutted, "Well, of course not. If we had the time to spend staring at the sea, we had time to fight."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You said it."</p>
<p>Mio expressed, "I think having moments like these is good for us, from time to time."</p>
<p>Taion: "Agreed..." Then: "I'm getting a call... Huh?! It's Commander Isurd..."</p>
<p>Isurd, over the line, asked, "Taion. Can I bother you?"</p>
<p>"Of course, Commander! What can I do for you?"</p>
<p>"I need to discuss something with you. Could you come by Colony Lambda? That is, when you have a free moment. I would hate to inconvenience you."</p>
<p>"Yes, understood. We'll be there."</p>
<p>"All right, see you later then, Taion."</p>
<p>After he hung up the call, Eunie questioned, "What'd he say?"</p>
<p>"That we should meet him at Lambda whenever we have time..."</p>
<p>Noah: "All right. Then let's pay him a visit when we next have a gap in our schedule."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group approached Colony Lambda, with Mio in the lead. Before she entered some tent, something clicked on her head. Turning to Taion, "Oh, now I remember. Taion, you got that message from Isurd, right?"</p>
<p>"I did. I was thinking now might be a good time to see him."</p>
<p>Noah: "I'm sure you'll have a lot to talk about. We'll be waiting outside."</p>
<p>"Thank you. I'll try to make it quick." And he made a dash into the Commander's tent.</p>
<hr />
<p>Taion was looking at a cubic object on his hand. The outer cube was consisted of light gray and dark gray, then inside the cube, another cube arranged so that its tip were on the middle of each side of the outer cube, purple. Repeat it two more times, with the next the tip slightly protruding outside the side so it's larger than fitting the 2nd purple cube. Inside the fourth was a dark golden circular object. "What's this?"</p>
<p>"This was Nimue's. A lens. A membrane, covering an Iris."</p>
<p>"Nimue... <em>used this</em>?"</p>
<p>"Yeah." And it brought him back to past memories.</p>
<h5 id="start-of-isurds-past-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#start-of-isurds-past-memories-1">Start of Isurd's Past Memories 1</a></h5>
<blockquote>
<p>It must have been five years ago. It was... on an expedition to the Cadensia frontier.{{footnote: Anything in this brackets are words spoken in the present. Applicable only to this page.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Blizzard blew so hard at a place where Agnian levnises and soldiers were suffering attacks. Kevesi troops marched forward as they attack, felling Agnian soldiers on their way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>However, Kevesi troops attacked at night. My squad was crushed. And I was hurt, bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The soldiers and Levnises left behind to gain time for the Commander to escape. He was struggling through the blizzard towards safety. But he didn't walked for long before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>A short moment and Nimue{{footnote: In her grown up form.}} found him, picked him up, putting him behind her back, and dragged him along toward her hideout, while the hard-blowing blizzard were shrouding the view of the Kevesi troops.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The one who nursed me back to health, was Nimue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Inside a barrack, where Nimue sat beside the fainted Isurd. There were no one else in the barrack lined with beds on two sides of the central alleyway.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Theirs was a curious colony. No one ever fought. They'd spend their days tending Saffronias.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As he could walk, he saw how other Agnians were sowing fields and planting seeds. The bright pink and red Saffronias bloomed so huge it engulfed one part of the island.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There used to be a Castle there at one time, but... at some point, it was destroyed in a great battle, and there it lay in ruins.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the lake inside their colony was some sunk debris, with its remnants sticking out of the waters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It was there, that I saw some cradles, left over from that time.{{footnote: So, some cradles that were outside the Castles' controls, and each pod assigned specifically to a particular person will always get reborn at the same pod when they die.}} They looked like they would break at any minute, but still, <em>some were making soldiers</em>. Nimue... she was just... one of them. The people there... they were like we are now. They lived free of the Flame Clock's yoke.</p>
</blockquote>
<h5 id="end-of-isurds-past-memories-1"><a class="header" href="#end-of-isurds-past-memories-1">End of Isurd's Past Memories 1</a></h5>
<p>"Sir, you say they were like us... So perhaps... their colony was freed by Ouroboros at some point in the past?"</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "Well... I'm not sure... It looked like Nimue and the others had always been living off the land. Also, they'd been strictly shunning contact with others for generations." Taion awaited him to say more, "<em>Naturally, most people there gave me the cold shoulder. Before long,</em> I journeyed away from the colony. Along with Nimue."</p>
<p>"Nimue... left with you? Why, sir?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nimue and Isurd walking by a beach just outside of Nimue's original colony. Facing the sea, Nimue told Isurd, "There's a world out there... It'd be nice to see it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I wondered at her motivations. But I think I see now. Now we don't live under the Flame Clock's yoke, we're more free to consider our emotions. Back then, Nimue had to carefully... hide the fact that her Iris was unconnected to a Flame Clock. She listed a Nopon engineer to make the lens. Allll so she could live among us. And after that, she became the Nimue you know."</p>
<p>"<em>I never knew you two had such a connection. Incredible...</em> B-but, why show me this now?"</p>
<p>"Well... Actually..."</p>
<hr />
<p>After telling some story{{footnote: That we didn't know what.}}, Taion shockingly gasped, "<strong>What...? The leadership want Nimue's colony wiped out?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yeah. We only just heard. A Nopon merchant was able to tip us off. And since Nopon are involved in handling most logistics and transportation, the information should be good."</p>
<p>"So the brass have pinpointed its location?"</p>
<p>"Could be." He turned and walked towards a wall of the tent, with Taion following gaze. He stopped and think about it for a moment, eyes on the floor.</p>
<p>Then, Taion commented, "You don't have to be so cagey, Commander."</p>
<p>"Cagey?"</p>
<p>"You can tell it to me straight. Am I wrong? You'd like us to keep Nimue's colony safe."</p>
<p>"But..."</p>
<p>"Isn't that the reason? Why you've told me this whole story...? If you moved to protect the colony, it'd put this place in the line of fire... I've heard. Like how, after the Consul's disappearance and the loss of the Flame Clock, <strong>despite</strong> sending a report to HQ, you haven't received a <strong>word of reply</strong>."</p>
<p>"<em>Mmm...</em> We reported that it all happened while we lay there unconscious, which is the unvarnished truth... <em>Yet still nothing.</em>"</p>
<p>"I understand. <strong>Let me... run it</strong>... past the others, Commander." And he turned to leave the tent, to discuss with the group. He watched him left, though his hopes weren't high, at least from how his facial expression looked, the calm sadness that emanated.</p>
<hr />
<p>Camping outside Lambda, sitting in a circle around a campfire. The waterfall curtain forever shrouding the colony from revealing its location.</p>
<p>"What beautiful story!" Manana was enjoying Taion's story retelling.</p>
<p>Mio: "Those two must have shared a lot of memories..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Like you said, Taion, <em>it sounds like Ouroboros got involved in the past.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz concluded, "So that pretty much makes it our business. Count us in, mate!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Saffronia, that's that thingy, right? We saw one growin' once. If there's <strong>loads</strong> of 'em <strong>blooming</strong> somewhere, that's something I'd wanna see."</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh? I'm shocked!"</p>
<p>"What, a girl can like <em>flowers and junk.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Manana too! Manana have wish to see flowers!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena teased, "This is unusually proactive for you, Manana!"</p>
<p>"Why so? Ladies and flowers are like peas of same pod!"</p>
<p>Riku: "No idea what Manana talk about.{{footnote: HAHAHHA!!!}} But someone have to keep Manana out of trouble. That OK, with friend Taion?" So you're recommending yourself, eh!</p>
<p>"Sure. Thank you, everyone."</p>
<hr />
<p>Back inside the Commander's camp. The group discussed their decision with Isurd. He felt guilty, looking away as he spoke, "<em>Thanks.</em> I'm sorry to involve you in this."</p>
<p>Mio reassured, "Don't worry! We all agree that this is something we should do."</p>
<p>Eunie: "It's a while since we first got thrown together. We're used to this by now."</p>
<p>Sena: "And, y'know, we wanna see Saffronias!" Go girl!</p>
<p>His self-punishing doesn't subside, "It was me... I'm the one who threw Nimue's life into chaos. <em>I should have just left her where she was...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Commander...</em>"</p>
<p>"Taion?"</p>
<p>"Sir?"</p>
<p>"If... Nimue's been reborn... If she's in that colony... Keep her safe, by any means. This time, I want her to follow the path she was meant to tread."</p>
<p>"Yes, sir. I promise."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group walked outside and found Sena near the waterfall. She had walked faster than the rest of the group. Then, she turned around and voiced her doubt, "I don't get it. Why doesn't the Commander just come along?"</p>
<p>Lanz assumed "He's got no choice, right? He might get the attention of the Castle or something."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, "Ohh... Guess so..." That makes logical sense.</p>
<p>Mio: "That's not all, I think."</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>In her appreciation stance, she felt "I'm sure he must be scared. If he meets her again, he might end up behaving the same way towards her."</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't sure "If that's a bad thing?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't think so. But... I do understand, how he feels."</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "Yeah, I-I'd definitely hesitate. It's not- just- about himself."</p>
<p>Taion blamed himself, "<em>If I hadn't been so careless, the commander wouldn't have to feel this way...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "You're not <em>still</em> thinking <em>like that</em>, are you?"</p>
<p>He turned away from her, "N-no, I'm... I'm just..."</p>
<p>She got behind him, not wanting him to avoid her, "You're just what? <em>Lookin' back all the time never helped nobody.</em>"</p>
<p>"Look, I... I know."</p>
<p>She therefore gave him a slap on the back, "<strong>Right?</strong> Come on then."</p>
<p>"Eunie..."</p>
<p>"Uh?"</p>
<p>And there was a prolonged pause as he sort through his logic and emotions before he replied, "Ok. Sorry. I know you're right."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group quickly dashed behind a rock. Along the 'main entrance', they noticed Agnian levnises were drilling the rocks that blocked their way.</p>
<p>Noah quietly commented, "There's a Ferronis <em>here</em>?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Looks like it's trying to clear away the earth."</p>
<p>Sena: "No sneaking through with this big thing in the way."</p>
<p>Taion: "I think we've found the enemy force the commander mentioned."</p>
<p>"Hah..."</p>
<p>"Manana not see any people."</p>
<p>"Whole unit made up of <em>Levnises. Much weirdness.</em>" Good observation, Riku.</p>
<p>"Hang on. Look." Mio was pointing at a tiny guy behind those drilling levnises.</p>
<p>Sena turned her head there and noted, "A Consul. They haven't found us, have they?"</p>
<p>"No... I don't think they've spotted us just yet.{{footnote: Well, bro, you didn't even have your eyepatches on, are you sure?}} This one might have different abilities than that K guy."</p>
<p>"Guess that's a thing. <em>But why have only Levnises?</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>I can't fathom what this Moebius can do, but they're about to wipe out an allied colony.</em> They'd have a fun time explaining that to soldiers."</p>
<p>"True true."</p>
<p>"Let's hurry. All that digging will take some time. If we can bypass this unit, we <em>should</em> be able to beat them there." He was pointing to the right of his, where a tiny road was available to pass through for the people.{{footnote: Funny how the soldiers never found the road first; or maybe it doesn't allow their larger units to pass, so they ignored it? But shouldn't they'd blocked it just to prevent any 'accident' from happening?}}</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "Let's do that. <em>And make sure we don't get spotted</em>. Ready?" And the group had had some adventures later!</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group entered the inner part of the cave, taking their time, the floor started shaking. They stopped while Lanz shouted, "<strong>A fight?</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion quickly dashed past the others, worried. Noah clenched his eyebrow, exchanged glance with Mio, nodded to each other, then caught up behind him. The rest, seeing the decision made, followed thereafter.</p>
<p>4 Agnian soldiers set up a frequency shield; with a few blast, it shattered into inexistence. Four small guy against three giant levnises. From the flanks, Taion and his group arrived, himself noted, "Agnian Auto-Levs, is it...? But... who are they fighting...?"</p>
<p>The girl in front wearing a nurse hat, pale skin, pointing her spear at the guy. At the left of the diamond-shaped-formation, was a dark skin girl wielding dual swords. The one on the right with pale skin, the sword blocked our view of her{{footnote: Actually, it's Nimue, but let's not reveal it for those who don't read footnotes. :)}}, and the final guy pointing his gun at the floor, seemingly reloading.</p>
<p>Mio: "Could it be...?"</p>
<p>"<em>So it would seem</em>... Let's help them."</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Roger!</strong>" And they dashed in front of the group.{{footnote: Here, we could finally see Nimue, but let's conceal her identity for our fellow readers for now.}} They were not that surprised someone blocked in front of them. But no time to think; something is more pressing at the moment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Explosions broke the last of the auto levs and it crashed onto the ground. After the Ouroboros group sheathed their weapons, they turned to the still having their weapons defensive group, whom surprisingly let out a "Huh!!!" One by one Taion scanned the identity of the group until he found her on the right.{{footnote: Her teenage form, not as old or grown up as she was when she followed Isurd.}}</p>
<p>"Nimue! <em>Ma'am</em>..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Taion explained the situation to the four uninformed. Nimue looked at the nurse hat girl, exchanging info by eye contact, while Taion continued speaking, "I know it's hard for you to believe us. But... I promise you we aren't lying."</p>
<p>Nimue scanned the group to check her gut feelings before asking, "Can we really trust you?"</p>
<p>"<em>Nimue...</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Uh, I-I-I mean..." To conceal his nervousness, he turned to the auto levs, "These Levnises were unmanned. It's likely they were a <em>scouting party</em>." As he calmed down, he turned to her again, "<em>The main force</em>... They're drawing near." And they looked at each other's eyes for a long moment while Nimue considered, then nodded,</p>
<p>"Very well. I'll choose to trust you." Turning to the nurse hat girl, she nodded, agreed with her decision. And the two others whom seemed to be shaking and 'hugging each other' at the back, they also agreed. "However, I do not speak for our entire colony. The others will decide on their own. Follow me. I'll take you to meet our chief."</p>
<p>Taion caught the key word, "'Chief'?..." But they had already lead the way, not answering his curiosity. They could only follow her to find out.</p>
<hr />
<p>They ended up setting 2 campfire by some dirt-ish place. While the others were chatting, Nimue too steps toward the 'lonely' Taion. He was analyzing some data from his Iris when Nimue called, "Sir- Taion, was that your name?"</p>
<p>He closed his iris and turned his attention to her, nervously, "Huh? Uh oh, yes. No 'sir', though. Just Taion." Now that she'd only been reborn not long ago, she was far shorter than he; a young Nimue.</p>
<p>"Taion... Before, you called me Nimue... How, did you know my name?"</p>
<p>"Ummm, well, you see..." As his blush got redder and redder, he found a way to cover it up without revealing the story, "<strong>Right! Your... dog tag! On your...</strong>"</p>
<p>Nimue tilted her head, not sure what he's talking about, "Dog tag?" He dropped his head to look at her chest. Nope, nothing can be labeled "dog tag" was there. She looked down herself and, nope, nothing she saw! Blank shirt that is!</p>
<p>Scratching his head, "Wh-what...?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Taion...?</strong>" You just told me a lie!</p>
<p>"<strong>I... guessed!</strong>" He then flipped his hair up as if to make himself look more clever. "<strong>I-I-I-I-I... I'm told I-I-I have a great intuition!</strong> Guessing a name for me, pfft, it isn't even a challenge!"</p>
<p>She just looked at him in his eyes for a long while before exclaiming, "<strong>Wow, is that true?!</strong>" She really believed it! She really believed it!!!</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah, you bet!</strong> Uhuh, pfft, ahem ahem..." He therefore scratched his head to conceal his nervousness and lying.</p>
<p>Eunie and Sena, watching their interaction like watching a movie, the former complaint badly, "<strong>GRRRRRR, this is doin' my head it! Just snuffin' TELL her! Urggggh!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Great idea!</strong> ...Not." And she cosplayed Taion, "'By the way, Nimue, you're the reincarnation of my old boss!' <strong>Who's gonna believe that?</strong> It sounds crazy as all spark, dude!" Noah and Mio were also watching the interactions, sitting on another bench neighboring Eunie and Sena's.</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie... we've had a... lot... longer to get used to all this stuff, remember?"</p>
<p>And she did the baby snorting sound, "Nguhhhhhh..."</p>
<p>"Ur huhuh!"</p>
<p>"Hey. Somethin' funny, love?" She asked Mio in a machine gun speed.</p>
<p>"Nothing... You're being very <em>'Eunie'</em>. But I like that about you."</p>
<p>"Oi, what's that s'posed to mean? <em>Eunie is as Eunie does.</em>"</p>
<p>"Besides..."</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"I think it's not just the rebirthing thing. He's feeling the same as Isurd, Taion is." And they focused on his interaction with Nimue, still scratching his head as he lied his way to impress her.</p>
<p>Watching for a while, Eunie commented, "<em>Poor fella.</em>"</p>
<p>At the center stage, Nimue looked at "Your... Blade..."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Taion turned to look at where she look. It was the Mondo on the table by the cup of tea he'd made. The Mondo, lying on the table resting, bounced up and waved to her greetings.</p>
<p>"I have the same."</p>
<p>"Oh... that? T-that's true... You're the one who taught me."</p>
<p>"I did?" Oops...</p>
<p>Putting his hand on his glasses to hide his nervousness again, "Ahh, no... I meant, someone who looked like you! <em>Yeah, her...</em>"</p>
<p>"Right..." She felt something he doesn't want to tell her yet, decided to go forward. The mood just got darker suddenly.</p>
<p>He asked, "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"You all... came from outside, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"What's it like, out there?" Her curiosity insatiable. And his head dropped to the ground, unsure if he wanted to seduce her, like Isurd did ages ago. "This place... is... all... we know. We're... not allowed to leave. It's forbidden, you see."</p>
<p>"<em>Ohhh...</em>" They turned to face the same direction together. "<em>Honestly... It's not all that wonderful.</em>" And after some storytelling later,</p>
<p>"A world of endless war... People taking each others' lives away..."</p>
<p>"Yes. It's a pitiful place."</p>
<p>"Still... Even so, I want to go. I need to see it. A world wide open." The same direction they were facing, was the entrance. All they could see was the far away island separated by vast sea.</p>
<p>Taion discouraged, "You'd have to fight too."</p>
<p>"But, you're not <em>like that, are you?</em>"</p>
<p>"Uhhh?"</p>
<p>"It's a sad world, but you're trying to change it. Am I wrong?"</p>
<p>"Well, ahhh..."</p>
<p>"If there are people like you in that world, well then, I'm sure it's wonderful. And <em>that</em>... is what I want to see." And her bright purple iris was all that he look at when he kept quiet, unsure how to proceed to prevent taking her to the same fate as before her rebirth.</p>
<hr />
<p>360°, Saffronias blooming around the internal cavern, both lower storey and upper storey. At the very top was an opening for sunlight to enter. The group stopped to enjoy the view, and Eunie was flabbergasted,</p>
<p>"Ho!"</p>
<p>There were some small waterfall that spills from the rocks at the upper storey onto the lake at the lower storey. The lake consists of several island, some joined to the main ones (which they were on) which was more soily than beachy, while the others smaller ones were pure beach island.</p>
<p>"Ha!"</p>
<p>"Meh meh!"</p>
<p>"Meh!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Pr-et-ty!"</p>
<p>"Glad you like them." Nimue commented, "They're nearly in full bloom. Give it three more days... and they'll be covering the whole cliffside."</p>
<p>"Wow!!! Now <em>that</em> I wanna see."</p>
<p>Sena was also excited, "Yeah!"</p>
<p>"The chief is over there. Let's go!" She turned to look at the largest hut some distance from the entrance where they were. It was also on a higher platform and a slope leading up to it from where they were.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the chief house, Taion explained their situation to the female chief{{footnote: Stella's the name.}}, slightly tanned with dark hair, emerald iris, and young of course{{footnote: Well why not, when they can only live for 10 years? So, it's not like the stereotypical chief whom their wrinkles were so wrinkly that you can't even see their eyes, their beard so thick you can't see their mouth if male, etc.}}</p>
<p>"I thank you, kind outsiders. Though, I'm afraid we will not be leaving this place."</p>
<p>"<strong>But why? There are troops on the way coming to kill you! You don't expect to just beg for your life? CHIEF!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Since ages past, we have prospered in this land we call home. Even knowing war rages on constantly in the outside world..."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"If that war is to reach our land, then I'm happy to accept our fate. Or... you could call it our punishment."</p>
<p>"<em>Punish-?!</em> Wh-"</p>
<p>"<strong>Outsiders.</strong> As thanks for assisting Nimue's team, we prepared chambers. <em>However, that is only for tonight. Tomorrow, I would ask you to leave.</em> We must follow... the path which fate has set for us."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ngrh!</strong>" Nothing could change her will.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group were lead to their chambers, they saw the people planting, sowing the fields.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Is... this place a crop-growing colony? You barely ever see any of these in Keves."</p>
<p>Mio: "Seems like a nice way to live. It's warm, they live in comfort."</p>
<p>Sena: "Yeah. How could they deserve punishment?"</p>
<p>Taion was walking as someone caught his eyes. Turning and stopping, he saw Nimue tending to the crops in one of the fields, back on him. "Hmmm..."</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Some shadow lurched on the bottom left of his eyes. He turned and saw Eunie taking out something from her pocket. It was a dog tag.</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>"I think... this was from <em>another me.</em> Remember the battlefield at Kana? I found it there."</p>
<p>"Back there?" There was a long pause as they absorbed what info they'd just received, or just enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>"Is Nimue... <em>different</em> from before?"</p>
<p>"No. <em>She hasn't changed.</em> Same old Nimue."</p>
<p>"<em>Well. Maybe it's the same with me then.</em>" She smilingly commented, and suddenly "Wait, hang on. Do you reckon the past <em>me</em> was more like her?"</p>
<p>"In what way?"</p>
<p>"Elegant, graceful, refined."</p>
<p>"Ahah! No way. You'll be the same no matter... <strong>how</strong> many times you're reborn."</p>
<p>And she crossed her arms and looked sideways, seemingly not happy. Thinking he had offended her, he got nervous and panickingly apologized, "<strong>Oh, no! S-sorry! I didn't...</strong> What I wanted to say, was..."</p>
<p>She was thinking something else, "<em>I don't... suppose we could change.</em> <strong>But you know,</strong> some things are different sometimes."</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>"<strong>'Cause this time round, we're Ouroboros.</strong> Things'll be different. <em>We're with you, Taion.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Eunie?</em>" And there was a long pause as he looked at her tilting her head sideways while having her eyes on him. "<strong>Huh!</strong> I didn't expect encouragement from <em>you</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>Well</strong>, you do make a good cuppa."</p>
<p>"Huh huh huh huh!" And they continued their pace towards their destination.</p>
<p>Nimue just finished tending her crops, stood up, and saw the group walking. But this time, his eyes weren't on her anymore. "Hmmm..."</p>
<hr />
<p>As they were arriving at their quarters, Taion stopped and commented, "At this rate, it's going to be up to us."</p>
<p>Lanz heard him, turned around, questioned, "Can we manage? There's plenty of 'em."</p>
<p>Eunie reminded, "No people though. Maybe we can just let rip out here then?"</p>
<p>"I mean, <em>I guess so</em>, but..."</p>
<p>Noah voiced the result, "If we don't, this place is done for. Only one choice left to us."</p>
<p>Taion: "Right." As he slowly scanned their quarters, something caught Taion's eyes. One could only see Saffronia's leaves falling, but he saw something more, "What's that?"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the bottom of the short cliff which bordered their living quarters, on the white beach that face the lake, they saw the wreckage at the bottom of the beach island. It had the white plates and red stripes of an Agnian. With Taion in lead, the others walked up to him. He was looking up, analyzing the wreckage when Noah asked, "Taion, what's up?"</p>
<p>"It's just... this Ferronis."</p>
<p>Noah looked up and saw the broken Ferronis still had its Flame Clock. Weirdly, there were still flames in the Flame Clock! Though, it was so dim that it was about to die.</p>
<p>"A Flame Clock?!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Oh man, and it even works... It's just a flicker, but still..."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "Is it this colony's lifeforce?"</p>
<p>Taion rejected the hypothesis, "<em>No... I don't believe so</em>. It's ancient, so it must be a malfunction or something. Remember the people here aren't part of the Flame Clock system."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You make a good point."</p>
<p>After some pondering, he raised his head and loudly exclaimed, "<strong>I've got it! All of this, it's this thing's fault!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh? What is?</strong>"</p>
<p>He walked forward, commenting, "It was <em>really</em> bothering me. This place has been safe <strong>all this time. Why is Moebius just now taking notice?</strong>" Looking over his shoulder at the group, "<em>This is why.</em> For whatever reason, this decrepit Ferronis has come back online."</p>
<p>Noah got it, "Huh! That's how they found out?"</p>
<p>"<em>Indeed. After all this time...</em> It's bad luck for the people here." And he pondered for more logical chain while the group waited.</p>
<p>Sena prompted after some waiting, "Taion?"</p>
<p>He didn't answer her, questioned "Riku, do you know much about Ferronises?" instead.</p>
<p>"Silly question. Maintaining Colony 9 Ferronis, was one of many jobs of Riku."</p>
<p>Lanz bluntly chucked out, "Oh yeah, right. That sure kept you busy."</p>
<p>Taion: "That's perfect. Then, could you take a look at this?"</p>
<p>"What for?"</p>
<p>"If it still happens to work... <em>we just might save this place.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "N-nope, no way. <strong>So what</strong> if we get it to work? This thing's fighting days are <em>done</em>!"</p>
<p>"<em>It won't have to fight.</em> We're going to play a little trick."</p>
<p>"A... trick?"</p>
<hr />
<p>After Riku did a maintenance check on the Ferronis, he came back. Taion, already impatient with the waiting, immediately questioned, "How is it?"</p>
<p>"Friend was right. Ferronis can still move. Drive works barely. <em>But Riku think it <strong>will</strong> run.</em>"</p>
<p>"Can you repair it?"</p>
<p>"If we find several parts... then possible."</p>
<p>"How long do you need?"</p>
<p>"Friend telling Riku to hurry? Well, mechanicist of Riku's talents can do this in thirty minutes.{{footnote: WT Snuff, that's quick!}}"</p>
<p>Sena then asked the next logical question, "Can we get our hands on these parts in time?"</p>
<p>Riku turned around and scanned the surrounding, "There lots of Ferronis and Levnis wrecks <strong>sprinkled</strong> around here. Must be something Riku can use."</p>
<p>Taion: "Understood. Start making preparations for repairs." And Riku acknowledged. Turning to the others, he ordered, "Let's split up and search for the parts we need."</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "Sure. We'll handle it."{{footnote: Now that we looked closer, it didn't seem to be white beach, but water that reached halfway to their ankle; or for the Nopon, waist-high.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>As they were looking around, Nimue had found the lonely Taion whom was looking at the Ferronis. Riku was up on the Ferronis (with Eunie?) making reparations, while the rest of the group seemed to search for more parts around the Ferronis. She cut Taion's pondering short, "You're going to fight?"</p>
<p>He turned to her thereafter, "Err, not quite. We're um..."</p>
<p>She didn't wait for him to finish, "Taion, I want to fight too."</p>
<p>"<strong>No way!</strong> I'm not letting you get mixed up in all this!" His voice was stern in this. He had lost her once. He cannot lose her a second time in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>"So you really <em>are</em> going to fight."</p>
<p>"Argh!!!" Got tricked!</p>
<p>"You could..." She walked forward and took his left hand, hamburgered it with both her palm, "...get hurt." She in her child age was short compared to his grown up age; her head barely on his chest.</p>
<p>"Huh...!"</p>
<p>"If someone dies, I couldn't take it, sitting here pretending none of that is happening." And he turned his head to another direction, looking at the floor, unable to look at her. She continued, "I understand our chief's feelings... It's thanks to her that we've lived in peace this long.{{footnote: So after she's reborn, she became the chief again? But did she retained her memories? How does "this long" means? From since the beginning of the village existence?}} But, there's a war going on in the outside world. There are many... <em>who don't want</em> to see it. Or with it wasn't happening to them. Yet, you've come to us following your own path. And that is real! It's how the world really is!"</p>
<p>"Nimue..."</p>
<p>"Please...!"</p>
<p>He put her arms around one of hers, hamburgered each other, unable to reject her decision, refusingly agreed, "All right. I'll allow you to watch us, while we're fighting. <strong>But</strong> -- under <strong>one</strong> condition."</p>
<p>"That is?"</p>
<p>He looked at the Saffronias and the village, "When we first came here, it was like an <em>awakening.</em> There are still beautiful places like <em>this</em> in the world. We have to keep <em>this place safe. That's what we're fighting for.</em>" Turning back to her, "Once you've seen how we do <em>things, promise me that you'll protect this place. That fight... <strong>belongs</strong> to you.</em>"{{footnote: So that's how he prevented her from leaving the colony this resurrection.}}</p>
<p>"<em>My own... fight...</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"You have a deal, Taion. I'll watch all of you... how you fight. I'll burn it... into here." And she put her crystal hand on her heart.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group waited for Riku to finish his final work, until he turned around and announced, "Riku done! Time to light fire!" As Taion nodded, Riku took out his terminal and summoned the controller, activating it. The Ferronis therefore eyes lit up, stood up, reconnecting its joints.</p>
<p>"Brilliant! It works!" Riku was back on the ground, standing beside Taion. Taion nodded to him, congratulating him; while he put his wings on both side, proud. The Ferronis then started moving itself towards some direction.</p>
<p>Lanz was alarmed, "H-hey... Was it meant to float away?"</p>
<p>"Yes. It was."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Riku, did you input the coordinates?"</p>
<p>"Of course! Riku fed Ferronis numbers <strong>just</strong> as directed."</p>
<p>Eunie wanted to know "What's going on?"</p>
<p>Taion explained, "We've made ourselves a lure."</p>
<p>"A lure?"</p>
<p>There was a long pause before Lanz exclaimed, "<em>Now I get it</em>. That thing's gonna... lure in the Moebius and beat it up?"</p>
<p>Taion: "They know about this place because of that thing's Flame Clock. As such, Moebius are probably watching out for that Ferronis."</p>
<p>Mio: "So we'll make the Moebius think that the Ferronis sensed their approach? And that it's going to attack?"</p>
<p>"Honestly, I would give it about fifty-fifty. Let's hope this particular Moebius is a complete fool..."</p>
<p>That reminded Eunie, she teasingly recalled, "Anyone remember P?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "And then, we can all swoop in and <strong>rinse</strong> this mudder. Gotta love a nice and simple plan!"</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "What happens after we beat them? Won't they end up coming back... as long as the Ferronis is there?"</p>
<p>"I haven't forgotten about that. I've got a little <em>something</em> in mind." And Riku nodded back to him, seeming already knew what his <em>something</em> is, and had already put it into actions.</p>
<p>Nimue: "Thank you, Taion."</p>
<p>He turned to look at her, acknowledged her, "Between us... we'll make it work for sure... And keep the Saffronias safe."</p>
<hr />
<p>They followed the Ferronis which had floated towards the entrance. It stopped just behind the uncleared rocks. Lanz questioned, "Is it go time?"</p>
<p>Mio seemed to heard something, turned to the other direction and found some Auto-Levs raising their arms. The situation was dire. "<strong>Taion!</strong>" Taion nodded to Mio. The 3 Auto-Levs lowered their left arm and shoot 4 beams from their right arm's fingers at the Ferronis. The beams blasted at the rocks and the Ferronis.</p>
<p>"Here we go!" Sena was ready.</p>
<p>Taion confirmed now, "Great! This guy really is an idiot." He nodded to Riku, the latter took out his terminal and controlled the Ferronis to kill one of the Auto-Levs. Meanwhile, Taion signaled to the others, "While those Ferronises are busy fighting, we'll move in from behind. We'll hit them where it'll hurt them the most -- <em>the Consul.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Got it!" And they ran to their location. Riku doesn't need to control the Ferronis; just ordered it to attack and it had AI to do so.</p>
<hr />
<p>The Consul was watching the fight when (s)he sensed people arriving from behind. "Ah! It's you lot...! Wait... This is a trap?!" From the voice, it's the parrot voice, V.{{footnote: He appeared before in Noah's side story, 1000 years ago, to kill a soldier under Crys.}}</p>
<p>Lanz happily insult him, "<strong>Sorry about that, mate! Turns out</strong> <em>you</em>, had a bit of a brain fart!"</p>
<p>Taion quietly upvoted his comment, "Nice one..."</p>
<p>V: "Oh - <strong>ARRRRGHHHHH!! Impossible!</strong> Could I really have been fooled by these peons?! <strong>My mighty self?! RIDICULOUS!!! Not a chance! This just isn't happening!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie shook her head, "This guy's in serious denial. Anyhow, looks like he's genuinely clueless about Nimue and the others."</p>
<p>Taion warned, "Promise us you'll turn around and go back <em>the way you came</em>, and we will let you go. Give a message to your masters, <em>if you even have any.</em> Tell them <strong>exactly</strong> how you <strong>fell</strong> into our trap!"</p>
<p>"<strong>W-What?!!</strong> You think I'm some lowly errand boy? Stuff your messages. <strong>I'm all about the screaming!</strong> And I will enjoy yours <em>before the day is through!</em> That's why I am Moebius!"</p>
<p>Sena sniped: "Why are they all so gross?!"</p>
<p>"<strong>I will never turn back! I will cut through!</strong>" And he transformed into his Moebius form, promising himself that "<strong>I will fill this valley with the echoes of your dying screams!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>MY LORD ZZZZZZ!!!!!</strong>" Dark particles were escaping his core; he no longer can be save-able. "<strong>MY APOLOGIEEEEESSSS!!!!</strong>" And blue motes exploded from his body as they floated up the sky.</p>
<p>Lanz was curious, "What's he saying sorry for? Creep."</p>
<p>The plan wasn't yet completed, Taion shouted, "<strong>OK! Now, Riku!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Understanding!</strong>" He brought out his terminal and pressed a button after summoned the control terminal. The screen immediately turned red. Then, the Flame Clock started becoming unstable and the green filled so bright its core. Overclocking, it aimed towards the entrance, killing all Auto-Levs on its way. The other Ferronis brought by V was waiting there, firing beams, but it could not stop it. It hugged into that other Ferronis and self-destruct, creating an explosion that engulfed both of them.</p>
<p>Noah was shocked at the scene, "What did you-!"</p>
<p>No time to think about that. Taion warned, "<strong>Guys, take cover!</strong>" And he was the first to turn around, hugging Nimue and brought himself and her to the floor. The rest followed suit, brought themselves as close to the floor as possible just before the explosion.</p>
<hr />
<p>Flames raging all the place. Amidst soot, Lanz was the first to stand back up, commented, "Now <strong>that</strong>... was an explosion. <strong>What the spark did you do?</strong>"</p>
<p>Riku questioned, "Friend want to know?"</p>
<p>"<em>Dunno</em>. Will it take long?"</p>
<p>"Explaining principles take half a day."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then I'll pass</strong>."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well, whatever the snuff happened, it all went down a treat."</p>
<p>Mio put herself in their shoes, "If I was a Moebius, I'd at least try to check the situation before going all in..."</p>
<p>Sena: "Seriously, what a total dingus."</p>
<p>Taion: "Anyway, we got the best possible outcome. <em>Amazing.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the village, Taion was to bade farewell to Nimue. Her voice filled with excitement, "Taion, I saw everything. The way you fought... Do you spend <em>every</em> day battling like this?" The last she felt sad.</p>
<p>"Gladly... yes."</p>
<p>"Huh?" How is that glad?</p>
<p>He knelt down to be the lower height than her, "We need the people of your colony to protect this place. It's true, there are times when our fight takes a toll on us. But we carry on that fight, <em>because we have a mission.</em>"</p>
<p>"A mission?" She tilted her head, don't understand yet.</p>
<p>Standing back up, "The foe we fought today... Moebius, <em>who made this world the way it is</em>... We <strong>have</strong> to take it back from them. We <strong>have</strong> to make a new world. <em>One without fighting</em>, where you won't have to <strong>hide</strong> away in fear."</p>
<p>"Taion..."</p>
<p>"But... sometimes we do need rest. To forget fighting <em>for a time.</em> This place... could be our refuge."</p>
<p>"I understand. Then we'll protect this land. So that whenever you grow tired of your fight, you can return here, to rest."</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you.</em>" And she acknowledged.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were leaving. Taion stood in front of Nimue, bade final farewell to her before turning around to join the group. Only she sent the group on. He had something to say before leaving, without looking at her, stopping, "<em>Our mission...</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Turning around, "<strong>If we manage to win, there's someone I want you to meet... someday!</strong>" And she thinly smiled back. The dropping Saffronia leaves therefore froze the final moments of their current journey. It'll be a long time if they are to come back again.</p>

<p>Near the ship dock, at Samon's engineering department, the group gathered behind the table where Samon originally laid out his blueprints for their Origin-piercing ship. While they were waiting for him to complete his work, Lanz announced: "Finally... Origin."</p>
<p>Noah was thinking about the final moments before the Moebius they fought die:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<strong>Noooooo... I don't want to diiiiieeeee!!!</strong>" And the first time they saw a Moebius wrinkled face.</p>
<p>And he remember the O and P ugly interlink. And the explosion of Joran and D's.</p>
<p>"Moebius are... an entity bound by the confines of this world. Strong, yet somehow fragile..." And Crys's disappearance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"<em>Moebius... What even <strong>are</strong> they...? Harvesting our lives, to cling to life... Even stopping time...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Mio?" Clearly, she was the only one whom inherited a Moebius's memories, she should know something, right? "Allowing for limiting conditions, we are reborn after we have died. Are Moebius as well?"</p>
<p>"Moebius, uh... They can't be brought back once they die."</p>
<p>"<em>Why is that?</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure, myself. Although, each of them is fundamentally aware of this. That's why they're afraid. Of death."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>They're scared</strong>, huh? I guess... <em>Joran knew too.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>And he still... killed himself... And now, he's really gone.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Still, he left us a parting gift."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah... The smile on his face..." That was what he recalled. "I'll never forget it. Not until my dying breath."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Mm...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "What lies beyond death, that Moebius fear it so? What the Queen said, about the key that we hold... That smile might be it."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "Because he broke free of Z's control?" And he returned nod.</p>
<p>Taion voiced it clear, "<em>The power of hope... If we're being trite.</em>"</p>
<p>"Power to create future? Big props from Manana!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Any way you slice it, <strong>it's not about lookin' backwards.</strong> More like, the <em>opposite</em>."</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "There no need to wrack brains about. Riku think it fine to just be true to self."</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciative stance, "Riku makes a good point. Wanting to do what <em>we</em> want, to be how <em>we</em> want to be... that's how we should carry on." And she looked to Noah, whom agreed with her.</p>
<p>"In that case... I'll continue down the road... of the future that was meant to be..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"If I were given the chance... If this road I've walked... were to keep on going... I'd like to spend that time... with my Noah."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And Mio nodded back. Sena, Lanz, Eunie, Taion, dropped their head to the side, thinking. Noah continued, "Forever isn't <strong>it</strong>... "</p>
<hr />
<p>The group met Samon at the port. Noah: "Mr. Samon?"</p>
<p>"Meh, I wait for you long time. Engine already installed." And they look at the ship; the external view doesn't change, as expected. "Finally... Finally she <strong>finished and perfect!!!</strong>" And he jingles his feet on the ground as if he won first place. Manana punched her wings into the air to celebrate with him.</p>
<p>Sena: "Congratulations, Mr. Samon!"</p>
<p>Noah: "So now we'll be able to go to Origin."</p>
<p>Samon turned and asked, "Riku will be pilot, yes?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative!" And he dabbed!</p>
<p>"Samon send Riku information on how to steer and on equipment loadout. But first..."</p>
<p>Lanz suggested before Samon even finished, "Let's look around!"</p>
<p>"Meh! You all hasty as always... Samon is basking in his achievement now. Listen to explanation of ship!"</p>
<p>Eunie, dull-ly, "Yeahhh, Mr. Samon, we don't really get all your technical talk... We'll leave all that to Riku, yeah?"</p>
<p>Similarly from Lanz: "That's fine, right?"</p>
<p>Riku agreed, "Oh, this very fine, yes..." Only Samon bent his head and slammed it on the ground, defeated by their lack of passion.</p>
<p>After he jumped back up, "Samon have calculate optimum route for throwing ship at vortex. Waters around Farview Cape are good. Samon send precise coordinates, friends verify later."</p>
<p>Mio was surprised, "You'd do all of that for us?" Feeling appreciative, "Mr. Samon, thank you so much. Without you, we wouldn't be able to join the battle."</p>
<p>"You let Samon help this much. Just come back alive for sure!"</p>
<p>Noah promised, "We will!"</p>
<hr />
<p>A fleet of ships, including their new ship plus other Lost Numbers fighting units, pressed on, zooming toward their destination at traveling speed{{footnote: i.e. they're not speeding, nor are they on 'enjoying the view' speed.}} Inside the ship, Riku briefed the group, seated and waiting to arrive at their destination. "We here. Middle of Great Sea. Noah! Please to activate cloaking device." So Noah and Riku were both driving the ship, Riku main, Noah helping. The rest seated at the back.</p>
<p>"Roger." With electric sparkles, the ship became highly translucent{{footnote: nearly transparent. Being translucent, you can still see the refraction of light if viewed carefully.}}, and the only thing that could give them up is the waves along which they drift. "Cloaking activated. No issues yet."</p>
<p>Sena was self-questioning at the back, "Are we sure this is really gonna work...? They're not gonna, like, open fire when we get too close...?"</p>
<p>Mio recalled herself being half-Moebius when they met the Queen, "Maybe I shouldn't be here. If it ends up working to our disadvantage..."</p>
<p>"We cross bridge when we get to." Riku boosted their luckiness, raising his eyebrow, "<strong>Eh, anyhow, we small target</strong>, so won't take every bullet."</p>
<p>Eunie was getting nervous, "<strong>Riku, you don't seem to be taking this</strong> seriously..."</p>
<p>On another ship, Ghondor overheard their conversations{{footnote: Seemingly they're on open-communication at all times.}} while driving her ship, "If worse comes to worst, we'll try to draw the heat for ya. Heh. That'll take the wind outta their sails!" Her image was casted real-time in front of Noah.</p>
<p>Sena: "OK...? Hey, uh, what's a 'sail' again...?" Bro, is that even important now? Or maybe, she just wanted that as a distraction.</p>
<p>Lanz, in a low but unrelenting tone, "We've made it this far. <strong>Just quit worrying. Go with the flow, yeah?</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion immediately retorted, "<strong>Spark's sake</strong>, talk about carefree..."</p>
<p>Riku announced, "It go time! <strong>Full power to engine!</strong> There be a <em>little</em> drop, <strong>so make sure to hold on tight</strong>!"</p>
<p>Eunie was getting more nervous, "<strong>WAIT... WHAT DROP?!</strong>" Even Lanz and Sena eyes widened, shocked at being informed last second. At the other side, Mio and Taion eyes widened too, Manana questioned,</p>
<p>"Mehmehmeh??? <strong>NEED PRIOR WARNING!!!</strong> Meh-<strong>MEEEEEHHHHHH???!!!</strong>"  Too late, the ship already jumped off the waterfall-falling-like vortex. With full speed to the rocket boosters engine, they temporarily floated out of water in the middle of the air than going down with the water-fall, before nosediving straight for the vortex. Weirdly, the other ships were also following them dropping. Is it not yet at the hull-breaking vortex, so they won't yet rip apart?</p>
<hr />
<p>The voices inside Z was noisy. He opened his eyes, just waken from a short nap, sensed them, "So you've <em>come</em>... Ouroboros." Their cloaking is of no use, clearly displayed in front of Z's cinema screen, tracking them down.</p>
<hr />
<p>They were still in their cloaking state as they were approached the vortex tornado. The rain were getting heavy the nearer they got{{footnote: From water being sucked up and fall back down.}}. Finally, the intensely strong wind, the intensely big rocky waves.</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Huh? Check it! The sea's looking funky!</strong>"</p>
<p>Riku: "<strong>It not only sea!</strong>" Yeah, tornado, with electric sparkles inside the tornado... The ship was starting to get very shaky, extremely turbulent.</p>
<p>Manana: "<strong>No-no-no! We going to get blown away!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Ngh-... We can hold on!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah strain his eyes to look clearly, "<strong>Something's... coming!</strong>" They couldn't yet see what it is yet, shrouded behind the tornado it is.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Out on the other side...</em> <strong>What is that?</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "I sense Moebius... Lots of them, beyond the vortex... It must be... Origin!"</p>
<p>The group were also looking through the windscreen. Lanz asked, "<strong>So that shadow, that's what we're after?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie exclaimed, "<strong>It's sparking ginormous!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Easily ten times the size of a Castle..."</p>
<p>Noah: "The place where everything began... Origin. The Kevesi Queen is there... Not to mention..."</p>
<p>Inside the cinema room, Z was waiting. "Why even <em>resist</em>...? When you could simply resign yourself <em>to the flow</em>..." And he stood up, walking forward, "<strong>The endless now</strong> <em>is our cherished wish</em>. Any resisters will <em>be pacified, and returned to the</em> <strong>perpetual cycle</strong>..." And he opened his arms as to embrace the return. And there were six red 'eyes' (light), arranged in a hexagon, that blinked in and out in the 'no signal' cinema screen.</p>
<hr />
<p>From within the vortex, Origin shot multiple purple beams at different directions. Some of that blasted some Ferronis and Levnises far on the land. They can't even withstand one hit. Though, one of the Agnian Ferronis managed to raise a frequency shield that prolonged its death; but it wasn't long before the shield overburdened and broke under the beam, evaporating together with the Ferronis, the latter immediately dislocate and became unusable, crashing to the ground below.</p>
<p>One of the beam was directed at the fleet. It destroyed one of the ship just beside the Ouroboros's, a 'just miss'. Inside, some were making distressed screams as Riku and Noah navigated their way away from being shot. The energy nonetheless were so strong it broke their cloaking layer, shaking the whole fleet out of cloaking state.</p>
<hr />
<p>The fallen does not stop Origin from continued blasting, sending beams past them to further inland. Inside Bravery{{footnote: the name of the vortex-poking ship, just in case you forget the name. The earlier ship is 'Boundary'.}}, Noah and the others watched the wretched state the beams left, the raging flames that engulfed the remains of the vehicles, of the rocks and hills and mountains.</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Oh, crap...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Moebius mudders... <strong>What're they thinking?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena noted, "They're even shooting at Colonies that haven't been freed!"</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>Taking potshots now?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>They're still their allies!</em> <strong>Have they lost the plot?</strong>" Mio just looked sad in her eyes.</p>
<p>Just then, someone asked over the COM, "You alive?"</p>
<p>And Mio's eyes widened as "<strong>Monica!</strong>" appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>Ghondor joined in the conversation, "<em>Just barely...</em> They dropped one of our ships... How're you?"</p>
<p>She was inside the control room deck of the 'City Ferronis', with soldiers at the various terminals doing the control{{footnote: Like the Captain on board on Star Trek calling out instructions to the various minions in front of their control panels, if you'd watch that before.}}, replying to them, whom also showed their face (Noah and Ghondor) in front of the huge screen, "We're holding out here. Bastards... I can't believe they're firing at their own. <strong>I thought we were</strong> the only ones they wanted gone."</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Yeah. If this keeps up, they'll as good as raze the entire world."</p>
<p>Eunie: "They're all about life, aren't they?"</p>
<p>Mio rationalized, "As long as they have Origin, they can keep on making more of us. For them, this might just count as charging up. Reveling in the final glimmers of our lives." And the half-Moebius-half-Ouroboros symbol glowed in her iris.</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>They want us to flicker out...</em>"</p>
<p>"When the last light fades, they're planning on starting over. In a world without us."</p>
<p>"Grrr..."</p>
<p>Lanz dropped his head, "That's all kinds of messed up."</p>
<p>Manana shouted, "<strong>PLEASE TO LOOK THERE!</strong>" On screen, it showed a Kevesi Ferronises (and Levnises) lining up on the edge, firing beams and shots into the vortex. Even if most exploded outside the vortex, destroyed by the tornado, they didn't stop. Even if one or two get passed lucky and reached Origin, it will count.</p>
<p>Sena recognized, "Isn't that... the Colony 30 detachment?!"{{footnote: Commander: Valdi.}}</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>But that's SUICIDE!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio, shouted as if they could hear, "<strong>TURN AROUND!!!</strong>" But her shout could not reach them. One purple beam blasted at them and wiped over them, leaving ashes and flames instantaneously.</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the cinema, Z watched the colony rebelling, "<em>Such drama</em>... So much unavoidable <em>tragedy,</em> in order to preserve... the endless <em>now</em>... Fear not. You need not grieve." And he grasped his hands into a fist, "Lives come back around... In due time, you will <strong>all</strong>, be reborn, <em>once again...</em>" And he opened up his hands wide to embrace. It was his stage; and he was the only one inside the cinema watching himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>More beams reached every inch of the world, trimming the land of Aionios with flames and forces{{footnote: Newton's force, one meant.}}, be there people or not, be there colonies or not, be there animals and plants or not.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were still speeding towards their destination as another beam shot past them. Manana screamed again, "<strong>Meh-meeeeh!!!</strong>" They dodged their head aside, as if that would help steer the ship.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "Tch... <strong>Those punks are gettin' rowdy!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "They do seem <strong>thoroughly committed</strong> to ensuring our deaths, yes."</p>
<p>Watching the beams, Noah was in deep thought, "Or maybe... they're not even <em>conscious</em> of the whole <em>notion</em> of killing."</p>
<p>"<strong>How so?</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's like a natural instinct... To them, it's as basic as breathing..."</p>
<p>Monica: "Nice theory, <em>kid</em>, but don't make <em>excuses for 'em.</em>"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"<em>Huhuh</em>.. All right then. <strong>GHONDOR!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hmph... Guess it's time to pull out all the stops. We'll play the decoy <em>for ya</em>! You guys gun it, yeah? Go and clear us out a path! <strong>A path to give this world a future!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ghondor... We got it. <strong>If we're gonna get to the vortex, we'll need your help!</strong>" And they both nodded and disappeared from the screen to focus on their job. "<strong>Riku, pass me the controls!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Aye-aye!</strong>"</p>
<p>"How's the engine doing?" He was busy dodging incoming beams while pushing forward to their destination.</p>
<p>"Spick and span. Admittedly, we lose some instruments to attack just now... but engine proper is raring to go!"</p>
<p>"All right. Let's punch clear through! <strong>HOLD ON TO SOMETHING!!! IT'S GONNA BE A ROUGH RIDE!!!</strong>" And they pierced directly into the vortex therefore.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were still following them towards the vortex, but their hull was getting weak as they draw nearer, with beeping sounds warning them of overstressing the hull. Just then, one beam rubbed against Ghondor's ship. She managed to dodge rolling to the left on time. Noah: "<strong>GHONDOR!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's just a scratch. Keep goin'! Mind your own ship, dag!"</p>
<p>"Urgh!!!"</p>
<p>Riku reported, "Distance to vortex rim, 300 and falling! Powering shields to max!" And a green frequency shield rolled around the ship. "Noah! <strong>When punch through, open throttle to full!</strong> We climb up flow in one big swell!"</p>
<p>"<strong>ROGER THAT!!!</strong>" And he gritted his teeth and pushed forward. The rocket engine, or perhaps with the help of the tornado's wind, pushed them upwards, getting them on to the surface of the tornado. Against the storm where hail brushed through, electrical sparks strike, and beams flying around, Noah bent forward, putting his whole weight on the throttle, gritting his teeth.{{footnote: In real life, the design of the throttle will not be up in this case, but down, so gravity can help, and there would be a lock to lock it at max position than having to push it yourself, wishing it doesn't bounce back.}} "Yaaargh, urggggg..." The engines pushed and pushed and overclocked, blasting from purple flames to blue flames, providing extra thrust. "Kh... We can't... take much more!"</p>
<p>Ghondor urged, "<strong>Get in, Ouroboros!</strong>" Nope, their hope cannot lose. They are already here, they must push through.</p>
<p>The ship originally had its nose directed into the vortex while they were going upwards; but realizing they can't, they tilt it so the belly parallel the tornado surface, zooming upwards. After escaping the top of the tornado, the ship, like a rocket, temporarily floated on mid-air. Their engine dies off, inertia was slowly taking hold. "Over there... The center!" The ship rolled to its right. "Riku! Deploy the ram!"</p>
<p>"Riku on it!" He pressed a button, and a glowing pointed object stuck out from below the nose of the ship to become the new nose of the ship. With gravity and game maker director's will, their roll aimed 'perfectly' at Origin's center. Two of the six engines were throttled to full speed.</p>
<p>"<strong>We've got a clear shot! Here goes!</strong>" The central wasn't metallic, but a hole which they can enter. However, because it has layers, each separated by a bulging ring, each rotating opposite of the next{{footnote: So when one rotate clockwise, the next will be anticlockwise, the next then clockwise, and so on.}}. The ship does not slid through perfectly, instead bounced along the walls and jumped here and there as they penetrate deeper. The ram destroyed the bulging rings whenever they hit. The others gritted their teeth as they withstood impacts.</p>
<p>At the end of the layers of giant generator the shape of a donut, but having sinusoidal wave at its surface. On the peak of each wave were a tube filled with blindingly red liquid. The ship pierced from the side of the generator and exit on the other side. Short circuited, it immediately sparkles electricity; exploded as the ship exited the structure, and all its red lights turned off.</p>
<p>By now, the ship had lost all its kinetic energy, floating mid-air just after exiting the generator. Gravity took over and it fell down, crashing into the pool of water below, before floating slowly to the edge on the opposite side.</p>
<p>They had arrived at their destination. Origin.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile outside, shots continued as the Ouroboros were having fun inside. Their success immediately reflected as tornado faded, shots stopped. Ghondor and the others were watching in their ship the giant rotating disc that appeared before their eyes. When the tornado cleared mostly, she beamed the image to the group inside Origin.</p>
<p>Watching from inside their ship, Taion: "Origin..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Almost like a Ferronis, huh?"</p>
<p>The group were standing up, preparing for land battle. Mio announced, "The original Ferronis..."</p>
<p>Noah was surprised, turning around with Riku, "This one's the first?"</p>
<p>"Not just first... I think <strong>all</strong> Ferronises... derived from this one right here."</p>
<p>The group got out of the ship, now that it's parked alongside the land, and observed at its interior. There were a lot of fortress-like structure just in front of them, with very thick black fog.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> Purple light beams shone up like those used in holograms. The high-tech industrial-like structure inside the giant room, with some platforms and several storey tall buildings, occupy all spaces. Some generators sparkle electric from their central core. And there were unnamed creatures burning purple flames guarding the area. This, is <strong>Origin.</strong> A forever dark, gloomy, purple-reddish sky loomed over the area.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>Lanz: "Whoa... So this is what it's like on the inside... It's all just... machines, and more machines..." Sena bent down to touch the floor.</p>
<p>Taion observed, "I also see... trace amounts of the black fog."</p>
<p>Sena: "Hey, this metal... It's like Noah's sword!" Noah then bent down to feel it.</p>
<p>"You're right. It is the same."</p>
<p>Eunie questioned, "Mio, you know what's in here?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, no. Whenever we teleported, it was always to a large, dim room. I think that was Z's doing, to keep the location secret."</p>
<p>"<em>Welllll... Guess we're searching the old-fashioned way, then.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "What about the other Moebius? Anything?"</p>
<p>"About that..." She looked up, trying to access her memory. "It's odd... It's like they're right here beside me, but also far away. I feel like I'm surrounded by them on all sides."</p>
<p>Lanz reasoned, "<em>Well... This is the enemy base and all. Kinda makes sense.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Or maybe...</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>She hypothesized, "This whole place... floor, walls, and ceiling... <strong>Everything here could be Moebius</strong>." And the whole group gasped, surprised by such notion. An inanimate Moebius, huh? Or the Origin had been Moebius-ed.</p>
<p>Noah's sword was oscillating strongly. Taion, noticing such movement, questioned, "Is it them?"</p>
<p>"No... The transmission pattern's different. <em>This feeling</em>... It's like it's calling to us."</p>
<p>Sena asked, "You think it's... the Kevesi Queen?"</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Mio: "Where, then? Can you tell?" And he drew out Lucky Seven, pointing it around him to find a direction.</p>
<p>The strongest vibration was "Below."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Do we go, Noah?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Let's go. It's <strong>all</strong> been leading to this." And so their new direction had been set.</p>
<hr />
<p>Destroying some monsters that lurk the Origin floor, and it fell into ashes, the group sheathed their blades, and Eunie exclaimed, "<strong>What the spark were those things?! They fall apart the moment we take 'em down!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena noted that "the black fog is gone too..."</p>
<p>Taion stated his observation, "They're not mechanical... But neither are they biological."</p>
<p>Noah noted that she was thinking hard, asked, "Something wrong, Mio?"</p>
<p>"Mm... As they fell, I could feel it, very slightly... A vague whiff of Moebius{{footnote: So the word 'Moebius' here had the <em>term</em> of not a person, but a feeling. To understand the meaning of 'term', read <em>How to Read a Book</em> by Mortimer Adler.}} coming off them."</p>
<p>Eunie folded her arms, "Those things? What's that mean?"</p>
<p>She shook her head, "I'm not sure..."</p>
<p>Noah reminded, "Mio, didn't you say before, all this could be Moebius?"</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<p>Taion asked, "Are you trying to say those things might be Moebius as well?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "But they don't even look human."</p>
<p>"I think the shape might not matter so much."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"<em>I think I'm starting to get the picture.</em>" He closed his eyes, "I feel like I know what Moebius{{footnote: Another different term that don't mean the 'Consul', but something else... that includes these abhorrent creatures...}} is..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the cinema room. N was still in the desolated state. Z stood in front of him, trying to call him back for one more time. "You, who wield the Sword of the End. The endless now, is under <em>threat</em> of being <em>cut short</em>." That doesn't matter anymore. His Mio is gone. Who had he to share the endless now with, if she's gone forever? "Could you do <em>it, I wonder?</em> <strong>Could you slay the ones</strong> <em>who advance relentlessly toward despair? You do after all desire eternity... Above. All. Others.</em>" Nope, still looking on the ground. He could not do it, not after Mio is gone. "<em>Now. Take it in your hand.</em> <strong>For the endless</strong> <em>now</em>. <strong>For that which you so</strong> <em>desire</em>."</p>
<p>Perhaps being mind controlled, he tilted his head up, stood up slowly, and pulled the Sword that looked just exactly like Lucky Seven that had been pierced onto the floor in front of where he'd just stood up from. He raised it in front of him, looked at it attentively without emotions, and his eyes glowed Moebius.</p>
<hr />
<p>They arrived at a place which was shielded by an array of doors. Door after door, back to back, they opened. Dust started rising to ankle high, for no one had set foot here for a long while. Nevertheless, forget about the dust. They will set foot once more after such long time.</p>
<p>Inside the giant chamber was brightly lit purple. Noah: "<strong>Over there!</strong>" And he quickly dashed towards the center, which was a purple core with spikes, each having a metal chain 360° that held something, or perhaps, someone, dangling in the middle, in mid-air. Came up close, the group can see clearly: it's the Queen. Melia Antiqua. Chains wrapped around her waist, hands, and neck. Her eyes were shut, unable to wake. She was hung a few meters above them.</p>
<p>"<em>Man, that's our Queen, Melia.</em>" said Lanz.</p>
<p>Mio felt hurt, "That's vile... How could they do this to her?"</p>
<p>Taion: "With all we've seen of Moebius... I'd put nothing past them."</p>
<p>Sena: "We have to release her!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah!"</p>
<p>As he put his hand on Lucky Seven's hilt, ready to slice such chains into pieces, N's words reverberated softly, as if directly into their ears, "<em>Took you long enough...</em>"</p>
<p>"I know that voice... It's N." And he gave up pulling the sword before solving their enemies. They looked to the left -- he was entering the room and finally stood between them and the Queen. The darkness and dullness in his eyes betrayed all hope. He had no more hope. "<em>Huh</em>... You look unwell. Like me..." He rethe depressed state he was in when he was locked away by him. "When you had us locked up."</p>
<p>"Hmph... Got my just deserts? <em>Well don't you look smug, with my woman on your arm,... Noah</em>."</p>
<p>"Does this face really look smug to you?"</p>
<p>"What else would you call it, huh?"</p>
<p>Mio: "N..." He hadn't changed his mind, in serious denial.</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Poor clod.</em> You don't understand anything..."</p>
<p>Doesn't matter. But "You cannot have <em>the Queen.</em> She is the fulcrum of <em>Origin itself</em>. By my very existence, <em>I will keep her from you</em>."</p>
<p>Lanz retorted immediately, "<strong>Well that's not gonna happen. Our schedule's tight enough as is.</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie was still angry with him, "And also, this is <em>our</em> Queen you're talking about! <strong>So get ready for a right royal thrashing!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "You're effectively a part of Noah himself. We'd reeeeaaallly rather not hurt you."</p>
<p>Sena: "But we will if we have to. 'Cause if you get in our way, then Moebius or not, we're throwing out all the stops <strong>and then some!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hmph... Don't fool yourself. Willpower alone won't change the world." And he started drawing immense dark energy into his sword as he got into his preparing stance.</p>
<p>Noah: "We'll prove you wrong. you'll see. Watch."</p>
<p>"You cannot hope to win. Not while I stand here, at the brink of the void."</p>
<p>"Void..."</p>
<p>"<em>Hm?</em>"</p>
<p>"That's just... <strong><em>your grief.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"It's called sadness, N."</p>
<p>"Hmph..."</p>
<p>"We came here... for you. <strong>To honor M's wishes.</strong> And to rescue <strong>you from your sorrow!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>To rescue me...?</em> What meaning does that tripe hold for me? <strong>Now that</strong> all is past, <strong>why should</strong> it matter?" And there was a pause as they looked at each other, he looking at him with sad eyes, and him looking as if they're the ones that know nothing. "If you don't know, then let me teach you. <strong>I'll drag</strong> <em>you with me...</em> <strong>Deep into the void! To the depths of DESPAIR!</strong>" And the group drew their weapons, ready for battle.</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway through the battle. Noah: "I'll ask again... <em>Why did you do it?</em> <strong>TELL ME!!!</strong> How could you <strong>murder</strong> the <strong>City's people?</strong> Just think... <strong>They were the lives of your OWN KIN!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>My own kin...? You're wrong. They were nothing but mere chaff.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What?!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"They were superfluous for us Moebius living in the now. <strong>Furthermore! All those lives wouldn't have EXISTED without me!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Ngrh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>As their original</strong> creator, <strong>I held dominion over their lives and deaths!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Listen to yourself!</strong> Tell me... What about M, then...? What about the love <strong>'Mio'</strong> had for them?!"</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...!</em> <strong>Mio! MIO! MIO!!!</strong>" With each shout his crease on his eyes deepened, and he pointed his sword on Noah's neck, the desperation in his voice, "<strong>You are the ones who couldn't protect her! In the end you were powerless!</strong> <em>And now she's</em> <strong>gone...!</strong> <em>How could you?!</em> <strong>ANSWER ME!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You really don't know? Don't you understand anything? <strong>I don't get it! Why, N...</strong> Why do you keep <strong>punishing yourself like this?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hrrr hrrrrgh..."</p>
<p>Dropping his head as he speak, "<em>You took the wrong path,</em> <strong>and then</strong> <em>you had to walk it alone... You just messed up...</em> You messed up royally!" There were two paths he could chose in the past.</p>
<p>"Hrrrghhh..."</p>
<p>"<strong><em>Regret owns you...</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"What do you know...?"</p>
<p>"'If only I'd make the right choice...'; 'If what happened, hadn't...' Clinging to the past, <strong>obsessively</strong>... You just had to keep walking that path. <strong><em>What you've become... is 'regret' itself!</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Really. And what <em>does that make you, then...?</em>"</p>
<p>"I am... All of us... We're hope."</p>
<p>And he raised his eyebrow, "They're hope, <em>he says...</em> <strong>Ha-hah!</strong> What lofty heights of arrogance.{{footnote: Shaking his head.}} Like some self-proclaimed <strong>savior</strong>?"</p>
<p>Mio joined in, "Not at all. They're the words of the one you held most dear."</p>
<p>His voice shaky, "Huh?!" Mio in bed looking at her newborn, they recalled. And she looked at him, sad at his current state. But he, he... he was flabbergasted.</p>
<p>"That's her... <em>inside there?</em>" Fragile voices.</p>
<p>Noah: "She felt regret... Just like you did." Or she wouldn't have stood by the cliff one night, thinking of jumping off and hopefully end her life. "And yet, she had hopes for the future. That's why she left everything to Mio." Her smile, on the day of the eclipse. Her wishes does not{{footnote: does not evaporate with it.}}. And N continue to look at the teary-eyed Mio for long.</p>
<p>"This 'Hope' of yours... How can there be anything like it?!" It's too late. This is the path he'd walked, and he could no longer return. How could he? People say you could start exercising at any age, but do you believe such words? Maybe some of you, but not most. He shook his head, forcing his thoughts unwavering, "<strong>In this world, there is nothing but the void!</strong>" Putting his sword back into the scabbard to gather energy again, "<strong>Peer now into it, and watch your precious hope CRUMBLE to nothing!</strong>" It released a shockwave at the group and shook them back one step.</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm trying to tell you...! THAT'S JUST THE SADNESS, SPEAKING THROUGH YOU!!!</strong>" Another round between hope and depression commenced.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Urgggghhhhh...Irghhh hurggggghhh Ngggrrrhhhh" He dragged behind while he lost his sword, fell to the ground, too effete to stand up. His panting breathe cannot hide his desolation, his worthlessness.</p>
<p>While the group were still on their defense, Mio, looking at him full of sorry, sheathed her blade, dropped her guard. The rest were surprised at her actions. She nodded to Noah before walking towards him. The others sheathed their blade as they watched.</p>
<p>"<em>'I want to be with you forever'</em>... Those words back then were the truth. It's what she really wished for..." She bent forward to look at him closer. Recall herself in her cell, looking out at the moon, shedding tears.</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right... I wasn't... Hurggg... I wasn't mistaken. When I tried to give her <strong>eternity</strong>, that was the <strong>correct</strong>, choice... <strong>And you ruined it!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>BECAUSE YOU'VE CHANGED!!!</strong>" She immediately retorted.</p>
<p>"<strong>HURRRGGGGHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>You still don't understand? You were together so long... How can you not get it?! She wanted you to go back,</strong> back to the name <em>'Noah'</em>..." And his iris constricted, putting it so blandly in front of him his problem. With tears in her eyes, "<strong>She wanted you to call her...</strong> by the name <em>'Mio'</em>..."</p>
<p>"<em>Why?...</em> Why are you the ones, who get to stand there together? In this world, edge to <strong>bleeding</strong> edge filled with sorrow..."</p>
<p>Noah from behind walked up towards Mio, while speaking, "Perhaps... we just got lucky."</p>
<p>"'Got lucky'...?"</p>
<p>"Trace it to chance encounters."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh!!!</em>"</p>
<p>"I've met... so many people." Guernica, Ethel, Monica, Ghondor, Shania, Crys, "Lanz, Eunie, Taion, Sena, Riku, and Manana...{{footnote: The group walked up to stand beside them as he speak.}} My friends have been invaluable. <em>And of course</em>," and he turned to look at the one he most cherished, "I met Mio, too... <em>There's a very small difference, between you, and me.</em> If I had been in your shoes, I'm sure I would have <em>chosen the same.</em>"</p>
<p>As if hope came back, or maybe, reassurement, "<em>You would, would you...?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah... But not any more. Mio and my friends... and not just them,... but the other Mio, and the other me... Every person I have met, has <strong>shaped</strong> me and <strong>changed</strong> who I am. Thanks to them, I can <strong>choose</strong> the future."</p>
<p>"Hurggg... Even if you do succeed at returning the world to its original form, there's no guarantee you'll live long enough to enjoy it. <em>What about that? Do you still intend to persist regardless...?</em>"</p>
<p>Without a moment hesitation, "Yeah, we will. We'll fight our way out <em>of these ten years.</em> That's all."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>Mio took a step forward, bent forward again to look at him attentively, "N... You were just like us once, <em>an Ouroboros</em>, fighting for the future. But one day, you gave up on it, and made the choice to protect the 'now'. But you know, that's OK too!" She put her fist on her heart and appreciated, "<strong><em>To protect, and to endure... They're shapes a wish can take.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hngggh...</em>"</p>
<p>"And I, I knew exactly what that meant." He looked at her, as if he saw his Mio once again overlapping with her.</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah walked near him, held out his hand to invite, "Won't you come with us? You could try... to move forwards again."</p>
<p>"<em>After so long...?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's what you both wanted, right?</em> Well then, easy choice."</p>
<p>"<em>Haaaarggghhh...</em>" With trembling hands, he slowly held out and touched Noah. Upon contact, a bright glowing light shone, illuminating the room bright, and brought up Noah's Ouroboros symbol and N's Moebius's symbol. With smile on N's face and surprise on Noah's, N brought them back to where the road situation had lead before.</p>
<p>By the evening sun, grass to both sides of the road, trees beyond the boundaries, and sun at infinity, there were no longer two path to choose; only one... to keep walking the one under your feet, until you succeed. As if standing behind the cinema screen, N took a step into the cinema and walked down that single road, never looking back. There's no Mio waiting at the edge to walk with him, but he will walk on nevertheless.</p>
<p>The bright light blinded the space and Noah was inside his thought. As N merged with him, he gained the half-Moebius-half-Ouroboros symbol.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back in the room, wind blew through, leaving no trace of N's existence.</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>What in the...?</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>He vanished...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "What exactly does this mean...? Noah?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Is he... dead, or what?"</p>
<p>Still holding out his hand, he looked at where he touched him in his palm. Slowly grabbing it into a fist, he replied, "No... He's fine."</p>
<p>Taion: "Fine in what sense?"</p>
<p>He looked at Mio, and she nodded to him, he nodded back, but didn't explain to the others. Perhaps she knew something about it, though her situation is somewhat different, but she also gained the half-Moebius before. "For now, let's do what we came for." And he lead the group towards Queen Melia.</p>
<p>Sparkles like glitters shook off from her shirt. The group looked as she was being lowered to the floor, the chains gone without them doing anything to it, but her eyes still closed until she touched the ground. She slowly regained her feet and opened back her eyes, as the others were astonished. "<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I had... a long dream.{{footnote: Nice one, Melia! Your first sentence after so long is very conclusive!}} A very, very long dream.</em> In my dream, youths were fighting. And as many times as they fell, <em>they always got back up again.</em> A dream of young people, simply trying to survive..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Majesty..."</p>
<p>"Noah... <em>correct</em>?" And he nodded in affirmation. "I have been watching you,... all this time, through the eyes of my simulacrum... <em>Well done making it here.</em>"</p>
<p>"The Queen of Agnus is already free. Now you are too. And now... <em>that leaves only <strong>him</strong>.</em>"</p>
<p>"You mean... Z?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"About Z... He is not a person, but a concept."</p>
<p>"Concept?"</p>
<p>"Everyone can feel uncertain,... frightened... These feelings, coagulated, and then given human form, are Z. Unlike those people who were granted a Moebius body, he is a true, Moebius."</p>
<p>"Sounds ominous..."</p>
<p>Taion: "So he's not even <em>an individual</em>?"</p>
<p>"He is and he isn't. There is some Moebius within you, too. But... <em>perhaps you've realized that?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmph...</em>" Who says not when N and M materialized? When Crys materialized? When Joran materialized?</p>
<p>"Your Aionios... lies in frozen time... born from the Moebius wish that chose the endless now."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>So then, both <strong>us</strong>, and the world... Everything that exists, it's all false?</em>"</p>
<p>She shook her head, "Everything that exists is reality... Present lives... and future ones..." And they recalled the drop of moments to moments up till now, the experiences, the adventures, the people, the knowledge, the idea, the concepts, the emotions... Looking at the Core where she was enchained, "Moebius aside, the wills of countless people persist, inside of Origin." Turning to Noah, "The Sword of the End you carry, and Ouroboros, they take their shape from these thoughts. Protect the now, or carve a path <em>to the future?</em> The wielder decides."</p>
<p>The others look at him, and he looked down at his sword.</p>
<p>Melia continued, "The future is undeniable, <em>but you must realize your own.</em> I've seen what you've done. <em>You can do this, too.</em>" She then scanned the group, and after that, nodded, "Very well. There remains but one more thing I have to say to you. Noah. Mio. Lanz. Sena. Taion. Eunie." As she called out names, each "huh" or "hooo" escaped as they felt entitled. "<strong><em>This world... is yours.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Then she went on to guide them, "Further below this point, lies the nucleus of Origin. You will find Z there. I shall return to the Castle, and free the soldiers from the Flame Clock's bondage. Otherwise, their lives will only feed Z's power."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Nice thinking, Your Majesty! Countin' on ya!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Oh, uh, will you need an escort...?"{{footnote: Urmmm... You want to be the escort, Sena?}}</p>
<p>"I would think not. Might you have forgotten who I am?" And she summoned her blade, the staff, held it up high into the air which released some turquoise lights, and the green covered the surface of her. As she was doing that and others were attracted to her staff, she turned to look at Riku, whom suddenly turned a happy face at her and nodded, and she nodded back. Immediately, the green covered her blindingly and she teleported away.{{footnote: So not only the Moebius can teleport, she can too... Or maybe, the teleportation power the Moebius got came from her?}}</p>
<p>Lanz: "Whoa... Awesome!"</p>
<p>Noah walked forward and turned around to face the group, ready to give the next step, the next direction, "All right. This will be the last battle. We're all gonna make it through this, <strong>I promise!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Yeah! This new world</strong>, sounds like a blast."</p>
<p>Sena: "There's no way we can lose!"</p>
<p>Mio: "We're strong now. Just look how far we've come together."</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>The world is in our hands.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Right. Let's grab it, and hold tight!</strong>"</p>
<p>Both Manana and Riku nodded. And Noah nodded to all of them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside. It was already evening; the sun was setting red on the horizon.{{footnote: From second video. Anyway; not important detail to fumble over.}} Ferronises and Levnises of Agnians and Kevesis fired their beams and cannons at Origin. Monica, inside the control room still, watched 6 (3x2 column x row) tiny frames in front of the screen from different angles, "What a sight, the worlds fighting together. If you'd told me I'd live to see it, I'd have never believed it. Hehehehe... <strong>The time has come for the City to mobilize! Keves, Agnus - support them all! Gilgamesh, deploy!</strong>"</p>
<p>And the City started moving. It, in its usual fighter jet form, dropped off from the underneath of the rock it had clung to and nosedived into the water below. Then, it turned a few rounds, blasted its rockets, and stretched its wings as it swooshed and zoomed upwards into the sky beyond the waterfall that hid them.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Ghondor" She heard her mom on the round mirror like screen, and she showed herself as a portrait in her mom's ship.</p>
<p>"What is it now? And can you not use that name?"</p>
<p>As usual, she ignored her complaints, "We're ready to launch a full offensive on Origin. Back us up!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Mother, dear...</strong> Like I wasn't gonna do that anyway!" And the fleet joined in beside Gilgamesh.{{footnote: God knows if that was her fleet or not.If yes, how did she teleported from far away in Origin back to the City so fast; and why not just waited there near Origin? Or maybe Gilgamesh had already neared Origin before Monica called her?}}</p>
<p>"<strong>Our main goal is</strong> ultimately defense. <strong>Only destroy</strong> weapons on the outer rim. <strong>Noah and the others are</strong> heading for the core. <strong>Leave the middle</strong> intact."</p>
<p>"Screw that up, and we can't restore the world, right? <strong>Roger, Wilco!</strong>" And the fleet advanced first towards Origin while Gilgamesh followed behind.</p>

<p>Red lights similar to the ones that blinked on the cinema screen when Z found out they were coming, each shaping like a jellyfish, started to come online, one by one; there were five of them. Two doors opened, and the creatures shaped like insects swarmed into the room, each flaming purple flames on their metallic body. The legion marching towards the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>After killing some of them, which dismantled and fell onto the ground when they died, leaving only the metallic parts of their corpses behind, the group waited as there were no more "spiders" in front of them. But they felt the ground shaking as round 2 came out from behind the doors. Lanz: "<strong>Sparks' sake, there's no end to 'em!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well we are in the wringer here..."</p>
<p>Taion: "I had accounted for this, but these <strong>numbers...</strong>" The spiders did not stop marching while they were chatting and waiting.</p>
<p>Noah: "I know. <strong>But it's the only way!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Right. The core shouldn't be too far now!"</p>
<p>Sena: "C'mon, hang in there!"</p>
<p>While they were waiting for the clash, suddenly, something blasted in from outside that hits the first line of the spiders. "<strong>HUH!!!</strong>" Noah was shocked at such interception. As the dust cleared out, there was a giant engine-like structure that blocked between the group and the spiders. The door on the group's side opened like a slide, and Monica walked down:</p>
<p>"Oh good, looks like we managed not to hit you."</p>
<p>"<strong>Monica!</strong>"</p>
<p>"We've been trying to aim for the highest energy signatures. Score one for us."</p>
<p>"<strong>Good call!</strong>" And then, with the ground shaking, they watched the ship, with its door docked back, pulled back out with Monica still on the ground. She turned to nod at the ship, surely they were looking at her from the control room inside. Gilgamesh therefore transformed and flew away. "<strong>You're not going back?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hm? Well, y'know... I got curious, and wanted to see the face of our <em>real</em> enemy with my own eyes, so... Here I am."</p>
<p>As she finished her words, there was the sound of some ship floating in from the cavity carved out by Gilgamesh. Surprised, she turned around and watched who's here. The giant Lost Numbers Levnis dropped as Ghondor came out of it, "I thought I'd drop by, since the attacks wouldn't let up... And what do I see but you dags having a picnic."</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Ghondor!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"The Queen?"</p>
<p>Noah: "We got her out safely. It's just us, and Z... Our real enemy, finally."</p>
<p>"Right on. Then, you won't mind a little company."</p>
<p>Sena: "What are you coming for?"</p>
<p>"'What for'? Well, y'know... The head honcho's biggin' it up in there, ain't he? I got curious. Gotta see the big bad with my own eyes, right?"</p>
<p>The group looked at her, then at Monica, then at her, then snuffed their laughters... "Huh? You wanna clue me in on the joke?" Monica just shook her head.</p>
<p>Noah, still trying to control his laughter, "Sorry! Déjà vu... Or something like that."</p>
<p>"Huuuuh?" She was blank.</p>
<p>"Thank you. <em>Thanks to you</em>, now I can say definitively, there are things in this world..." He held out his fist, and continued, "we <em>must</em> protect." Monica and Ghondor held out their fist too, though not touching, just air punches.</p>
<hr />
<p>As the group continued traversing, X teleported near them. "Huh... Look at all you ravages, scurrying out of the woodwork. You've got some guts, Ouroboros!" She was not wearing her helmet.</p>
<p>Eunie: "X..." and the group got defensive.</p>
<p>Then, she transformed into her Moebius form, like an insect with a Batman-like 'wing' on her back, some chains that tie around her legs and her chest, and a ring floating on top of her head. "You want Z, right? Well you can't have him."</p>
<p>"You still think you're calling the shots here? I'll prove you wrong. Once and for all."</p>
<hr />
<p>Standing before the final entrance was Y, in his Moebius form. There was a moment of pause between Mio and Y when Mio called, "<em>Y...</em>" She initiated the dash while the group followed behind, got near him.</p>
<p>"Warm welcomes to you, Ouroboros! Long, <em>have I waited.</em>"</p>
<p>"Mimi..." Mio nodded back to her, say,</p>
<p>"We'll end it here."</p>
<p>"Well then. <strong>Let us verify the truth</strong> of this."</p>
<hr />
<p>Approaching the final entrance between them and the cinema room, the group stopped as Noah told the group, "Z's waiting for us beyond here. "</p>
<p>Lanz: "Finally, we can wallop some sense into him." The group felt excited.</p>
<p>He warned, "There's no turning back once we proceed past this point.{{footnote: Meaning, you can't even save the game halfway after you go through the door. If you fail, or if electricity to your Nintendo Switch or PC (if using emulator) was suddenly cut off, you'll have to restart from this point. And dang, this is very painful, esp. when one was young, one could only play Xenoblade 1 for half an hour a day, but the final chapter lasted for more than an hour, so one had to beg one's parents to extend the time, rationalizing it as 'cinematic' than 'gaming'.}} Are we all ready?"</p>
<p>Mio urged, "Come on. Let's go."</p>
<hr />
<p>The door to the room creaked open. The group was waiting for any imminent danger exiting. Nothing happened. Noah and Mio looked at each other, nodded to each other, and took the initiative to lead them into the room.</p>
<hr />
<p>Meanwhile, outside, Colony 4. Someone was watching the war from his/her iris. It was Bolearis. The Agnians and Kevesis of other colonies had joined the fight long ago while they were still here. He turned around and shouted, "<strong>Come on now, you lot! It's time for Colony 4 to SHOW off its fangs! So what're you loafin' around for?! GET your arses in gear!</strong>"</p>
<p>Up there, one of the Kevesi with wing was checking the engine or something, some green-glowing mechanics, turned around and stutteredly apologized, "S-s-sorry boss! It's just, th-he engine's conked out and won't start!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oi, then KICK the mudder till it DOES! YOU GOTTA BE FIRM! REAAAALLLY GiVE IT some elbow grease here!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Sir, that's insane!</strong> T-this is a delicate instrument!"</p>
<p>"Delicate, <strong>MY ARSE!!!</strong>" And he got to the engine below where the guy was complaining{{footnote: the guy was at a maintenance floor at floor 1, while he at ground floor.}}, showed how to do the job by kicking it hard himself, "<strong>WHACK IT! SMACK IT! SHOW IT WHO'S SPARKING BOSS!</strong>" The others just watched him doing the job.</p>
<p>The guy calmly explained, "I'm telling you, you can't just kick it and..." Then, the engine cranked and brrrrr and he was startled.</p>
<p>Borealis was satisfied, "Well lookee here, guess I'm the boss!"</p>
<p>"...Is this a joke?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Alllll right! Now we can</strong> come out swingin'! <strong>WHO'S WITH ME?!</strong>"</p>
<p>In unison, "<strong>YEAH!!</strong>"</p>
<p>At the top of the Ferronis, Borealis gave a speech: "We owe our lives to 'em. Now's the time to show 'em how <strong>we</strong> shine! <strong>C'mon, full throttle! Can't let the other colonies steal our THUNDER now!</strong>" And the Levnises opened the rights of way in front, the Ferronis rolled behind, proceeding to their vantage point.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group walked into the room. The various voices reverberated inside the room, but they were oblivious to it. Above them is the projector, the light that cast from its openings visible to us. Noah asked, "Where... are we?"</p>
<p>Inside the theatre, the cinema were playing the various scenes of their past. Seated at the front row was the shadow of "Z..."</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>Hrrr...</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "We found him... at last."</p>
<p>"How many times is it <em>now... that I...</em> and you... have confronted each other here <em>like this...?</em>" As he finished, he turned around to look at the group. "<strong>Yes, you're welcome to come on up.</strong> How many <em>incarnations?</em> <strong>How many</strong> ascents into the <em>spotlight?</em>" And he opened up his arms, the cinema still showed the various histories of every generation of Ouroboros. The group allowed themselves to approach him, Noah taking the lead.</p>
<p>Z waited until Noah had got near him and stopped at a comfortable distance, "And <em>once again, I shall endeavor to ask this of you... Tell me... why not resign yourself to the flow?</em>"</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate... Sounds like my memory isn't all that."</p>
<p>"<strong>You</strong> have come to stop the flow, <em>have you not?</em> This march of time, <strong>stilled</strong>, <em>for eternity</em>. You intend, to <strong>stop it</strong> by <em>removing me.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz questioned, "So is it flowing, or is it stopped? You're not making any sense, mate."</p>
<p>Eunie concluded, "<strong>Basically</strong>, if we can take you down, the world kicks up again. At least, that's what I'm picking up from all that."</p>
<p>"Human desires can be... <em>much likened</em>, to a river, flowing. All. Humanity <em>years for it, the endless now. That is why I'm here, you'll find.</em> My existence alone... It is proof and <em>evidence</em>."</p>
<p>Taion: "Cut the crap. <strong>Who in the world would possibly wish for this? I refuse to be controlled by you!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Although, thanks to the stunts you pulled, we managed to twig on to a whole lotta stuff. We learned how best to use the time we have. And for that, <em>you get a real good thanking.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah agreed, "You said it. <em>Though ten years is a mere glimpse, we now know the importance</em>... of <strong>true</strong> choice. <strong>We'll build it for ourselves. A world with the FREEDOM to choose!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>Not a hollow world of fiction like this one! Everyone wants a reality that they can believe in!</strong>{{footnote: Unfortunately, that's not true. Most people isn't dedicated to reality/truth in our world, preferred to hold on to outdated maps they build during their childhood, and go into serious denial when challenged. Even psychiatry or physiotherapy have low chance of changing them unless they can abandon their existing maps, if they have the courage to do so, which most don't.}}"</p>
<p>"Freedom- 'is' <em>nothing more than fiction</em>... A deception. Those with power, those who can choose think nothing of it. <strong>What then</strong> of those who <em>cannot choose?</em> What about the <em>meek</em> and <em>frail</em>? Not everyone is granted as many options, as <strong>you</strong> <em>all have</em>! Will you share? Give them some of yours? Will you call that charity? Or compassion? Will you show it? <strong>Imagining them</strong> who are granted it to be thus satisfied? <strong>Imagining not</strong> a piece of wretchedness to remain?"</p>
<p>The screen now displayed Joran and Shania, attracting Sena, Monica, and Ghondor's attention, as Z continued, "Making the best possible choices under duress. Living, the best, <em>life.</em> There are no losers in the world, I <em>offer</em>. With the turn of the <em>clock</em>, <strong>anyone</strong> can be a winner, <em>given the time</em>."</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>The only thing we ever do is take lives! There is no winning! You can't just invent some rule!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Why do you recoil from <em>taking lives?</em> The world itself has set this rule -- why... resist?" The screen changed to show taking of lives, and he continued, "It is through consumption of life that this world persists. <strong>Denying it</strong> is <em>self-delusion</em>. The only outcome, <em>self-destruction</em>. <strong>It is</strong> unequivocal <em>fact!</em> The imperative that is intrinsic to <strong>all living things!</strong>... The source of our power, and of all living things, <em>lies therein. Young</em>, spirited <em>people</em>, trading lives, aiming for new, <strong>even-loftier heights</strong> with <strong>each</strong> new day... That explosive motive power is something we <em>lack</em>." And he held his hands as if he grabbed something from thin air, "<em>The essence of life.</em> And we are here... <strong>to express ourselves</strong> as <strong>an EMBODIMENT of life!</strong>" And he held his arms wide as if to embrace.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Moebius filled the room, everyone teleported in, all seated on their seats, clapping.{{footnote These perhaps are unnamed Moebius, meaning they're not giving the alphabetical letters.}} The show is about the begin. The group and Z was already on stage. The group was defensive as they sensed they were surrounded by Moebius, whom their core lit the room purple dark.</p>
<p>Noah asked Z, "<strong>So that's it... That's what you're getting at...</strong> And just for that... <strong>you gave those two an impossible choice?!</strong>" The two roads where N can walk, with M waiting on one side. "<strong>IS THAT WHY YOU MADE JORAN AND CRYS INTO MOEBIUS?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Of course. As for the why...</em>" And he made a smile, "It's because it <em>amuses me.</em>"</p>
<p>"Ohhh..." Taion can felt a pang in his heart. The claps hadn't stopped all the while they were conversing.</p>
<p>Z continued, "The action-packed drama <em>of your lives</em>... We-are-its-foremost audience! <strong>Now then, play it out</strong> for me. <strong>What</strong> will the <strong>next</strong> <em>act</em> entail? Bereavement? Or revenge? <strong>A revolution,</strong> <em>perchance...</em> This world is <em>never boring...</em> Not while your lives, <strong>continue to make it so effervescent!</strong>" And the claps rang louder in the room.</p>
<p>Lanz, in a suppressed anger voice, "I'll end him...!"</p>
<p>Mio looked at him and listened, closed her eyes, said calmly, "I just got it."</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Huh?</em>" Got what?</p>
<p>"Fighting in order to live... The words Miyabi left me with... Now... This is exactly when they were for."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah... Mio's got it right. At first it was all fun and games. When we got Ouroboros powers, we were just like, happy to get to live a little longer. That was it."</p>
<p>Lanz: "But now, things are different."</p>
<p>Sena: "We learned that for many, there aren't any choices on the table at all. Because they were taken from them, by a bunch of crusty old mudders."</p>
<p>Taion: "The strength you talk <em>about</em>, is just all smoke and mirrors. <strong>Real</strong> strength <em>is different!</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "That's right. Knowing when to be close, and when to let go... Walking together, <strong>eventually choosing who you really are...</strong>" The group stand closer to Noah and Mio, more tightly packed. "<strong>That is strength. And THAT'S the real battle</strong> here... <strong>To find that answer!</strong>" He and Mio drew their blades therefore. The rest followed as he continued, "<strong>The WILL to choose our actions, MOMENT to moment. AND IF YOU DARE DENOUNCE THAT COMMON RIGHT, WE WILL DEFY YOU!!! TO LIVE IN A FUTURE... OVER WHICH YOU LAY NO CLAIM!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>And Z closed his eyes as he finished, jet himself up into the air, floating. The cinema screen stopped showing past memories, instead displayed a white screen (like "no signal" but without the wordings) which flickers.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>Stealing away your powers</strong> is trivial to me." And he enchained them, unable to use their Ouroboros powers, "<em>Now then, the curtain rises.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Let the stage of battle <strong>freeze your marrow!</strong>" With a flick of the finger, the group's agility was greatly slowed down.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Let the stage of battle scorch your flesh." Another flick of the finger, and flames burn the stage. They were suffering damage every second.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<em>I will face you as many times as you want</em>... The struggle is all that you are permitted." And he summoned an invincible shield in front of him; every attacks healed him than damaging him.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I've always known <em>just how gutless you creatures are</em>..." With the flick of the finger, the projector screen started showing past memories to kill their motivation,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Watch out!" And Joran pushed Lanz out of the place, put himself dead.</p>
<p>"Urg..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"That's the day, I've decided to have myself killed too!" She showed her Flame Clock in her eyes to the group.</p>
<p>Sena: "I just... I didn't want to believe that we were the same..."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>I'll live for him! For Joran! Live, AND KEEP MY FRIENDS ALIVE! THIS. I. SWEAR!!!</strong>" And he broke the shackles that prevented him from transforming to Ouroboros.</p>
<p>Sena: "I'm not going to imitate others ways of living anymore. I'm staying true to who I am. And that's the way it's going to be." And she too broke the shackles.</p>
<p>Together, they transformed into Ouroboros. But no use, the shield that changed damage into heal still was active. But with that Ouroboros attacked,</p>
<p>"Urggghhh hrrrrr" It managed to break Z's shield once. He bent down a bit as he suffered the damage, but quickly get back up composed. "Hmph. <em>Very good.</em> <strong>The first step</strong> in your so-called 'revolution'." He flew quickly between them before Lanz and Sena could react, and appeared behind them on air. The Moebius that were clapping below were no longer seen, perhaps because of the lights, or perhaps Z called them off. There on the air, he sucked the power from the endless now, the muted chatters of those who wished for the endless now drew into him. And for a moment later, the 'endless now' shield regenerated. Then, he flew back to where he was before, waiting for their next attack. "I shall observe carefully what you would term your strength."</p>
<p>With the flick of his finger, he started showing another piece of history on the cinema.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Eunie's past live, facing Moebius D. He played with her fear before killing her in her eyes.</p>
<hr />
<p>"I need you to live, Taion. <strong>You must! Flee for the colony!</strong>" And Nimue turned back to cut the enemy while Taion flowed with the secret river down.</p>
<p>"<strong>MAAM!!! NIMUE!!!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Who cares about the past? We aren't going to give up!</strong>" And she broke her shackles.</p>
<p>Taion: "I know what I have to do. <strong>I work</strong> to better myself. So I won't make the same mistake."</p>
<p>Together, they transformed into Ouroboros that does more healing for Z than attacks, attacking his shield. But it again overstressed the shield, broke the shield the second time. "Urrrgggh haaaa..." Again, he quickly regained composure. "Hah I see... <strong>You will grow strong enough</strong> to withstand adversity." Again, he swiftly flew between them into the air above the seats, absorbed more endless now power to regenerate yet another shield, then returned to his place. "Fleeting. Beings. <strong>What will you show me next?</strong> <em>Come now.</em> <strong>Entertain</strong> me."</p>
<p>With the flick of yet another finger, he showed another piece of history.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>M's final words before she died during the day of the Eclipse. "It's been fun, Noah."</p>
<p>"<em>Mio...</em>" And she disappeared before his eyes.</p>
<hr />
<p>And Miyabi sending her and Sena into the escape pod, leaving back herself. "Miyabi... <strong>MIYABIIIII!!!</strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Noah: "We've come this far harboring everyone's hopes and dreams... <em>and so</em>... we would <strong>never</strong> stop now. Not when we've come so far." And her shackles shattered.</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>We won't lose</strong> to you. <strong>We'll fight, for all the people alive. Their desires must build the bridge to the future!</strong>" And she broker hers.</p>
<p>In their Ouroboros form, their attack does some damage and a smaller healing value to Z. Looks like he cannot withstand so much anymore!</p>
<p>"<strong>Urgnh nghhh!!!</strong>" Once more, his shield was broken, regained his composure. "I can hardly believe that you're strength has grown <em>thus</em>... You would usurp me, <strong>grasp the future</strong>. I cannot ascent. The curtain, closes."</p>
<hr />
<p>"This, <strong>is all a sham!</strong>" Noah dashed towards Z with his Lucky Seven, stuck it at the stage, and broke the stage floor. Spider webs cracked the floor as Moebius power escaped from it. Z did nothing to prevent him. The spider web spreaded and grew to cover the whole cinema. The invisible Moebius that showed themselves still sitting down there disappears as they lost their source of power. Even Z cannot retain his human form anymore. He transformed into a cloud and start sucking all the escaping Moebius power towards him, forming an ominous enormous black-purple cloud where he previously stood. "Is this... Z's true form? Or... Origin's?!"</p>
<p>The cloud bear for a while before Z's head appeared out of the cloud, his hair stretches to the ground, acted like his legs. He only had a head, no lower body, entirely made of the cloud components, Moebius particles. At the back of his head is a ball of energy, the Moebius cloud. He asked, "Why do this...?"</p>
<p>"Huh...?"</p>
<p>"If you restart Origin, time in perpetuity will flow once more... The opposing worlds will overlap. What lies beyond, is oblivion... You ought to be aware of this... <em>Yet even knowing it, you advance toward the future...</em> <strong>Why?!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Why...? Hah. <strong>Let me turn it</strong> around for you. <strong>How can you</strong> be so sure?" He pointed his sword, the sheath now back covering Lucky Seven, at Z. "There <strong>should be a future where it doesn't happen!</strong>"</p>
<p>"No such thing exists. The present is all... The present is all we need... <strong>That, is our UNWIELDING WISH!!!</strong>"  And the group went on to battle Z's true form.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside, we see Origin starting to disintegrate its upper half. The shards were floating around as it got ejected, until a red core floated from the bottom part of Origin, attracted it back, and formed a bird-shaped structure attached to the bottom part, like a chick with its bottom stuck to the other half of the egg, half-hatched. Upon forming shapes, it grew some energy-made tentacles dangling from its wings. Guns powered by rockets (we'll call 'anchor rockets' because they shaped like an anchor) were ejected from under the wings. After a short startup, the guns pointed at all direction and began firing beam shots, wiping out lands, soldiers, Levnises, and Ferronises; even the waterfall got strike through, and the City shook as it took impact, the ceiling, in the form of boulders, came crashing down. Some people, maybe Lost Numbers, took initiative to redirect the crowds toward the only safe haven: the memorial hall.</p>
<hr />
<p>Queen Melia teleported back to the Castle. Tapping her staff once on the floor, it casted a giant turquoise ring that enlarged to include the Castle and its vicinity, disabling the Flame Clock of those soldiers that're still under control. Without waiting for them to realize what'd happened, she addressed to both the soldiers in the room, and via video call, to the rest of the soldiers not in the room, "Hear me, my loyal subjects. Starting imminently, we shall commence, a full attack on Origin. The battle is not a fabrication. <strong>It is a fight, to seize control</strong> of our lives! I need you now. Entrust your lives... to your rightful Queen, Melia Antiqua!"</p>
<p>"AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!" And they raised their fist to cheer for the fight. Then, they started running out of the room to prepare for battle. Melia raised the throne chair, with herself standing on it, pluck her staff into the hole that accepts it, turning it into a key that control the Castle. After the controls emerged, she raised the Castle from its original location and transformed it. The bottom "fat" part of the castle was floated to its back, and the folded arms, legs, and head hidden like the wheels of an aircraft were revealed. Then, six blades extended around the ring at the back, and she flew the Castle to the battlefield, leaving Gardin defense base behind where it was.</p>
<p>{{footnote: <a href="./91_melia.html">Learn more about Melia here.</a>}}</p>
<hr />
<p>A similar green ring extended from Agnus Castle, expanding outside its perimeter encroaching Erythia Sea, deactivating currently active Flame Clocks. Then, the invisible stage the fake Queen floated down from during the Eclipse revealed itself, slowly docking down. Melia stuck her blade, a sword, into the respecting hole. Electric sparkles behind her on that shield-like ring, and she gained control of the Castle, transforming it into a Machina. Addressing via video call to her soldiers, "Right now, inside Origin, there are people fighting against <strong>all</strong> odds, to create a future for us all. Those brave ones, they want to teach us the true meaning of life. For the future they dare to forge... Let us join the path that they showed us! Let us join the fight!" And Agnian Castle started floating towards Origin, leaving ripples over Erythia Sea.</p>
<p>{{footnote: <a href="./92_nia.html">Learn more about Nia here.</a> }}</p>
<hr />
<p>Lines of Ferronises and Levnises continued firing at Origin. Origin destroyed a lot of them, but more replaced those fallen. Even the two Castles had already arrived at the frontline, attacking. Colony 4 also arrived at its rendezvous point. Borealis, watching the ongoing fight, exclaimed, "Look at all those Colonies, fighting as one... Now- that- is- a- sight... If we can just come out on top today... <strong>Commander...</strong> We'll do it. We'll build it for you. <strong>A new world for every one of us!</strong>" With that complete, it fired the electrical power that once used to target the Ouroboros at Origin, and destroyed one of Origin's anchor cannon.</p>
<hr />
<p>As Origin deployed more anchor cannons to replaced those lost, the Agnian Castle sent a barrage of missiles that hit its hull. With that to distract, it charged the annihilation cannon, annihilating one of Origin's joint. On the other side, the Kevesi Castle launched two beams from its shoulder, flaming the other side of Origin. The tentacles now lies dormant, and its hull heavily in flames.</p>
<p>Inside her room, Melia was having a video chat, "It has been a while, Nia,... Queen of Agnus. I am in your debt, across the centuries."</p>
<p>"<em>Nonsense.</em> Don't mention it. I simply did what needed doing, and entrusted the rest to the right people."</p>
<p>"I see that you're still... affecting that elocution."</p>
<p>"Oh my, it befits me not?"</p>
<p>"Do not hide your stripes."</p>
<p>"Hm!" Here. Comes. Nia!!! "All right... <strong>Then let's thrash those goons, Melia!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Gladly! Together!"</p>
<p>The eyes of the Origin, consisted of a hundred eyes on the 180° visor, concentrated itself to look to its right. Locking on Kevesi Castle, it extended its tentacles that stuck itself into it. After suffering the shock, Melia said, "The will of young people, weaving a future... That is... the indispensable force that drives worlds forward." Outside, cannons had been concentrated and fired at the Castle, which it blocked with a frequency shield raised; the tentacles previously sticking to it were already gone.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on Nia's side, she summoned a diamond glowing atop the top of the Castle. As she continued to prepare the annihilation cannon, she did not forget to raise the auras, "I know just how scary taking the first step can be. And yet, it was young folks like that that set whole worlds in motion, overcoming their own fears." Origin, perhaps sensed the incoming annihilation, focused to it, targeting cannons to stop the annihilation from launching. Before it could launch, Gilgamesh flew in and destroyed those cannons. "In the hope, that the future will birth more such people..." and the cannon fired.</p>
<p>Origin lined some anchor cannons together to generate a stack of diamond shields. Upon colliding with the annihilation ball, it creates an annihilation so huge it swallows the right side of Origin. Seeing its effect, and while waiting for the cannon to recuperate, she fired another barrage of beams at Origin. The shield wasn't broken by the annihilation effect (or maybe it was re-raised), continued to shield and deflected most of the barrage, while some other gone from the side and hits the body (evading the shield and turning in).</p>
<p>Kevesi Castle watched till the end of the barrage, didn't even make a dent on the diamond shield, before moving itself closer. It clenched its right fist and punched Origin on the other side. No use, it only attracted the eyes to target on it, followed by an array of tentacles aiming for it, damaging it. Clusters of shards fell off it.</p>
<p>Inside the cinema room, some of the ceiling fell on to the ground, "Urgh", as the group tried to dodge the collapsing ceiling shards. Taion was shielding Eunie with his Mondo. Lanz raised his greatsword over his head to shield him and Sena. Noah stood beside Mio.</p>
<p>Z: "I am afraid I cannot allow you to proceed!" And Z's face changed into Noah's face. The outside attacks never stopped while he speaks. Tentacles strangled both Castles, tightened, and leaving them in flames. "This world must remain in the endless now!"</p>
<p>Noah: "...Now I get it. <strong>The true source</strong> of power, from which Moebius stems... And why they so desperately seek the 'endless now'..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Yes, I think I see it too. What the <strong>Queen</strong> said... There is some Moebius within us as well!" As he spoke, Z's face changed into his face, wearing glasses just like he did.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah... And it's our own selves." Now it changed to Eunie's face. "<strong><em>We're scared of ourselves, and... we lose track.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "We cut off our own way to the future!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "The possibilities!"</p>
<p>Mio: "In that case... There's only one thing we can do."</p>
<p>Noah: "To believe. In the path we've walked this far! <strong>AND IN THE FUTURE THAT LIES AHEAD!!!</strong>" And Z changed back to his own face. And so the fight commence. Round 2!</p>
<hr />
<p>"Hmm... Must we turn up the pressure?" And he gathered more Moebius power and transformed into a more powerful form of himself.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>HAHAHAH!!! RUN, RUN TO THE ENDS OF THE WORLD!!!</strong>" And he summoned some hole-like structure on the stage that dealt continual damage to the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Are your bonds true...? Allow me to assay..." And he transformed into a dark version with X's face. "Behold, the curtain rises once again... I hope you'll give us Moebius a good show!" Only the Kevesi were on this side. Mio and the other Agnians were nowhere to be seen.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside, the tentacles were still aiming at the Castles. Some, they dodged. Others hit. Melia, whom kept an eye on the Ouroboros, exclaimed, "Oh no! Noah and the others are trapped. I must hurry to their rescue!"</p>
<p>At the other side, the Agnian Castle blocked a myriad of tentacles by raising a frequency shield, and Nia shouted, "<strong>Get a load of this!</strong>" And she fired more beam barrage at the Origin. Meanwhile, the Kevesi Castle landed another punch on the Origin's face.</p>
<p>"Now is our chance! I am sending you <strong>reinforcements</strong>!... Everyone, lend Ouroboros your power! All is for the future connected!"</p>
<p>Those who joined Noah's team fighting X infinity were:{{footnote: Ignore some of the names that you don't know. And, <strong>these were randomly picked, so two videos you'll see different things.</strong>}}</p>

<p>On the other side, Mio and her group were fighting Z with Y's face, Y infinity:</p>

In battle, she had one of the best 'cheering' support, and in 'chain attack', she's capable of 'recharging one round of action', making your chain attack last for extra 2 rounds (the math says you should -1 every time, but instead, you +1, so +1 - (-1) = + 1 + 1 = 2)}}, an Agnian Commander wielding a flag: "I'll fight with you!"</p>

<hr />
<p>Y\(\infty\): "You dare defy my will also...?"</p>
<p>And Z could no longer retain separating them. He teleported all back on the central stage as Z recombined. "How long will you defy me...? <strong>Fine! If it's endless despair you wish for</strong>, I will grant it to you gladly!"</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside, the anchor cannons, detached from the tentacles and move via rocket engines, were tracking down Gilgamesh, exchanging shots while Gilgamesh was in evasion course. Travis was in control, "This'll take it down...!" And he used the wings of Gilgamesh to destroy the cannons.</p>
<p>Melia urged, gathering dual from the Castle's shoulder, "Press the attack, my people!"</p>
<p>Nia, gathering the annihilator, "<strong>Get out of the way! This ends here!</strong>" And both of them fired at the same time on the waist of Origin. And so it whiteout; the Origin could no longer battle. "<strong>Let's go an' help 'em, then! We'll grab the future with both hands</strong>, this time round!"</p>
<p>And so Melia joined the fight on the ground, teleporting in, "I have long awaited this moment... I too shall join the fight!"</p>
<p>Nia too, "<strong>Just a bit more! Give it everything!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>ARRRRRGGGGGGGHHHHHHH!!!</strong>" And he could no longer retain his face form. Black fog escaped from him strongly, so strong it blew into the group's face with thick black fog.</p>
<p>Taion: "<strong>Ngh... What power...! Crazy... T-this is the force of people's will?</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>You taking the mick?</strong> It's terrifying. Not knowing how tomorrow will turn out, how you will!"</p>
<p>Mio: "But still, you can't just hold it in place!" She took steps forward with great difficulty, like trying to walk inside a thick liquid, to find her balance from being blown away. Others too. "If you did that, you'd never change... You can't change the world like that!"</p>
<p>Noah: "That's why... I want to move on. <strong>We'll claim the future, and shape it ourselves!</strong>"</p>
<p>Z: "And when you cannot choose? What then? In that desperate moment, <strong>who will be there to soothe you?</strong>" And he blew more Noebius energy at them; they had to bent their back to defend against the 'strong current'.</p>
<p>"Urghhh" They were having difficult moments protecting their face from 'strong winds'.</p>
<p>"The self is all that exists!... As such, <strong>the only cure</strong> for despair is <strong>TOTAL OBLIVION!!! That is the face of the world! I hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it, hate it! This rotten world... I. LOATHE. IT!!!</strong>" And he transformed into a ball of energy as he lose the power to retain even his true form.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside where Colony 4 Ferronis was, Borealis was standing and watching when suddenly, a blinding purple light illuminated its vicinity. He and others looked aside and blocked the light with their palm. As the shooting from the Origin cannon continued, there was a blinding light at its core. The soldier beside Borealis asked in fear, "<strong>L-Lieutenant! What's that light?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"It's coming from inside Origin..." Their eyes had got used to the slightly dimmer light and they can now look at its source.  "No... The cries of Moebius? <strong>The sheer ferocity</strong> of it... Noah... Mio..."</p>
<p>Inside Origin, tremendous amount of Moebius energy released distorted even space and time. Z's face changed between the various Moebius, but he could no longer retain one single shape. The group watched as they were inside the center of conflict. Suddenly, Noah's and Mio's iris glowed the half Moebius symbol. "Huh!!!" Both of them put their hands to slightly cover that eye, as if in pain. In a bright light emanating from their Iris, N and M emerged from them like souls, and they floated towards Z, turning around to watch them for the final time before its time to go.</p>
<p>N and M looked at them with a faint smile, as if something pressing against their heart had been lifted. Noah: "<strong>N! M!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "So he... <em>didn't</em> disappear back then?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Nuh-uh. They were inside, with us! Think about it. They're still really the same people!"</p>
<p>N: "We were conceived from regret. <em>Sorry...</em>" The group watched as motes started rising from their soul. The "black hole" of Moebius Z was sucking stronger and stronger; they couldn't hold for too long. "Unlike you, who sprung forth from hope, regret is our be-all and end-all. 'If only we'd made the right choice...' 'If only things had been different...' "</p>
<p>M: "<strong><em>Blindly, we never tried to change ourselves, wishing only that the world would instead.</em></strong> We clung to the egotistical dream, of being together forever..."</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>But that's only natural! Anyone would wish for that! Nothing to be ashamed of!</strong>"</p>
<p>N looked towards M, and M: "Thank you." She looked back at N for a moment, and told Noah and Mio, "But now... our prolonged existence here, it only serves to strengthen those within this frozen moment in time, who would keep it thus."</p>
<p>N, looking at the 'black hole,' said, "So you see, we have but one choice here."</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>STOP IT, N!!! M!!! DON'T DO IT!!! WE'LL THINK OF A WAY TO DEAL WITH MOEBIUS!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>M: "What you see over there... It's not Z, or Moebius. But a single, intense desire. <strong><em>Your thoughts, they can never affect, a desire.</em></strong> But we, we who embody that very same desire..."</p>
<p>"<strong>YOU CAN JUST STAY HERE!!! PLEASE, STAY!!! WALK THIS WORLD WITH US!!! WE CAN WALK IT TOGETHER!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Noah's right! You've done enough! You don't have to do this!</strong>" And she held out her arms towards them, "<strong>You could finally be here together!</strong>"</p>
<p>N: "Such kindness... Your eyes, they brim with it... I ask myself... Were our eyes the same, on that day...?" And he recalled to the various reincarnations, days before final battle, days when Mio bear him a child... Together, they held their arms, fingers between fingers, slowly floating towards the 'black hole' as more motes evaporated from them.</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>N!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Noah, Mio... Though we came from different worlds, we were able to leave a life behind."</p>
<p>M: "It was a hope for the future. <strong><em>Our hearts and our dreams intertwined,</em></strong> and we were given the chance to weave new life. And therefore... It's all good." And they looked at each other, nodded, turned back to Noah and Mio.</p>
<p>N: "Believe in yourselves. All of you... will certainly reach... heights that we were unable to." And Noah and Mio held out one of their hands, trying to reach for the accelerating N and M. With bright light signifying the final stage of motification{{footnote: Turning into motes totally.}}, "You guys can surely... make it." And M rested her head on N's shoulders, to be together forever.</p>
<p>M: "You can take our place... in the future." And they turned into a firework-like object that aimed at the center of the 'black hole', strike it.</p>
<p>Moments later, "<strong>NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!</strong>" the cry of the desire exploded and blinded the vicinity once again, this time with a total whiteout.</p>

<p>Light blue sky sparingly filled with clouds, the group were standing on a piece of Elysium-like land{{footnote: Or perhaps, floating island?}}, paved with evergreen grass mixed with scattered maize-like grass, plus some bushes in the distance. On the sky ahead displayed two planets very close to each other. Behind them were some rocks and trees.</p>
<p>Noah now understood, "Z and the other Moebius... They wanted to protect the world too."</p>
<p>Taion: "That's why they created one they could control. I see where they were coming from."</p>
<p>Lanz: "That's something that... we feel almost every day."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Having to change... <strong><em>To continue to change, that's sparkin' scary.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "But... we can say this: <strong>Even</strong> if we are reborn later, right then, what we think and feel that moment is real. To sacrifice that is <em>never the right way.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>If you can't be true to yourself, then you're doing something wrong.</em>"</p>
<p>"Are you content? With your decision?" Melia and Nia approached from behind, questioned.</p>
<p>"<em>Haa...</em>"</p>
<p>Nia added, "Very soon, the stilled flow of time will restart. You can change your mind, if you act now."</p>
<p>Lanz immediately rebut, "Uh-uh-uh. You did <strong>not</strong> just tell us to become Moebius."</p>
<p>Eunie, teasingly laugh at it, "<em>Yeah, can you even imagine...?</em>" Then, seeing the leader whom was seriously not speaking of anything, looking at the distant worlds himself, she called out, "Uhhh, Noah?" Taion and the others were also looking up on him, waiting for his decision.</p>
<p>Melia: "Why are you wavering, Noah?"</p>
<p>"Some want to go on, and some want to stay... In this world, there are so many, mingled desires." He clenched his fist, getting overwhelmed by the clashing wish of the people. "But do we... Does anyone have the right to choose?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't you start minding us now." Ghondor appeared from nowhere and disturbed his chain of thoughts. They turned around and saw her standing beside Monica. "Just having the chance to be born in that world you make, that'll be plenty. So, you know... ya just gotta do it your way."</p>
<p>"Ghondor..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Uhhh</strong>... Though if I can..." And she looked at her mom, teasingly asked, "I might want a better name, eh!"</p>
<p>While they were busy 'quarreling' over a better name, Mio turned to him, "Noah, all of us here want the same thing. It's how the future should be."</p>
<p>"Yeah... You're right." And he held up his right palm to look at the back of his palm. The term mark no longer imprints on his palm; he can now live longer than a decade.</p>
<p>"The future is right there." He turned to look at Melia, whom continued, "Believe in the actions you've taken, in your friends, and above all, <strong><em>you should believe in yourselves.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>And he clenched his fist hard as he brought it up to his belly. "Well then... The answer's simple." Melia and Nia already knew what choices he'd make, the main reason and hope and faith that brought them here all along. They nodded to each other before giving them the space.</p>
<p>Noah and Mio turned to each other, agreed with each other, before having a last look at the stopped time in the horizon. He was no longer wavering, walked towards the edge as if trying to reach the two planets on the sky by himself while the others stood still and watched his actions.</p>
<p>In the whiteout that claimed the environment, we're back at the evening gloomy cloudy sky, where Origin stood. The core of Origin, the 6 red lights that was previously activated by Z that turned on the Origin's defense system and transformed it, now turned green. The group (and other groups) watched the changing color.</p>
<p>Something caught Mio's attention. She turned to her left; and others followed her glance. Agnus Castle just glided along. Turning to the other side, Kevesi Castle followed. They moved around the platform they stood; we're not sure of their final destination. They were happy at the final results, the world that they could return to the people.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a piercing bright light shone from atop that pricked their eyes while they were enjoying the scenery. Mio closed one of her eyes and raised her palm to block. Getting used to the new luminosity, she turned to look at it: the sun rays had shone through the gloomy cloud, scattering it,{{footnote: 光，会越过黑暗，打破一切恐惧我能，找到答案。}}, and brought with it hope on the land below.</p>
<hr />
<p>Standing atop the Kevesi Castle, Noah was on the balcony looking attentively at his sword, reminiscing the moments to moments that they shared since he summoned it, and the chain between them that even rebirthing could not break. The Ouroboros symbol on the Ricasso shone brightly.</p>
<p>"<strong>NOAH, C'MON! AIN'T GOT ALL DAY!</strong>" Lanz scratched his head as he appeared on the balcony, as the one to help him push through.</p>
<p>Disturbed from deep thoughts, he acknowledged after turning around, "Yeah, I know. Right with you!" And he decided to give him a little bit more time, waved back a 'sure', and leave the space and time for himself. He brought up the sword, gently touched it on his forehead, before opening his eyes and clenched it unwaveringly, tossed the sword up 45° as it swirled and plunged into the deep ocean below.</p>
<p>He stood for a few more moments, then turned around, not looking back.</p>
<hr />
<p>On the ground just a tad bit higher than the ocean, with the sun on the far edge of the horizon, and the clouds that painted its spots against the reddish-orange environment, there stood the group watching the final sun set before the separation.</p>
<p>He turned to his left, mustered enough courage to say things that would leave him regret if he hadn't, "...I realized, <em>t-there's something I haven't said yet.</em>"</p>
<p>Her curiosity was piqued, "Oh yeah?"</p>
<p>"I haven't thanked you."</p>
<p>"What's this now?"</p>
<p>"Thank you. For... <em>sticking</em> with me. Without you by my side, I'd <strong>never</strong> have made it here."</p>
<p>She brought her hand to cover her mouth from laughing out, to cover her gratefulness, her nervousness, and perhaps, her awkwardness. With a great smile, she exclaimed, "Oh, come on, you had to say that?"</p>
<p>He retorted, "I'm serious here!"</p>
<p>"I know you are."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>And their eyes met. "Listen, Noah... I feel just the same. Without you, I think... my wishes would never have come true."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>From here onwards, the <em>italics</em> will mean some elation, some reluctance to separation for the rest of the italics. Though, sometimes we retain the soft tone. So, just assumed the elation is in soft tone.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He made some tiny nods, "I see... <em>I guess so!</em>"</p>
<p>Elated, "<em>Mm. So I'll say it too... Thank you, Noah.</em> Truly."{{footnote: And the music starts.}}</p>
<p>Hands by his side, looking up at the sun; accompanied by the shorter one looking at the ground, hands behind her. He commented "We weren't half bad as a team, were we?"</p>
<p>In a snap, "<strong>Yeah</strong> uh... passable, for sure!" She was very sure of the grading.</p>
<p>"<strong>Just 'passable'?! I'm sure you meant...</strong> 'unsurpassable', right?" He turned to look at her attentively, to pressure her. She didn't look at him while he was complaining.</p>
<p>She turned to look at him, "Eheheheh! <em>Oh, I think I'll let you decide the passing grade, Lanzy.</em>"</p>
<p>And he turned away, folded his arms, "Ahhh, come on, weirdo..." Till now, they'd assumed their time was forever... Naturally, it seemed forever...</p>
<p>Continuing the conversation, looking down, the tone turned gloomier, "Guess... we won't be working out together any more."</p>
<p>"Yeah... I'm not keeping tabs, but don't you slack off."</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm not gonna slack off! I'll train every day,</strong> <em>thinking of you.</em>" Those happy days they spent together, 'Cause he was always beside me...</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah! Same here.</em>" And they softly joined their fist without looking at each other. She wept quietly, realizing that these happy days won't ever last. That they met each other and not others, out of all souls they greeted, was a miracle.</p>
<p>"Here." A book with a brown envelope-looking cover, he passed it to her. Taking it over, she questioned,</p>
<p>"What's this?"</p>
<p>While she flipped through the book, he explained, "Herbal tea recipe. You have to dry your own leaves... You should manage."</p>
<p>"Isn't this kinda, pointless?"</p>
<p>"Pointless?"</p>
<p>"I mean, if the worlds are gonna drift apart again, this paper won't last..."</p>
<p>"Eheh!"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmm?</em>"</p>
<p>With a wry smile on his lips, "I considered that, of course." Pointing at the book, "<em>The paper and the ink, it all comes from <strong>your</strong> world.</em>"</p>
<p>"And the leaves for the tea? Even those, and all?"</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>And they got teasingly at each other, "<em>Ehehe, well, check you out!</em>"</p>
<p>"Who am I if not scrupulous?" The pride that shot up high!</p>
<p>Looking back at what he'd written while conversing, "Who? Well... You're my best bud! Fourth best, to be exact."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I see you peacefully, you're in your dream. Everything, seems calm and free, I know.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that was a striking to his pride, "<strong>Only fourth?!</strong>" Then, he went into self-denial doing the counting privately, "Huh? Wait a minute... There's Noah... and Lanz... th... D-did she count, Joran?! <strong>Huh!</strong> Why am I only listing guys...? J-just chill out, Taion! Erm, uh..."</p>
<p>She saw him turned to the other side panicking, wondering, asked teasingly, "<em>What's up? Is there a problem?</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we want this warmth to last forever again, let's go back to that moment of day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Wurr uh uh... <strong>A-at least put me... second, or even third!</strong> Fourth seems a little harsh..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Urhuhuhuh!</strong>" She snapped the book close, teasingly continued, "<em>I'll think about it.</em>"</p>
<p>The most bloodshed scene was perhaps the two that were hugging each other and shedding tears like endless fountains, "<strong>RIIIIIIIKKKKKUUUUUU!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>MAAAAANNNNAAAAANNNNNAAAAAAA!!!</strong>" The other people's chain of thought and conversation were thus disturbed, with their deep yearning for each other. {{footnote: 不舍}}.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As time goes by, and we all change... And not just us, the world keeps changing...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He held out Nimue's watch, snapped it close, announced, "It is time."</p>
<p>On the Agnian side below the Castle, they saw the Agnians standing on one side of the ground, waiting for them. Alexandria, Teach, Miyabi, Isurd, Cammuravi, Juniper, Fiona, and other soldiers behind them. On the Kevesi side below the Castle, on the ground stood Segiri, Valdi, Ethel{{footnote: In her grown up form. <a href="./83_cammuravi_ethel.html">See more for how to grow her up</a>.}}, Bolearis, Zeon, Ashera, and other soldiers. On the middle final side were the City people: Ghondor in the middle, with her bodyguard Oggy and Aggy behind her; Gray{{footnote: Another hero, which we didn't speak about. He's not important to the main storyline anyways, in one's perspective, though he had his story to tell.}} to one side, Monica, Mr. Samon, and Travis on the other side, with other City folks behind.</p>
<p>Sena and Lanz, Taion and Eunie, they had turned back looking at the Sun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But little did I know that this was coming, 'Cause you were there, always smiling... I wonder how you'll be in the future... I wouldn't know.... it's hard to figure...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Guess this is goodbye..." And she looked back at Noah.</p>
<p>"Yeah... Still, even if we're worlds apart, <em>I swear</em> I won't..."</p>
<p>"I won't let go. Not ever. I'll always be with you." She held out her left hand, fingers sticking out; Noah held out his right, and they joined, clenched strong, palms facing each other, "Our feelings... forever interlinked."</p>
<p>"Wherever we are..." Mio took one step forward; Noah held out his other hand and placed it on that side of her face, her ears, feeling her hair and features.</p>
<p>"Yeah. Wherever we are..." And they closed their eyes, she tilted her head upward to the right, and he came down from his right, and their lips met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But by accepting, this feeling inside, we'll eventually create a miracle. I see you smiling there, so peacefully, and cheerfully, I see you talk at me. These happy days must carry on...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On top of the balcony of the Kevesi Castle, Melia stated, "Our worlds in their current states... are still young. If in passing, they do themselves harm. I suppose, <strong><em>even then they cannot but carry on.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Nia, on top of the Agnus Castle, "Still, <em>I have faith. Even if now</em>, we become separated for a time, one day we'll surely... <em>get to walk hand-in-hand again...</em>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So once again, let's go back to that day... to where we held, hand in hand.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Melia was back inside her room, looking at the image that replaced the mirror on her dressing table. The drawer that held the image slid down to reveal the Monado{{footnote: Well, that's something from Xenoblade 1, if you want to know.}} that Shulk{{footnote: The guy she loved.}} used; a replica or a model of it probably, framed, reminiscing. "Everyone... Thank you..."</p>
<p>Inside the Cloud Keep, the central blast furnace opened up with some smoke coming out, and out shot Poppi{{footnote: The robot that a nopon made that fought by her side in Xenoblade 2.}}, whom ran towards her, whom was standing by the edge of the Cloud Keep. They greeted and smiled at each other; she felt glad they could speak again. On the table where she stood stood the family photo with the large group she used to adventure with.{{footnote: So that Nopon one cannot remember the name and lazy to search, but he created Poppy, standing beside him. Then, seated were Mythra, Pyra, and Nia with their child, and a grown up Rex, with his hands on the chair. Dromarch was the tiger that was beside Nia; that's her partner before she met the others. Then there's Zeke the Zekenator and his blade, forgot the name. Morag and her blade Bridgid to Rex's right. As a <strong>spoiler to the children</strong>: Mio is Nia's child, Pyra's child is Glimmer, one of the founders of the new City which you can found in the memorial hall. One don't know who's Mythra's child.}} "<em>I will see you soon, then.</em>"</p>
<p>The drifting land started, parting their lips. Looking into each others eyes, all they see from each other was yearning. The short time they had left, feeling each other's breathe hitting on each other's face. He put down his hand that held on to her face.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I see you peacefully, you're in your dreams...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As they drifted further and further, their heart to heart, held by their hands, ringed and ringed. Touching palms became crossing fingers; crossing fingers brushed against each other, and they could only felt the remnants of warmth from a moment ago. She was still yearningly looking to retaining him, before the ground filled her sight, with a rush of regret.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Everything, seems calm and free, I know.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She put down her arm slowly, naturally. How does he feel? She looked up; he was looking at her all the time, the calmness on his face that reveals none.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If, we want, this warmth, to last...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The land continued drifting apart, and they could only watch each other getting further and further. The others were looking at their respective partner, though they were farther behind the two.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Forever again, let's go back to <strong>that</strong> moment of day.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She grit her teeth; he grit his. And he made a dash for it. She immediately followed.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I see you smiling now, so peacefully, and cheerfully, talking at me!</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Faster! <strong>Faster!</strong> <strong>FASTER!!!</strong> They swung their feet as fast as they could, as large as they could. They don't care if it breaks or kick a stone; they had to reach each other, the opposite that they yearned so much, to join and become whole. Yet, the ground does not agree. No matter how fast they go, the ground go with them, like on a treadmill that go nowhere.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>These happy days, must carry on... So once a-gain, let's go back, to the start. This goodbye is not the end, I know, <em>until we meet again</em>...</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>She held out her hands, trying to reach his. He, after a few more steps, raised his, trying to reach for hers. Until he stumbled as the overlapping ground stopped overlapping and created an abyss in between.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Our fee-lings will, remain the same, together as one, till we find ourselves, again.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>They stopped by one side of the abyss; and the other side did the same. After catching their breathe, looking at the unreachable from afar, he shouted to the figure that got farther, smaller, blurrier, that "<strong>ONE DAY!!!... I'll come see you! I promise!</strong>" And waved to her.</p>
<p>Distance could not prevent their voice from traveling{{footnote: Despite dampened, one supposed.}}. "<strong>Me too!!!... One day...! I promise!</strong>" She waved her hands back strongly in the air, full of promises and emotions.</p>
<p>And further and further, all put down their hands as the other side blurred into a silhouette in the distance, swallowed by the evening sun.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, narrating: "This, <strong>is the truth</strong>, of our world."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The smile on their face did not sway even as they lose their loved ones{{footnote: All except the philosophical Noah.}}; for they had prepared for this day, though not fully at the last minute. But no longer could they revert their decisions after it'd been made.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Memories melt in the morning light, and then, a new day begins... <strong><em>Roads stretch out before us, so many paths. Which do you choose? That's up to you. Sometimes, you might run astray. You'll stop, maybe cry in frustration. But you know, that's all right. For the roads... They go on without end. So look up, face forward, toward your chosen horizon... And just... walk on.</em></strong>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And the world at the other end drifted into nothingness; they could no longer see. As the sun sets, the final light shimmered out of existence, marking an end for the unticking clocks.</p>
<hr />
<p>The long hand of the clock ticked 12, and the tower bell rang, waking up Noah the child.</p>
<p>"Ohhh..." He blinked his eyes as his blurred vision came into focus, still looking up on the air. A flock of pigeons fluttered on top of him, soared into the evening sky. Relaxing, energetic, exhausted, people just mind their own businesses, taking to their destinations. Or, like the children in the small pool around the obelisk, playing with water.</p>
<p>"<strong>Nooooah!</strong>" Lanz shouted from afar. "<strong>What're you doing, man? They'll start the fireworks without us!</strong>"</p>
<p>He was with Eunie and Joran, waiting for him to catch up. Eunie urged, "<strong>Get a move on already, or all the good spots'll be taken!</strong>"</p>
<p>Joran, waving his arms at him, jumping, "<strong>Exactly! So c'mon, move it!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Sorry! I zoned out for a sec. I'm coming!</strong>" After waving back at them, and they took off waiting for him no longer, he heard the fireworks overtaking the air. Various explosions, various roars of laughters and cheers filled the air.</p>
<p>As he was running after them, something triggered him. He slowed to a stop and looked to his left. No one he was looking for, or at least, he was hoping to look for, was there. Only the melody of Crys and Agnian ringed in his ears. Others seemed to either not hear it, or they were being desensitized with it. What is it that's missing from one? Awestruck for a second, he can't recall. Though, the music makes him happy; and with a smile, he walked on, not looking back, while the music continued.</p>
<hr />
<p>Closed, no longer opened.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Mio's Diary:</strong> As the morning sun rises, my lingering memories fade. I no longer see your silhouette. It's too far gone into the haze. But, <em>hey... It's all right. I won't forget you. Not until we can meet again... I swear it.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Translator's Note:</strong> Miyabi, being Mio's close friends and one whom changed her life and influenced her thoughts earlier, would worth look closer into. Here we'll tell a story about Miyabi. This would happen after Mio's side story, after Miyabi moved to the City, and when the group had time to visit the City after whatever they're on to.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The restaurant, Michiba's Canteen, in the City had unusually full of people today. Mio was the first to notice, questioned, "It seems pretty lively over there. What's the occasion?"</p>
<p>Miyabi was well-informed, "There's supposed to be some kind of cooking contest. Maybe they're preparing for it?"</p>
<p>Now that was interest attracting, esp. to <em>someone</em>, "<strong>Ohoho! Someone say cooking contest?!</strong>"{{footnote: Manana was the someone, of course.}}</p>
<p>Then someone asked, "You think they'd let me participate...?"</p>
<p>Sena was surprised at who said that, "Huh?! I didn't know you cooked, Lanz!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Me?</strong> Nah. I'm all about the eating! <strong>Think of all that grub</strong>!" Now <em>that</em> sounds more like what he would be doing.</p>
<p>"<em>Ahhh! Maybe I should join too</em>..." Both interested, eh!</p>
<p>"Hey there, folks!" Travis{{footnote: If you hadn't already know from Lanz's Side Story, he's the highest sidekicks of Monica; apparently the CEO/manager that handles all the stuffs if Monica doesn't have enough attention to handle or just too low level for her 'City Elder' status.}} appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The group turned to face them, with Noah doing the speaking, "Travis. Monica. We just heard about this cooking contest."</p>
<p>"<strong>Yeah?</strong> It's kind of a tradition around here. You know how the world is. Can't set foot outside without putting yourself in danger. People are going stir-crazy, all shut up with nowhere to go. They need a bit of <em>light entertainment</em>{{footnote: Spoken slowly to emphasize.}} to diffuse some of that stress, so these contests are, kind of a regular thing."</p>
<p>Monica invited, "This seems like the perfect opportunity for you to join in."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>To sample the food?!</strong>" His mind haven't got off that!</p>
<p>Travis disappointed him, "Ahhh... I'm afraid the judges are selected by <em>majority</em> vote. They've already been decided well in advance." And Lanz and Sena just disappointedly dropped their heads. But there's a turnback, "That said, the winning dishes do get shared among the audience." And their heads popped back up!</p>
<p>Mio questioned, "So, you'd like us to join as chefs?"</p>
<p>"<strong>YESSSSS!!! Count Manana In!!!! Manana been champing at bit for cookery action!</strong>" Her wings fluttered with her dance of joy.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Hahaha, yeah... This event's pretty much made for Manana."</p>
<p>"<strong>Word!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Miyabi thought for quite a long pause before nervously spoke out, "C-could I... Could I join as well?!"</p>
<p>Monica calmly replied, "I like your spirit. You're both very welcome."</p>
<p>Travis: "Looks like you'll have your work cut out for you, eh, Boss."</p>
<p>"You said it, Travis. I'll let you prepare the Lucky Spice."</p>
<p>"<strong>AWWWW, tch, crap! Not that stuff...</strong>" Just thinking of it was... unbearable?</p>
<p>She ignored him, continued her introduction of the contest to the group, "There are no binding rules, no themes to follow. You're free to make whatever you like. But you are expected to bring your own ingredients. Once you have them, take them to Michiba at her canteen. She'll hold onto them for you."</p>
<p>Manana: "Hearing loud and clear!"</p>
<p>And she was ready to depart, "I'll see you at the contest then."</p>
<p>Miyabi: "Looking forward to it!"</p>
<p>After they left, "Manana not pull punches! <em>We rivals now</em>, Miss Miyabi!"</p>
<p>Miyabi bent down to look at her about the same height, excitedly commented, "Yes, let's do this!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Since when did you learn to cook, Miyabi? You never told me!"</p>
<p>"Ahahaha. I've only dabbled, really."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Right! We'd better go out looking for our ingredients, eh?" And he already decided to leave.</p>
<p>The group watched him starting to walk away, until Taion called him to a halt, to pause and think longer, "Hold on, we haven't even decided what we're going to make yet."</p>
<p>"Uh-huh. Just testin' ya."{{footnote: OK, to save face, we'll go with it.}}</p>
<p>Miyabi suggested, "Before we decide, maybe we should ask around the City first? See what kind of foods they like, their favorite seasonings... That should give us enough to make a start on."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed, "True... We need some kind of direction to start with before we can think about making anything."</p>
<p>The rest already leave, including Miyabi, ready to get a head start. Noah saw Mio still standing there, prompted, "Something on your mind, Mio?"{{footnote: Actually, Sena saw too, but she just leave after Noah decided to  stood still. There's a tacit agreement between the animation maker on when the 'signal' is sent without even looking behind her back.}}</p>
<p>She shook her head, walked nearer to him, and questioned out loud, "I was just thinking, it's unusual for Miyabi to voice her interest in something like this. Before, she'd always try to avoid anything that involved competition. So this is... <strong>kind of a surprise.</strong>"{{footnote: In her appreciation stance.}}</p>
<p>"Hah, I see... Well, <em>all the more reason for us to cheer her on</em>."</p>
<p>"Yeah."</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside by a white sandy floor, camping as the sun was about to go to sleep, Sena exclaimed, "Everybody's super excited for this contest."</p>
<p>Taion: "Most likely they're excited about getting a taste of the winning meal."</p>
<p>Mio: "...Hey, Miyabi? Can I ask you something?"</p>
<p>"Hm? Sure."</p>
<p>"You didn't enter this contest just because you wanted to win, did you?"</p>
<p>"...No, I didn't. It's because I feel indebted to the people of the City. I wanted to take this opportunity to show them my appreciation."</p>
<p>Sena: "Awwww, how sweet! That's just like you!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Yeah, you haven't changed a bit. You've always been like this."{{footnote: In real life, people do change, actually, albeit ranging from slightly to largely. But if they had a core philosophy, that probably won't change much, perhaps minor tweaks to fit into the modern world where things were before obsolete, or hadn't been met in the past. Unless their core changes, that probably stays. Other stuffs changes, though. }}</p>
<p>"Meh-hrm... Regardless of ulterior motive of Miyabi, Manana is innit to winnit! Will not hesitate to clash with full force of Manana might!"</p>
<p>"That's totally fine, Manana. Give it your all!"</p>
<p>Noah directed the conversation to the main topic of today, "All right, let's go over what we've learned."</p>
<p>Lanz made a head start, "From what we've heard, we should serve a huge portion of something, with a flavor that packs a wallop." Now that was vague, but if they've all experienced it before, it serves as an anchor to retrieve their memory.</p>
<p>Taion added, "It seems that the presentation is also highly regarded in addition to flavor. Something that'll deliver an impact."</p>
<p>Noah: "An impact, huh... That's setting the bar pretty high..."</p>
<p>Sena, with a "But others were saying they'd like homemade dishes. Something they'd feel familiar with."</p>
<p>Mio: "Given that we don't know who the judges will be, it might be best to go for something neutral that everyone can enjoy."{{footnote: Not true, if you'd read <em>Different</em> by Youngme Moon. Neutral means blending into the background, average, not standing out of the crowd, tasteless.}}</p>
<p>Eunie got her head swirling, "So... doesn't this just mean that they'll enjoy pretty much whatever we throw at them?" Never mind you; you're not gonna cook anyways.</p>
<p>Miyabi: "In that case... I think I know what might be good to try..."</p>
<p>Inside her thoughts, her eyes gleaming with stars, "Meh heh heh... Secret weapon of Manana will guarantee surefire win..."</p>
<p>Eunie noticed her eyes, "Hmm? You're looking pretty confident there, love."</p>
<p>"Meh heh heh... That because Manana already thought up ultimate recipe of ultimate delicious! Current name of dish... is closely guarded secret!" OK, Manana, OK.</p>
<p>Miyabi can feel her, "Haha! Yes, you don't want to be telling your competitors."</p>
<p>"Exactly! Anticipation must be savored!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Looks like you two have already got your entries sorted. Guess next up's getting the ingredients?"</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "What'll you need for your dish, Manana?"</p>
<p>"Meh! Manana will need Mottlemarble Aries Meat, Killjoy Crustip Meat, Cozy Rhogul Egggems, and Lucky Marrin Thickcuts!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Huh... They're a pretty big deal, is what I'm getting here..." Difficult to get stuffs, or the monsters difficult to kill.</p>
<p>Mio: "How about you, Miyabi?"</p>
<p>"Umm... Smushi Rice, Refreshing Piranhax Meat, Glitter Radishes... and Soyprime Sauce... Though we can probably ask the City folk to share some with us."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Huh... That all sounds like pretty average stuff."</p>
<p>"Yes, um... I'd really like to prepare something that anyone can make, using familiar ingredients."</p>
<p>"Yeah, you're totally winning people over that way!"</p>
<p>Mio: "So, who to start with?"{{footnote: Here, you can choose. It doesn't matter who to start with, the end result will be the same.}}</p>
<p>After decision, Mio announced, "We'll start with Manana's."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohohoho!</strong> Manana pleased to welcome aboard all affiliated parties!"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the City's Michiba's Canteen, Sena announced, "That's the last of Manana's ingredients!" The kitchen was wood-made; and those of metal looked very old and even rusty. Cardboard, cooler (fridge/refrigerator), cpuboards, the walls, floors, beams. Perhaps it was the lighting partly, and perhaps it was supposed to be old partly.{{footnote: Note, here only got 4 person: Sena, Mio, Miyabi, and Manana. The rest are nowhere to be seen. Maybe behind the camera? Or maybe waiting outside? And second note: the place is just over the counter. It also served as the 'cashier/counter' where you'd pay your bills after eating.}}</p>
<p>"Many thankings! Friends did bang-up job!"</p>
<p>"Now, for Miyabi's..."</p>
<p>"That's it! Thanks again! We should talk to people in the City to see if anyone can give us the Soyprimo Sauce."</p>
<hr />
<p>Approching a blonde-hair lady whom was inspecting some boxes in an extremely dark alley, Miyabi called for her attention, "Boxy..."</p>
<p>She turned her attention to the group, "Oh, hey Miyabi! You're with your friends today?"{{footnote: That includes Noah and the others, not just the 4 at the counter earlier.}}</p>
<p>"Yes, sorry if we're bothering you."</p>
<p>"Not at all, <strong>not at all!</strong> Always nice to see you. So what brings you here?"</p>
<p>"Actually, I've decided to enter the cooking contest..."</p>
<p>"Oooohhh, really?!"</p>
<p>"I'd like it if you came. I'm going to try as hard as I can!"{{footnote: Miyabi's iris actually glowed in the incadescent greenish-hue light. Actually, the light reflected off her eyes like those of cats at night but less ghost-y.}}</p>
<p>"Sweetie, I would love to! I'll be cheering you on all the way!"</p>
<p>"There's... one other thing... I have a request, if it's not too much trouble."</p>
<p>"Tell me. Anything I can do to help."</p>
<p>"Would you mind sharing some of your Soyprimo Sauce? Your homemade recipe?"</p>
<p>"<strong>My sauce is going to feature...?! This just keeps getting better and better!</strong> Please, take as much as you need!"</p>
<p>After she came back fetching the sauce, she handed them to Miyabi, "I'm sure it'll be enough, but if by any chance you run out, just swing by again. Romero{{footnote: Something unrelated, Romero was trying to run away with Julietta, so they could love each other forever.}} absolutely loves that sauce. I've got <strong>jars</strong> full of the stuff."</p>
<p>"<strong>Thank you so much...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hahah! You're getting awfully worked up about all this. <em>Just relax</em>, and enjoy the experience."</p>
<p>"Yes, ma'am! ...<strong>Ah!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hahahah! Now what did I just say?"</p>
<p>"Hehehehe...." fAnd her eyes curled into a crescent moon shape.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back at the kitchen, Mio announced, "That's all of the ingredients, for the both of them."{{footnote: Yeah, still the four.}}</p>
<p>"<strong>Tippy-toppy job!</strong>"</p>
<p>Michiba appeared over the counter, "Got everything you need now? Then I think it's about time to start the contest. <em>Is everyone ready?</em>"</p>
<p>You bet!</p>
<hr />
<p>At the front of the canteen. The table and chairs had been cleared out for the audience to surround a huge round table of ankle-high. The people of the City who were interested already gathered around in a giant circle. The judges sat themselves down by one side of the table, surrounded in a semicircle by the people. At the other side stood emptier: only Travis and the chefs. Travis would be the moderator for today.</p>
<p>"Looks like both the chefs and the judges are ready. Well, ladies and gents, it's time to start another <em>annual</em> cook-off! And who else to narrate the events as they unfold <strong>but</strong> the City's number one Charmer..."</p>
<p>Then Monica gave him <em>that</em> look, and he just turned his head away from her... "...Just kidding -- it's me, Travis, your ever-affable Lost Numbers lieutenant. Let's start by introducing our expert panel of judges... The lucky four adjudicators for this year's <em>incredible</em> turnout are... Drumroll, please..."</p>
<p>Nobody drumroll, but he didn't expected one either. "<strong>Ghondor!</strong> You've been begging to be a judge for ages now. Looks like it's your lucky day!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oooiiii!!!</strong> Don't you bloody patronize me. You'll be laughing on the other side of your face if you're not careful..."</p>
<p>"Ur urg ahem! <em>Moving</em> swiftly on..." He turned towards a purple nopon with eyeglasses so short that they bordered the center bottom tip of his eyes; and he carried a giant abacus behind. "You fancy yourself an avid foodie? Well, let's see how you measure up to the wise and erudite Wellwell!"</p>
<p>Turning to the right, an old man whom gave everyone a very dull look on his face, "Next up, a lover of music and all things lyrical... It's Mr. Boomer! He's got a refined palate for music and food, and I'm sure he's about to give us a piece of his mind!" He already closed his eyes, for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Then, a child wearing a bucket on his head, with <em>very</em> large eyes, "Last but not least, we have our youngest judge on record! Introducing San! Far as I can tell, he just plain enjoys food. He'll eat whatever you can throw at him!"</p>
<p>"Tehehehehe, yeah! Gimme all your food!"</p>
<p>"We want you four to judge the meals on their own merits, as honestly as possible. Now, let's introduce our chefs! First up's our Lost Numbers ace cook, Nissick!" That's a brown-blonde hair guy with turquoise iris, having a stern look. "So, how're you feelin'? Think you've got the potential to be numero uno? Hehehe..."</p>
<p>"Grrrr....."{{footnote: HAHHAHAHAHAHA!}} He's just looking at Ghondor all the time. Is she making him angry?</p>
<p>As Ghondor looking towards him, he turned his head away; and Travis warned, "Watch it, you. No intimidating the judges! You're gonna scare the kid! You wanna settle the score, you do it with food. <em>Calm and peaceful-like</em>!"</p>
<p>"Next up, it's our very own boss! <strong>Or, should that be Elder...? Eh err oh, let's just say.. Madam... Monica</strong>?"</p>
<p>"Just stick to the usual. Who's next?"</p>
<p>"<em>All right, 'Boss' it is.</em> Next, we have Ouroboros's very own <em>Queen</em> of Cuisine, Manana!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Manana ready to steal away hearts and stomachs of all!</strong>"</p>
<p>"And whispers on the grapevine tell me our last contestant is a rising star! She's everyone's sweetheart, Miss Miyabi!"</p>
<p>Boxy: "<strong>You go, girl!!</strong>" Well, you really come to cheer!</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh!" Miyabi turned and saw her standing behind Ghondor, nodded to her in surprise.</p>
<p>"And those are our four entrants for today. Shall we get started? Then Nissick, if you'd like to <em>reveal</em> the meal!" He nodded and went back to fetch it.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<strong>Feast your eyes... on this!</strong>" On a plate, a green lobster with some meat, some orange (or is it lemon?), and some other unknown ingredients (salad leaf, and is that mushroom?), plus some sauce.</p>
<p>San: "So cool!"</p>
<p>Wellwell: "Well, well, well... Applying heat cause emergence of emerald green undertones... Shell gradually transluce as it shine with beryl glaze. Behold... <strong>the Jade Lobster</strong>!" OK, that's the chemistry... Thanks for explaining, well well....</p>
<p>Ghondor scrutinized, "Is this thing edible?"</p>
<p>Nissick: "...Hrmph!!!" Now that heats up.</p>
<hr />
<p>After eating, Ghondor actually changed her mind, "<strong>Mmm! Hey, this is pretty tasty!</strong> <em>And juicy!</em>" And she got another bite of it.</p>
<p>Wellwell: "Contrary to expectation, taste pop and lock inside mouth... <strong>Big bang of umami fill entire tastebuds!</strong>"</p>
<p>Boomer: "Hmmhmm, hm hm hmmm..." That's middling tone, "hm hm hmm..." And he continued to get bites of it, nodded.{{footnote: Couldn't speak, could ya...}}</p>
<p>San: "Hey! How're you s'posed to eat this? I don't get it..."</p>
<p>Travis suggested, "Maybe Nissick would be kind enough to assist..."</p>
<p>"<strong>I beg your pardon?!</strong>" Nope, not kind enough!</p>
<hr />
<p>"Let's check in with our next culinary combatant! It's our very own boss!"</p>
<p>Ghondor, inside her heart, "Heh... I'll find a chink in your armor..."</p>
<p>"My dish is the Monicurry... Special!" Rice, some sausages, and curry at one side.</p>
<p>Ghondor: "<strong>Oh, come on! How's that fair?</strong>" No more chink for you, eh!</p>
<p>San: "Ah! It's got Tasty Sausages in it!"</p>
<p>"Well, well, well! Wellwell only heard rumors, but Monicurry said to be <em>legendary</em> meal among Lost Numbers!"</p>
<p>Jansen was already eager, "...I'll have me some of that."</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor had to change her heart, "Nngh, damn you, Bitchqueen! You got the spiciness spot on!"</p>
<p>Boomer was drinking from his cup, blowing steam, "Hooo hooo hoo, Ooh! Slurp!" Too spicy for him, probably!</p>
<p>Wellwell: "These vegetables... Flavor, normally distinctive, yet subtly veiled here... And spiciness <em>perfectly</em> compensate... But despite this, single plate appear positively heaped with <em>nutrition</em>...? Is dish spice-renowned, or something deeper...?"</p>
<p>"Urgh... It's making my tongue all prickly..."</p>
<p>Travis laughed at that, "Hohoho oops... Guess the kid's tastebuds weren't quite prepared for that just yet hehehheheheh!"</p>
<p>Thinking in her heart, "Funny... Everyone normally loves the stuff. <em>Did I add too much Lucky Spice</em>...?"</p>
<hr />
<p>"I'm sure your bellies are gradually getting rounder, but there's plenty more where that came from! The next contender is... Manana!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Finally! Time for big moment!</strong> Delicious dish of Manana is... Secret recipe of Nopon, passed down in greatest of stealthy! Or rather, little spin on traditional version... <strong>Doodlenoodles, Manana-style! Prepare for taste beyond taste</strong>!" Well, some bread-like stuffs and meat arranged in a circle around the bowl, with some eggs placed in an inner circle; and finally, some other ingredients wrapped around the central circle. That's very full! Plus that flag on top of the central egg-like object...</p>
<p>San, just by its look, "<strong>That looks yummy!</strong> This is gonna be awesome!"</p>
<p>Ghondor was impressed, "Whoa! That's gonna be a banger."</p>
<p>"<em>Tears of Wellwell might form small pool</em>... To think Nopon exist that could <em>recreate recipe of legend</em>...!"</p>
<p>Even Riku was shocked, "O-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho...!" This is a must-try for Nopon! MUST-TRY!!!!</p>
<hr />
<p>Boomer: "<strong>Hohohoho! Hmhm! Hohohohohoh!</strong>" Clearly very tasty! He laughed 'until stomach ache'.</p>
<p>San: "Gimme more of this meat! More! <strong>Moooore!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Wellwell never <strong>dream</strong> of chance to eat <em>perfect</em> Doodlenoodles in lifetime... Taste is <em>beyond compare</em>...! <strong>Such level of extravagant.</strong> Wellwell could well <strong>rocket into skies above</strong>!" Tears started rolling down his face of extreme happiness.</p>
<p>"How the crap is this <strong>so good?!</strong> I don't know what to say!"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Oooooo the competition's fierceeee, but we've got one more dish lined up for you all! Take it away, Miyabi!"</p>
<p>"OK...! Here's the meal I'll be presenting today..." A simple bowl of rice, some fish slices on a platter (with a strain of vegetable leaves on top of them), and another bowl with sauces and some 'decorations' (that looked like tofu or something) on top of it.</p>
<p>Boomer: "Oooooh?"</p>
<p>San: "Huh. It doesn't look very special..."</p>
<p>Ghondor agreed, "<em>I guess, when you put it alongside the others, yeah...</em>"</p>
<p>"But it clearly made with love! Preparation of dish, reflect nature <em>of chef</em>. And this <strong>noooo</strong> exception... "</p>
<hr />
<p>Ghondor: "Ahhh, it feels... <em>How should I put it...?</em> Comforting."</p>
<p>"Mmmh, so understated, yet <strong>so palatable... Hard to express</strong> in words... Like warmth filling entire body..."</p>
<p>"I eat this fish all the time, but I don't think it's ever been <strong>this</strong> tasty before!"</p>
<p>A City resident was amused, "Gosh! I wonder how she prepared it...? I'd love to know!"</p>
<p>Mei{{footnote: From the Lost Numbers?}} "Same! Why don't we go and ask her once the contest's over?"</p>
<p>"Mei, you have the <strong>best</strong> ideas!"</p>
<p>Boxy: "Now that looks scrumptious. They look like they're loving the Soyprimo Sauce, too!"</p>
<p>And Boomer was just singing all the while he was eating. "Hm hm hm hmmm, hm hm hm hmmm. Mmhmmm... Tastessss gooooood...."{{footnote: First time he talks eh. He had difficulty talking, even the words are stretched long.}}</p>
<p>Miyabi appreciated the reaction the judges had on her heartily-prepared meal. Mio and Sena felt the success they'd helped, for Miyabi to realize her potential, to realize what she wanted to give back had been met with happiness.</p>
<hr />
<p>Travis, animately, "Nowwwwww, I haaate to break it to you, folks, but it's time for the judges to make their decision. <em>Which of these</em> four <strong>outstanding</strong> meals has satisfied their stomachs?! I'm sure you're all on the edge of your seats... The winner of this year's cooking contest <strong>is...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Miyabi's heart was... not pounding. Outwardly looking calm, hope not very high perhaps.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the contest, many gathered around the huge table, sitting down eating. Manana's doodlenoodles were lined on the tables for everyone to try. Some kids at the other side preferred Miyabi's preparations. Other people just gathered further away from the tables, in groups, talking. Manana and Miyabi were sharing their cooking with those two whom approached them. That's not all. Outside the Canteen, by a table, lined plates of Monicurry. More people were talking. Nissick had a platter of doodlenoodles for himself, sitting lonely there; but two other female Lost Numbers had his Jade Lobster -- they stood close to where he sat. Travis and Monica stood at the corner; and Ghondor alone at a table behind Monica, more food. Behind Ghondor are another table with nobodies{{footnote: LOL}} gathering.</p>
<p>Back at the central table. While Noah and Taion was busy speaking behind, Lanz got a try of every single recipe -- he finally could taste all the food! Too bad Sena didn't join in; but hey! Riku had like, what, 5 bowls of doodlenoodles lined in front of him, all for himself, sitting beside Lanz?</p>
<p>Seeing that the two leave Manana and Miyabi alone, Mio could finally approached the two that now chatted among themselves.</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>Congratulations, Manana!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Meh-heh-heh! Feels good at top!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Better luck next time, Miyabi."</p>
<p>"Thanks, everyone. You all helped me sooo much. I didn't make first place, but I'm glad everyone got the chance to try my food. Manana was kind enough to raise the idea. Thank you, Manana."</p>
<p>"Aww, <strong>not to mention!</strong> Would be terrible shame for friends to miss out <em>delicious nomnoms</em> of Miyabi!"</p>
<p>Olive, one of the female of the two, said softly, "Nissick looks in a right mood."</p>
<p>After finished drinking from his cup, he announced loudly, "<strong>I can hear you.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Can't let 'em get away with this though, can we? We'll lend you a hand next time!"</p>
<p>"Hmph..." But he nodded; just his face cannot put down so easily, but the girls knew it.</p>
<p>Monica had seated herself opposite of Ghondor, "How d'you like the Monicurry, Ghondor?"</p>
<p>"Wh-why're you asking me? Same as you always make it. The name's dumb, though. Couldn't you come up with something better?!"</p>
<p>"You say that every time. I don't see the problem, personally. I actually kind of like it."</p>
<p>"I'm not asking YOUR opinion! <em>I'm saying</em> <strong>it's freakin' embarrassing!</strong>"</p>
<p>Monica just looked at her for a moment, disregarded that, "I've still got some left, by the way. You want a bowl, or not?"</p>
<p>"Don't change the subject! And... <em>of course I want a bowl!</em>" Giving, in, giving in, <strong>giving in!</strong></p>
<p>Miyabi watched all these interactions, seemed to be enjoying herself. Commenting, "Ahh, that contest was so much fun!"</p>
<p>"Maaaximum agree! Plus was big learning experience! Can see Manana need to <strong>greatly</strong> expand repertoire!"</p>
<p>"Ah...! If... that's your plan, would you mind... teaching me some more about cooking?"</p>
<p>That was a surprise. "Meh-meh? Even though Miyabi already <strong>plenty</strong> good at cooking?"</p>
<p>"Ahah, I'm honored that you'd say so. But I really don't have a lot of experience. I'd love it if you could teach me some more."</p>
<p>"<strong>Ohoho!</strong> Then let Manana <em>pick up what Miyabi putting downnnn</em>... Miyabi asking to become apprentice of Manana?"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's right! ...If it's</strong> <em>not a problem?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>No problem! Manana welcome with open wings!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, that's wonderful! Thank you, Manana!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Ah!</strong> Before Manana forget... <em>Should snaffle up recipes of Monica and Nissick while still have chance!</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh, good idea! Let's do that!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Hey, Miyabi." Mio suddenly called out from behind.</p>
<p>"You did great there! Your food was amazing!" Sena was beside her.</p>
<p>Putting her head down, "Iah... I said before... that I did this... for the City. Of course, they were the highest priority in my mind..." Then raising her head to look at them, "But really, it was for the both of you. I so wanted you to try it."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>It was for us?</em>"</p>
<p>She stood up: "This world... It's filled with nothing but tragedy and hardship for us. But now... after coming here, that feels, like a distant dream... " They looked around the people here and there, standing or sitting around, "Yeah, that's right... You've always kept my wishes in your heart, haven't you? That's why you brought me here, right? <strong><em>Because we're alive, we get to see these sights... Thank you...</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Mio felt the heaviness in her heart, get into her appreciation stance, appreciated her appreciation. "No, Miyabi... Thank <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>"Monica! Can we talk?" In the war room, Noah and his group met Monica and Travis.</p>
<p>"What's up? Sounds ominous."</p>
<p>"We were... hoping we could ask you about someone... Guernica, in fact."</p>
<p>Her eyebrows raised, "About Dad?"</p>
<p>Mio commented, "Everyone in the City speaks so highly of him. But we still don't know a whole lot about him. I think we owe him that much."</p>
<p>Without further thinking, she proceeded, "All right. Where do you wanna start?"</p>
<p>Noah: "You were brought up by him, right? So... we thought you'd probably understand him better than anyone else."</p>
<p>"<strong>HAH!</strong> I wish that <em>were</em> the case." After a short pause, she continued, "The Guernica Vandham that I knew, was a man that <em>I always looked up to.</em> He was always <em>busy keeping the City together, or fighting out on the front line...</em> Always distant... After I chose a military life, <em>he didn't even talk to me like a parent any more.</em>"</p>
<p>"You mean... you weren't on very good terms?"</p>
<p>"I got to know the man, <em>I think</em>. But not the father. <em>I just thought... that we'd have more time together...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>" All dropped their head in unison, the mood dark. Perhaps that's why she also treated her daughter the same?</p>
<p>Just then, Travis intercepted, "'Ey, Boss... <em>You're making the kids feel guilty...</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh, Ah, <em>sorry</em>. I don't blame you guys for any of this. Dad... Guernica... died in the line of duty, trying to accomplish his aim. <em>But that's not all.</em> He died fighting for what he believed in; and he saw it through. Of that much I'm sure."</p>
<p>Mio, in her appreciation stance, "<em>For what he believed in...</em>"</p>
<p>Travis added, "Well, about that... There- still might be a bit of un-finished business there. He sure was adamant about getting stuff <em>home</em> to people."</p>
<p>"Yeah, <em>for certain.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio didn't get it, "Sorry, what do you mean exactly?"</p>
<p>Travis explained, "Personal effects, from the deceased. Things that, family and friends can remember them by... We don't <em>leave</em> any other mark behind that says 'we were here', you see. If there are people waiting for you, <em>then you just want to leave something behind, whatever it may be.</em>" After a short pause, he continued his story, "I was in the rear guard. I know just how dangerous that battlefield was... <em>Maybe, it's... better not to dwell on that.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmm...</em>" Noah therefore asked, "But... there <em>are</em> personal items that have been left behind though, right?"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Maybe... you'd let us do something to help out with that. It must be really painful for the people who never got the chance for closure."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, right? I'm starting to get a handle of how they see things <em>in the City. Sort of...</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "But if there's something we can do about it, I wanna try to help."</p>
<p>Monica shook her head, "<em>I appreciate the sentiment, guys. But why go to all this trouble?</em>"</p>
<p>Taion explained, "Well, we'll get some closure from doing this too. <em>We were losing friends every day</em>."</p>
<p>Mio added: "And before we became Ouroboros, some of us used to be off-seers." And she turned to Noah whom was already attracted to her speech. They both nodded at each other, understood each other's feelings, and know they wanted to do something about it, to let the others feel better too! Turning back to Monica, "Guernica went to all that trouble for others. And when it happened... he was thinking of <em>everyone waiting for him in the City. So I'd like to help his voice find its way.</em>"</p>
<p>Monica: "Hmm..."</p>
<p>Travis: "Much appreciated... Speaking personally, <em>good on ya.</em>"</p>
<p>Monica therefore asked after thinking for a bit, "Travis, could you pull up the tactical register?"</p>
<p>"Roger that! Give me a moment." And he touched his iris to find the 'app'. The rest touched their iris to receive "There's- the data. We've got a list of deceased soldiers and the likely locations where they fell. Could you check out the waypoints around Alfeto Valley?"</p>
<p>Taion: "That's some impressive precision!"</p>
<p>And here came his self-loathing, "<strong>Kind of you to notice! See, that's the thing about us Lost Numbers</strong>... We just don't know when to quit!"</p>
<p>Monica: "Ahahah! OK, guys. It's up to you now. When you're done, could you meet me at the Remembrance Stone?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Got it. You have my word!"</p>
<hr />
<p>After gathering the belongings, they found Travis standing in front of one of the memorial stones. Hearing their incoming, he turned around while Noah announced, "We've brought their belongings."</p>
<p>"Thanks. Means a lot. Can you... lay them out here?" And Noah therefore placed the belongings in front of the stone after Travis moved aside for him to put himself forward.</p>
<p>Sena recalled, "Now you mention it... Didn't Monica put an eyepatch here...?"</p>
<p>Eunie affirmed, "Yeah. That was Guernica's."</p>
<p>Taion wanted to know more about "What does it mean exactly? Placing people's belongings here?"</p>
<p>Travis: "<em>Uhh, how can I explain it...? Erm...</em> You guys have, off-seeing, right? I guess- this is- our version <em>of that.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Off-seeing for City folk... <em>Hmmm...</em>"</p>
<p>While they were in deep thought, Monica approached silently from behind before calling for their attention, "You got here first."</p>
<p>"Boss! We were... waiting for you." The rest of the people whom their family members died followed behind Monica. After exchanging nods, the group, Travis, and Monica moved aside for the people who lost their loved ones to move forward.</p>
<p>Mei: "<em>Brother Yew...!</em>"</p>
<p>Zuo's father: "<em>Zuo! You made it back...</em>" Most closed their eyes and dropped their head down. Some covered their face as tears shed.</p>
<p>Cyma: "<em>Heewa... You always kept such good care of this... Now look at it... I just wish that... <strong>we could have talked more</strong>...{{footnote: Don't wait till it's too late, guys and gals!}} But... you're home now.</em>"</p>
<p>On the other side, Monica, after watching their reminiscent for a moment, turned to the group, "Thanks to you... these people got a chance to say farewell <em>to their loved ones.</em> And I got to fulfill <em>Dad's dying wish. Thank you.</em>"</p>
<p>Then, Noah brought out his flute. Mio was attracted to his action. Looking appreciatively, he turned to ask Mio whether she wanted to join by looking at each other's eyes, and she nodded back.</p>
<p>And so they went somewhere nearer to the memorial stone, a little bit farther from where the group stood, and started playing the melody together. Some of those whom lost their loved ones huddled together, embracing each other for support. Others more steel-hearted got to withstand it themselves, at least on the exterior.</p>
<p>"Hoh!" Lanz's eyes wide opened as he started seeing motes arising from their belongings! That was impossible! They weren't even corpses, how could motes rise from them?</p>
<p>Sena wasn't less surprised, "The motes..."</p>
<p>Manana: "Sparkles fly..."</p>
<p>Mio and Noah looked at each other, surprised too, but they still had their hobbies to be done. No attention to stop before they finish.</p>
<p>(Mei?:) "You're finally home..."</p>
<p>"<em>Heewa...</em>" And seeing the motes, the group could no longer retain their tears.</p>
<p>Monica walked forward to comment, attracting their attention, "These people, they weren't just sacrifices. They've entrusted us all <em>with the future.</em> As the Founders did. <strong><em>Looking back... is not, an option.</em></strong>" They watched as the motes rose for the final time. As no one's attention was on her, even Monica quietly shed tears, repressing it quietly. Her dad wasn't just the previous city leader, after all.</p>
<hr />
<p>After the people leave, only the group, Monica, and Travis left. Monica: "So that was an off-seeing... The sound of that music... It's really something else. I don't think anyone here will forget this day, as looong as they live." Noah and Mio looked at each other.</p>
<p>Travis: "The fallen never got to win their battles. But maybe now, <em>they can get some rest.</em>"</p>
<p>Monica: "<em>Yeah... finally...</em>" Then, she turned to Travis, "Speaking of, you ought to <em>get some rest too</em>. You're gonna be pretty busy <em>from now on</em>."</p>
<p>"You said it, Boss." As if his mind realized slowly, "<strong>W-wait...</strong> Just- how busy are we talking here?"</p>
<p>"From now on, <em>I'll be traveling with Noah's crew.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Huh?! But... then, who's going to handle things in the City?</strong>" His speech sped up as his heart raced.</p>
<p>"You'll be here, won't you, Travis?"</p>
<p>His chin wobbles, awestruck. Not that he could change her mind, "<em>Ugh... Like father, like daughter, eh?</em>"</p>
<p>"Dad spent his life on the front line. And I want to carry on that tradition.{{footnote: Turning to the group.}} I understood that when I heard the off-seers play. It <strong>has</strong> to be me. I <strong>have</strong> to carry on his legacy, fulfill his hopes. I'll fight for you now. Call on me anytime you need my help."</p>
<p>Noah: "Thank you. That's truly heartening."</p>
<p>Mio thought for a while before commenting, "I hope we'll get to know each other outside of battle, too. There's so much I'd like to ask you... About yourself, the City..."</p>
<p>"No worries."</p>
<p>"A word of warning, guys. The boss's stories... are looooong."</p>
<p>"<strong>If you've got time to rip on the boss, I might just assign you some more duties, Travis.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Duh!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Well, at least I won't have to worry about the City <em>while I'm gone.</em> Just holler if you need me."</p>
<p>Noah: "We'll take you up on that." And she nodded back in return.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the others, 'Teach' is not a character that comes online. But because he's 'Teach', he 'teaches'. He's the commander of one of the two colonies that co-joined forces when taking down Guernica. It was Mio, Taion, and Sena's colony before they became Ouroboros. Taking him in lets you understand their original colony more. We have two videos associated with Teach, but we'll only write about the first. The second is more about Teach in depth, while for this, we'll introduce you to the Agnian's original colony.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The group were walking on the field covered with red grass {{footnote: Where they first became Ouroboros.}} when they saw fighting in the distance between Kevesi and Agnians. Noah alerted the group, "Look!"</p>
<p>Sena looked closer and got nervous, "<strong>Oh! Mimi! That's Kyrie from Colony Gamma!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What?!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Friend of yours?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes... But the story will have to wait.</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah agreed with her, "OK! Let's give her a hand!"</p>
<hr />
<p>After defeating the Kevesi, Mio questioned Kyrie, "<strong>You OK? You're not hurt?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>MI-...</strong>"</p>
<p>"Kyrie?"</p>
<p>"<strong>MIOOOOOO!!! You're in one piece?! Thank you so much for saving me! I'm so glad you're alive!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion calmly spoke, "Yes, yes, no need to get so excited."</p>
<p>"<strong>AHHHH, I'm so sorry! I'll calm down! Deep breaths...</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "What are you doing here, Kyrie? Colony Gamma is-"</p>
<p>"Oh! Well, actually..." And she looked down the bottom left.</p>
<p>She folded her arm, "... You got separated from your unit <em>again</em>?" Oops, looks like that's not the first time!</p>
<p>Shamefully, "I'm so sorry! I just have no sense of direction at all!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Never change, Kyrie!"</p>
<p>At the back whom let the Agnian reunite, Noah: "She's... <em>interesting, isn't she?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz thought the word not good description, "Interesting, a pain in the neck... <em>Same difference</em>, I s'pose."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyrie noticed these Kevesi speaking, "Sooooo, Mio, those other people...?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry about them. They're my friends. And they helped save you."</p>
<p>"Ah, so they did! Thanks again, Mio." Such big hearts, or maybe, she just trusted Mio unconditionally.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Why 'thanks Mio'?! What are the rest of us, Armu steak?!"</p>
<p>Sena and Mio turned to her, while Sena explained, "Leave it, that's just Kyrie." And she just shook her head.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kyrie was whispering, "<em>Mio, let's hurry back to the colony! I bet the commander will be pleased to see you too!</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, about that... Can I have a quick word?"</p>
<p>"Of course! What about?!"</p>
<p>"This is an odd question, but... Well. How do we look to you?"</p>
<p>Taion remembered, "Ah...!"</p>
<p>"How do you... look? Well, let me see..." She turned his head and scanned Taion, then Sena, then Manana, then back at Mio, whom had hoped for the best. "Ah-HA!"</p>
<p>"Hm?"</p>
<p>"Yep, no good at all! You can't just change your clothes as you please! That's against regulations! Hmm, but they suit you so perfectly! I mean, your off-seer outfit suited you to a T as well, but I mean..."</p>
<p>With her machine gun speed speaking, Mio cut her off, "<em>Thanks, Kyrie, that's all I needed.</em>"</p>
<p>"Happy to help!"</p>
<p>"I just need to discuss <em>something</em> with everyone. Mind waiting?"</p>
<p>"No problem!"</p>
<p>And they turned around and joined the Kevesi waiting behind. Mio announced, "She seems in her right mind, anyway. No glowing Iris."</p>
<p>Sena: "Just classic Kyrie."</p>
<p>Taion thought more, "But does this mean we don't look like hostiles <em>to everyone...?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Let's not worry about that for now. <em>What should we do with her?</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>That's the question.</em> I want to take her back to the colony if we can... But can we?"</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>We can't send her out on her own. It's dangerous, and she'd definitely get lost again...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Fine with me, but would she be OK hanging out with us Kevesi?"</p>
<p>Mio thought for a while, "It's possible that the commander of Colony Gamma <em>would</em> hear us out. At least, he isn't the type to turn around and capture people without warning."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Can we trust him?"</p>
<p>Even Taion upvoted, "<em>Better than the Consul.</em> Trust me on that."</p>
<p>Noah: "If both of you are willing to go that far, then he seems worth meeting."</p>
<p>Mio: "Thank you. If anything happens, I'll do <em>everything</em> I can to keep you all safe, I promise." And she turned around and approached her after the decision's made, "Thanks for waiting. Let's go, Kyrie."</p>
<p>"Ready, Mio!"</p>
<hr />
<p>A giant Ferronis lurched between two cliff, its hands curved in a way like embracing its 'kids' within itself, and it had a facial feature of eyes and mouth on its belly, making it look as if it was perching from the ground. Not all buildings fits inside its coverings, though. They had finally arrived at the empty-looking colony.</p>
<p>Kyrie turned to Mio, "Wait here! <strong>I'll go ahead and tell everyone!</strong>" And before Mio could reply, she was too excitedly dashing off into the colony.</p>
<p>"<strong>No, Kyrie! Just wait-!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion already put his hand on his forehead, knowing the tragedy will happen. And it did.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey, guys! Mio's come back! Taion and Sena, too!</strong>" And Mio, seeing it too late, just shook her head. Nothing they could do except entering the base slowly.</p>
<p>"Welcome back!"</p>
<p>"We were so worried about you guys!" Agnians can be seen running towards the great news bringer. And so the Agnians (including Manana) greeted each other.</p>
<p>"Good job sticking it out, Sena. We were pretty sure you were dead." Said someone with a crystal horn.</p>
<p>"Foots... Why do you have to be so snarky about everything?" Complaint someone with a dog paw on her face and biceps. And Sena? She just scratched her head.</p>
<p>"All of you... I'm so glad you're OK." A thick gray-green hair guy wearing glasses met Taion.</p>
<p>"Mio... It's been so long." A light turquoise iris girl held Mio's hands appreciatively.</p>
<p>And behind were the Kevesi's. Noah was smiling. "Urg hmph..." Eunie snuffed her nose to quiet herself.</p>
<p>Lanz, hearing the sound she made, looked to her in question teasingly, "Hm? Wait, are those actual tears? Eunie?"</p>
<p>"Hngh... Snuff it, you big dummy."</p>
<p>Just then, someone walked in from behind. Kyrie, standing behind Mio, saw his approach, "<strong>Oh, there you are, Teach!</strong>" And the rest of the Agnian formerly greeting them ran back, while Sena and Taion did the Agnian welcoming stance. Mio followed thereafter. The other soldiers stood on both sides doing it too, giving a central alleyway for him to walk through and approached Mio and the others.</p>
<p>Dark jacket with pointed edge at the bottom side, white boots, wearing dark blue armor, pale gray-green skin, pointed ears, beige (relatively) short hair, and small emerald iris, and something like an emerald crystal covered by a strand of hair on his right, whom welcomed Mio back. "Mio, Sena, Taion. You're... It's- wonderful to see you again."</p>
<p>Mio: "I'm truly sorry, Commander Teach. We never meant to-"</p>
<p>And he held out his palm to stop her. "<em>The details</em> can wait till later. I'm sure you'd appreciate a rest, no? I imagine getting here was... <em>by no means a simple task.</em> Am I right?"</p>
<p>"...Yes. We appreciate your concern."</p>
<p>Then, peering behind her shoulder, "And as for our visitors here... We can make our introductions later."</p>
<p>"<em>Mm</em>." Noah agreed facelessly. Mio peered behind to look at the Kevesi, and turn to look at Teach, haven't sensed anything not right yet.</p>
<p>"Well then." And he turned around to return to his post, probably, showing no sign of being an enemy to the group.</p>
<hr />
<p>Still outside, the same location as before, after Teach and the overly-excited soldiers left. Noah: "He was kind of strange. Quiet, <em>but I could feel something threatening in him...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, are you sure about this? He didn't even question us."</p>
<p>Taion: "Perhaps he's already worked it out. Decided, we're not hostile."</p>
<p>Lanz saw the results, "Well, no one's attacked us. Which is more than we can say for... pretty much <strong>every</strong> other time."</p>
<p>Sena had a plan, "Mimi, once we're rested up, how about we tour the colony?"</p>
<p>"Good idea. I wanna see how everyone's doing."</p>
<p>Excitedly, "And we can show the Kevesi folks around while we're at it." Being a host, eh!</p>
<p>Eunie agreed with that, "Much obliged. We are just visitors, after all."</p>
<p>Taion announced, "I want to have a chat with the soldiers too. There are a couple of things I'm curious to know."</p>
<p>Noah: "So this is your old colony, Mio... Let's see what kind of place it is."</p>
<hr />
<p>Seated at the canteen, one of the facilities not 'shielded' by the arms of the Ferronis, Sena commented, "Looks like our friends are doing just fine, Mimi."</p>
<p>"Seems so..." Her tone was low and down.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Still, there's a lot fewer soldiers here than I expected."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>Taion: "A lot of the soldiers employed on that mission <em>haven't come back yet</em>. No one knows what became of them."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>The mission where we became Ouroboros, yeah?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>I daresay that's the one...</em>"</p>
<p>The group were looking down as the mood turned darker, and a long pause ensued, until Eunie apologized suddenly, "...<em>Sorry. Should've kept my mouth shut.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "No, you didn't do anything wrong, Eunie."</p>
<p>Taion noticed that "<em>All the soldiers left in the colony are newbies, with no combat experience.</em> Right now, they've been ordered to stand by as a reserve force. Far from the front lines."</p>
<p>"A good thing, too. That's what saved Kyrie and others' lives. Plus, they didn't get to learn the truth about us, and the world... But..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ugh... It doesn't sit well with me to pretend like everything's fine, though..."</p>
<p>Noah thought for a while before asking, "...Mio, would you mind talking to this commander of yours, Teach?"</p>
<p>"About what?"</p>
<p>"Everything. Tell him thanks for taking us in no questions asked."</p>
<p>Taion: "Now look. I know I sad he was trustworthy, but-"</p>
<p>"No, Noah's right." Mio didn't need the 'but' to make decisions. "I was planning on telling him everything anyway, and if we're gonna talk, we may as well lay it all out sooner than later. We can't just expect people to trust us while we hide the truth like this."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah. Makes more sense than staying and hiding."</p>
<p>"<em>Hngh</em>, Right."</p>
<p>Sena had her hopes high, "<em>The commander will understand, I know it.</em> He's crazy harsh, but crazy fair, too."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Harsh? He didn't look it."</p>
<p>Taion: "... Sometimes ignorance <em>is bliss</em>."</p>
<p>"Pfft..."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside Commander Teach's tent. He had been waiting for them. "Ah, how is everything? If you still need to rest, then-"</p>
<p>Mio, with a heavy lung, "Commander... there's something else, I'd like to discuss with you."</p>
<p>"Of course! You don't look like you've come to <em>just deliver a report.</em>" Standing, up, he asked, "Then, shall we relocate? <em>That should be more convenient for you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes, that would be helpful, thank you."</p>
<p>And he thought for a while what place would be nice. "Ah, yes. I know a good place nearby. Let's talk there."</p>
<p>And she took a step back, had a feeling that something <strong>not</strong> right is about to happen, "<strong>What?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion, whom had experienced such history too, started feeling agitated, "C-C-Commander, please! We don't need to go th-"</p>
<p>"It has a beautiful view, and a particular... <strong>peacefulness</strong> <em>about it.</em>" Finish, finish!</p>
<p>Sena was still losing her mind, "<strong>How lovely! I'd love to see it!</strong>" And Mio and Taion turned to her and gave her a wide eyes look at her innocence.</p>
<p>Taion put his hand on his head, "...<em>This is bad.</em> This is all going south."</p>
<p>Noah and the others hadn't yet know what was about to happen to them, "It's just a change of place. I don't get what the problem is."</p>
<p>Mio, seeing change is no longer possible, "<em>Urgh... We'll regret this.</em>"</p>
<p>Teach shook his head, "I'd rather not delay, but unfortunately I have some work left to do here. Wait for me next to the training ground. I'll meet you as soon as I can."</p>
<p>"Urgh... Very well. We'll see you there." And she did the welcoming stance, and they turned to leave.</p>
<p>After they leave, he quietly spoke to the wall, "<em>They were outstanding soldiers.</em> I'd go so far as to say they were the pride of Agnus. <em>So,... now they're traitors.</em> People are mysteries. You can never really understand them. Don't you agree?"</p>
<p>There stood the before-not-seen Consul where he faced. (S)He didn't reply.</p>
<p>Teach therefore continued, "<em>But... I'm the commander</em>. I can't let my personal feelings get in the way of my duty. <strong>I will deal with them</strong>. You can leave the matter with me." And he turned away, <em>his eyes insistent</em>, "We can't afford to ignore anything that might do our very world harm."</p>
<hr />
<p>After Teach finished his work, he found the chatting group by the rendezvous point. "Sorry, to have kept you waiting. So, shall we head out?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah! So is this 'good place' of yours far?"</p>
<p>"Hmmm... I'd say reasonably near. But, the road is poorly maintained and slopes a lot. It might not be an easy journey."</p>
<p>Shaking her head, Eunie can sense, "Oh great, now I'm totally sold."</p>
<p>"It all depends on how you walk it. <strong>Once you get the hang of it</strong>, it's just like strolling through a field of flowers. <strong>If you don't mind</strong>, I can explain on the way."</p>
<p>Noah: "Well, in that case..."</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>Sounds great!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion just shook his head. And Mio repeating the important phrase the others didn't catch: "...if it's reasonably close by."</p>
<p>Taion: "We'd better get ready."</p>
<hr />
<p>After some traveling, they reached a slope where quicksand rolled down the slope. Teach: "Right. <strong>This</strong>, is where it gets real. First, imagine a stake." That kept the group thinking as he continued, "The stake is hammered into the ground. <strong>So deep</strong>, that it becomes one, with the earth. Now take that feeling, and <strong>that's</strong> how you're going to take each step. Your feet, are the stakes, in this case."</p>
<p>Noah: "Ummmm... I guess... I...? No, I d-don't get it."</p>
<p>"That's all you need to know for now. You'll pick the rest up as you go."</p>
<hr />
<p>Looks like they'd successfully understood his teachings! Sena still had the strength to walk beside Teach, with Lanz following some distance behind, closely followed by Mio, then Eunie and Noah some distance away, with Riku and Manana just behind. Taion dropped far behind. Riku and Manana stopped and turned around, make sure that he'd catch up. There was a waterfall beside a campfire to be seen.</p>
<p>Lanz was already panting quite badly, "Hah... Hah... Are we... Hah Are we there yet...?"</p>
<p>Teach, hearing his question, stopped to answer, "About halfway now. <strong>Not long</strong> to go."{{footnote: LOL}}</p>
<p>Eunie, too tired to speak without stuttering, "We have... very different ideas... of what <em>'not long' means</em>..." And she dropped her head down.</p>
<p>Sena was still energetic, "<strong>COME ON, PEOPLE!!! This is why you need to lift more weights!</strong>"</p>
<p>Teach: "<strong>Sena, you know you can't</strong> hone your endurance just by lifting weights."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, are you sure?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>The key to training is working the whole body, rather than focusing too much on any one exercise.</em></strong> I'm sure it's not a problem now, but keep it up and you'll wear yourself out."</p>
<p>"Ohhhh, wow, I see!"</p>
<p>"<em>Hmm...</em>, not good though. <strong>I believe I already taught you this</strong> in the past."</p>
<p>"<strong>Gah!!!</strong> I'm... sorry..."</p>
<p>Lanz, teasingly teased, "Look at you, all calm and cool..."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Because I train properly." In the background, looks like there's another quicksand to get up.</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Hah...</em> This is harder than I <strong>expected</strong>."</p>
<p>Mio turned around, "<em>I said</em> we'd regret this." And he could just look up at the sky and shook his head, thinking why the heck had they gone through this torture, now that it's too late.</p>
<p>Taion, from behind, already knees on the ground, "The commander is also the colony's instructor, after all. He seems mild-mannered enough at first glance. But new recruits are... <strong>terrified</strong> of him. They'd rather face a battle than his wrath."</p>
<p>Noah then walked to him, "Huh... Hm? Taion, are you OK?"</p>
<p>Teach: "You shouldn't slack off on your training <em>just because you've seen real battle. <strong>Whether you live or die on the battlefield is determined by how you face it</strong>. That's where it ends... Excuse me. I didn't mean to lecture.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio walked nearer to him to speak, "You never changed, Commander."</p>
<p>"<em>Ahhhhh, don't embarrass me.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "You really do come across as an instructor." Taion had already stood back up after recuperating.</p>
<p>"Hmhmhm, I'll take that as a compliment."</p>
<p>"It's pretty unusual for a commander to be an instructor as well, though."</p>
<p>"Probably... <strong>In my case</strong>... Well, there's... a lot going on."</p>
<p>Mio: "What'd you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"<em>Just what I said.</em> Anyway, break time's over. Let's crack on." Not something he's willing to speak out yet.</p>
<p>Lanz just threw his hands into the air, "<em>Don't say</em> <strong>thaaaaatttt...</strong>" Only Sena can catch up with him.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group reached the top of the jaw-shaped peak that stretches out into the clear blue sky. Surprisingly, at such height, grass still grows lush green.{{footnote: Alexander von Humboldt had drawn a picture with a name one forgot that shows, at different height, different plants grow; and at very tall height, due to temperature and oxygen lacking, almost no plants grow}}.</p>
<p>Mio, her eyes wide opened with awe, "This is..."</p>
<p>Such beautiful scenery they had seldom seen. In the near distance, we saw other jaw-shaped peak and thorn-shape peaked, perhaps slightly higher than their current location. Very far away was the mountain they visited the queen, much taller than their current location. Birds flew past not far away.</p>
<p>Teach: "<strong>What do you think?</strong> A good place, isn't it? It's peaceful, invigorating. A place to quiet your mind. Even the war between Agnus and Keves feels a world away from here, <em>doesn't it?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes... it does."</p>
<p>He wasn't facing Mio but the scenery. "I assume you know about the state of Colony Gamma."</p>
<p>"Y-yes. That's actually what I wanted to-..."</p>
<p>"Then I can tell you that <em>you don't have to, Mio</em>."</p>
<p>"What do you-...?"</p>
<p>"<em>Don't you get it yet?</em>" And he turned around, "<strong>I mean</strong> that I'm going to deal with you <strong>here</strong> and <em>now</em>."</p>
<p>And Noah and Eunie and Taion immediately get defensive, with Noah shocked, "<strong>Wha...? But you...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Purging the traitor Ouroboros from our ranks is a matter of the <strong>highest</strong> priority. <strong>I am the commander of Colony Gamma</strong>, I cannot shirk this duty. <strong>Do you understand?</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie's voiced like biting her tongue, "What, that you lured us out here to do us in? Yeah, I'm up to speed, thanks."</p>
<p>"No one in the colony will learn <em>what you are.</em> <strong>Understand that the fact I'm not doing this in public</strong> is a sign of my respect <em>for you.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio still tried to persuade, "But, Commander, wait! <strong>Please, just listen-!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What would be the point</strong>? Words blur truth and <em>lies so easily</em>."</p>
<p>Taion: "Commander...!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Ugh, we've got no choice...!" And the Kevesi already summoned their blades.</p>
<p>"Are you prepared? Face your deaths with honor." And he called his weapon, a stick with burning torches on both ends.</p>
<p>Mio, closing her eyes, perhaps felt regret that she didn't manage to convince one whom she thought would had least listen to her, finally summoned her blades, followed by Sena and Taion.</p>
<p>"The time has come."</p>
<hr />
<p>After some battling, Lanz complaint, "Spark's sake! We can't take him down and he's just- one- guy?"</p>
<p>Taion: "I knew he had stamina, but <strong>this is</strong>...!"</p>
<p>"<strong>You too display impressive power. But it's that power which is the cause of everything that's gone wrong</strong>, threatening the lives of others <em>as well as yourselves.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio sheathed her blade as she tried to continued her convincing, "N-no, you've got it wrong! We-!"</p>
<p>"<strong>No. This isn't just something that only concerns you.</strong>" And he also sheathed his blade. Is the fight going to continue? And he turned around to look at the world, the direction of the great sword, "<strong>This power is a</strong> maelstrom that surrounds the world. <strong>A maelstrom, eventually becomes a raging torrent that swallows lives with-out mer-cy.</strong>" Turning back to them, "<strong>If you really know what's going on in Colony Gamma</strong>, then you <em>must</em> understand <em>this</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>That's...</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>So, tell me,</strong> Mio. Was it the power of becoming an Ouroboros that drove you to the other side? <strong>Were you reduced to merely one part of a maelstrom?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>No, you're wrong!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>And what precisely am I wrong a-bout?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>We became Ouroboros by</strong> pure chance. <strong>But we thought that with such power we'd be able to do more.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Hah!</strong> Do what?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Keep the world alive. Find new ways to use our lives for-... I don't know. I can't</strong> put it into words. <strong>But that's what we want to use it for. That's all I'm sure of.</strong>"{{footnote: As of "How to Read a Book" by Mortimer Adler, if you can't put it into words, you don't understand what you're talking/writing about. If something is so clear you know what you're speaking/doing/writing, putting it into words is as easy as drinking water in your 'mother tongue' (which isn't the tongue of your parents, but one mean the <em>first</em> language you learn as a baby to communicate, and expand it with sufficient basic vocabulary. E.g. if you're a Chinese, but your family first taught you English as a baby, then English is your mother tongue, despite you're a Chinese. [This is very common in Southeast Asia, btw. Nowadays, Chinese parents don't necessarily teach their children Chinese to begin with, nor even sending them to a school that teach one.]) }}</p>
<p>And he shook his head. You don't even know what you're talking about except "<strong>Very pretty words.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>We can only... we can only go forward. We want to find a way that doesn't involve</strong> sacrificing lives." Now, seeing the fight isn't continuing, the others finally sheathed their blades.</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"<em>Hurrr....</em>"</p>
<p>"Hrr... <strong>Looks</strong> like I've misjudged."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Well</strong>, you've heard for yourself. I- don't- believe they are traitors. <strong>In my capacity as commander</strong>, I judge them <strong>not</strong> deserving of death. Are you in <strong>agreement</strong>, Consul?"</p>
<p>Noah: "The Consul's here?" And he/she teleported in from behind, making a teleporting sound that attracted the group's attention.</p>
<p>Sena: "<strong>AHHHH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>So this is</strong> where you were hiding!"</p>
<p>And he, consul G, just folded his arms, "What a <em>lovely fiction</em>. <strong>Bravo</strong>. The fact <em>remains</em>, Ouroboros will <strong>destroy</strong> the world."</p>
<p>Teach: "But that's just <strong>one</strong> possibility. Still, people <strong>can</strong> change. I <strong>choose</strong> to believe them."</p>
<p>"Like the old you...?"</p>
<p>And his head dropped. "<em>Yes.</em> I had no will, no resolution. <em>Only shame.</em> But they aren't me. They will walk a different path."</p>
<p>"You, shall persist, no matter what?"</p>
<p>"You gave me a chance to fix it. I have an obligation. <em>So let's stop doing things your way. Let's end that here.</em>"</p>
<p>"...Very well. Then I shall make <strong>you</strong> and the traitors <strong>recant</strong> your folly." And he transformed, "...with the power of Moebius!"</p>
<p>Teach walked in front to do the fighting, Mio calling out, "Commander...!"</p>
<p>He therefore said, "Right, you lot. <strong>Time to walk the walk. Prove that this power leads to light!</strong>"</p>
<p>And after a short pause, "<strong>We will!</strong>" And they summoned their blades to join the fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>After destroying the Moebius (or maybe it has escaped? We don't know), there was a moment of pause when Teach was sorting out things in his head, not looking at the guys and gals, and the others waited for him... "<em>Hrrr</em>..."</p>
<p>"<em>Hrrr...</em> Commander, we..."</p>
<p>"...Not yet, Mio."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"<em>It's not over yet.</em>" And he turned around, 'remind' them, "There's <strong>one thing</strong> you still have to do. Isn't there?"</p>
<p>And she knew what he meant. "...There is."</p>
<p>"Let's go back to the colony, and decide our next steps from there."</p>
<hr />
<p>In front of the Colony's Flame Clock, Mio, Noah, and Teach watched it for the last time while it burns. The two turned to look at Teach, asking for his permission. And he nodded thereafter. Both exchanged glance, "Here we go," and smashed it into pieces. One shard of it fell under gravity and crashed into the ground below, sending dirt splashing few meters high.</p>
<hr />
<p>The group were back, gathering in a half-circle around Teach. Mio: "Commander... You knew from the start."</p>
<p>"Not. At. All. I was <strong>serious</strong>, Mio. I was ready to <strong>die</strong> to take you down."</p>
<p>Noah: "So what you mean is, you were <strong>testing</strong> us?"</p>
<p>And he lowered glance, explained, "<em>Such power can drive people mad.</em> I needed to be sure about you. I needed to know you hadn't fallen into the trap of being <strong>enthralled</strong> by power, <strong>that you had retained</strong> your own will."</p>
<p>Lanz threw his hands up in the air, "So that's why you had to try to <strong>kill</strong> us for real?"</p>
<p>"Determining the true nature of power is a kind of power in itself. <em>That's how I do things.</em>"</p>
<p>Shaking his head in unacceptance of his standing, "<strong>You're... surprisingly</strong> violent."</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>But just one slip and you'd be...</em>"</p>
<p>And he shook his head, dropped his head, thinking of how to phrase his words, "I... once got to see how power can destroy a person <em>up close</em>. I knew a soldier who was lost in it, and lost to it. <em>I don't want to see that happen to you. Nor does anyone in the colony.</em> It was... no choice at all to put my <em>life on the line to prevent it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Hurrr..."</p>
<p>Taion agreed with him, "You're right that being an Ouroboros comes with huge power, but it's full of danger too."</p>
<p>Sena self-convinced, "Yeah, but... we're fine? We use it right, so..." But the rest were thinking and recalling whether they really did use their powers correctly so far.</p>
<p>"...<em>The reason I became an instructor was to teach people how to confront power.</em>  But... there was always a niggling <em>doubt at the back of my mind.</em> That people are, at heart, stupid creatures that power makes a <strong>mockery</strong> of."</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>That's...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>But</em>, if you were to ask me whether I still thought that way, <em>I'd say no.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion therefore asked, "So you have hope?"</p>
<p>"I do. Hmph...Now that I've crossed Blades with you, I understand. So... <strong>the maelstrom hasn't become a raging torrent</strong>, <em>but a clear, strong current</em>."</p>
<p>Mio invited, "Commander, if that's what you think, then I'd like you to come with us."</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh!!? And...</strong> may I ask why?"</p>
<p>"I want you to see with your own eyes... that your faith in us isn't misplaced. You want something from us. More than just words, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. <strong><em>The stream becomes the flow of life itself</em></strong>, bringing <em>change</em> and <em>upheaval</em> to the world... And you want me to be the one to watch over your futures. That's it, <em>isn't it?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yes. Well, something like that."</p>
<p>"<em>Hmph...</em>" And after he considered for a while, he replied, "OK then. I'll do it. I accept the job. But... what have those of you from Keves to say <em>on this matter?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Yes, of course."</p>
<p>Lanz: "The more the merrier, especially <em>if they're as strong as you.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Fine by me. Assuming we never have to fight it out like this again."</p>
<p>"<strong>WELL</strong>, that all depends on how well you <strong>train</strong>, doesn't it?" And everyone was so scared of the word 'train' they all took a step back.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Ugh, why?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HAHAHAH, I was only joking ha ha...</strong> Ahh, before I forget, <strong>Mio</strong>. I'd like to ask you a favor <em>in return for this.</em>"</p>
<p>"Anything."</p>
<p>"<em>Thank you.</em> I'll run through the particulars later." And looking up, he was reminded, "<strong>Oh, wait.</strong> I actually know a very good place for talking. It's just-"</p>
<p>Mio was so scared of the 'very good place' that she had to cut nervously, "<strong>Yea-Yeah, I think I'll pass on that part...</strong>" The others were also nervous hearing that word.</p>

<p>The group were traversing along a wind-blowing meadow in a crevasse when someone sliced a sword "Qi" at them.</p>
<p>Lanz first sensed the incoming attack, shouted "<strong>Noah!!</strong>", and immediately got in front and raised his shield.</p>
<p>"Got you!" Noah dashed past after he blocked the first attack and slashed at the shield. It leaves a crack in the shield, but was quickly recovered as the shield regenerates itself.</p>
<p>"Well coordinated, but ineffective." And he raised his sword into the air to ready for another slash.</p>
<p>Eunie recognized the guy attacking them, "Hey, it's you!"</p>
<p>Noah: "Oh no!" The slash broke Noah's sword; it returned to his Iris.</p>
<p>Lanz: "Spark's sake... <strong>Zeon!</strong>" He quickly dashed to bash at Zeon. After blocking, he made another slash that forced Lanz's blade to sheathe. Lanz quickly recalled his weapon to face Zeon, currently alone.</p>
<p>Zeon, with a blonde scruffy hair over his forehead, and wings that were similar color to his hair, pale skin, turquoise iris, and thin grey eyebrow. He was of average size, just like Noah, not buff-looking like Lanz. He wore a Kevesi armor, wielded a sword on his right hand and a shield on his left. He was clearly disappointed, "You lose yourself to emotion. Some special forces you are."</p>
<p>"<strong>You shut your trap</strong>. What a <strong>joke!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You consider me the joke, do you? <em>Really now?</em>"</p>
<p>With Noah pointing his sword at Zeon, Mio, whom stood beside him, questioned, "Hey, isn't he...?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. He's our friend, from Colony 9."</p>
<p>Zeon overheard: "That's where you're wrong. You're traitors... You're no friends of mine!" And he blew away Lanz.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Zeon, just listen! We don't want to-"</p>
<p>Taion: "Drop it, Eunie. Negotiation doesn't appear to be on the table." Other Kevesi soldiers were approaching Zeon to help him. All therefore called their blades to join the unavoidable battle.</p>
<p>"Mimi..."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Not her to decide, but Noah and Zeon.</p>
<p>Zeon: "Arrest the turncoats!" And the other Kevesi soldiers obeyed his order, withdrew their weapons.</p>
<p>Noah: "So we have to fight...?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Halfway through the fight, a Colony 9 soldier called Zeon, "Commander, please respond!"</p>
<p>Zeon and his group sheathed their weapons to get in touch with their Iris, "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Enemy attack! Agnian forces!</strong>" The other soldiers looked at each other turned to him, waiting for his final decision.</p>
<p>On the other side, Sena "Wonder what's going on..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Hmph..."</p>
<p>The buff guy to Zeon's right, with brown hair and pale skin and huge nose, called Roald, "...Commander?"</p>
<p>"Yes... Ah, I'm thinking."</p>
<p>Lanz and Noah sheathed their blade, with Lanz feeling surprised, questioned, "Hey, what did ya just say? Zeon's the <strong>commander</strong> now?"</p>
<p>Eunie{{footnote: Nope, not yet sheathed her blade.}}: "Does that mean the old one...?"</p>
<p>The guy behind Zeon of normal size and pale skin, called Fox, answered their questions, "There was a change of command! Someone had to take the fall for the traitors."</p>
<p>And the woman with short hair to the right, Eilis, added, "They even dropped our colony rank... We've been so pressed for food, we had to venture out this far... All because of you."</p>
<p>Sheathed her blade, Eunie felt awful, "...<em>Well, crap.</em>"</p>
<p>Fox urged Zeon, "Go back. We'll take care of things here."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "I can't allow that."</p>
<p>"Just get going already!"</p>
<p>Noah: "The Agnian battalion. They're using terrain to cover their approach. Am I right?"</p>
<p>Zeon: "How do you know that?"</p>
<p>Folding his arms, "I'm well aware that you don't trust me, I'm just speaking aloud here. We'll intercept the enemy troops, engage them while they're still advancing. They won't get their hands on the Colony. You retreat and shore up your defenses."</p>
<p>"What are you really after here? Why is it you're fighting?"</p>
<p>"We're both in very different positions now. But that doesn't have to mean everything's changed between us."</p>
<p>Fox voiced a snide remark, "Oh, well, done, a voice of reason. Come off it!"</p>
<p>Zeon: "Wait. Change of plans. We're bringing them back to the colony."</p>
<p>"<strong>What? Why?</strong>"</p>
<p>Roald hypothesized, "You're handling them to the Consul?"</p>
<p>"No... I'm integrating them into our force as the vanguard."</p>
<p>Eilis: "We're fighting <strong>with</strong> them?! Mwamba <strong>died</strong> because of them!"</p>
<p>"<strong>We're up against a whole battalion. Hardly the time</strong> for us to be picky. It's also possible that Ouroboros have instigated this attack themselves."</p>
<p>Lanz can't believe what he'd heard, "Ugh, you can't be serious!"</p>
<p>"You know exactly how serious I am."</p>
<p>"Fire and sparks..."</p>
<p>Eunie urged for him to calm down, "<em>Hold up. Let's do as he says.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What?</strong> Why should we?"</p>
<p>"<em>Just, play along! We'll be better able to help protect Colony 9 if we're part of the plan.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah turned to Mio and the others; they also agreed to join in. Then, he turned to convince "<em>Lanz...</em>"</p>
<p>Reluctantly, folding his arms and looking at the other side, he abide, "Tch. If you say so."</p>
<p>Zeon: "You have good friends."</p>
<p>But his tone wouldn't be friendly, "One day, I'm gonna crack that thick bonce of yours and really see what makes you <strong>tick</strong>..."</p>
<p>"I look forward to it." Turning to Roald, he gave instruction, "<strong>You lot head back</strong> and update Kite on the situation. I'll see to these ones. <strong>Meet me in command.</strong>"</p>
<p>After doing the Kevesi welcoming stance, "As you say."</p>
<p>Fox was not satisfied, "Hmph," so he turned his head away, seeing that he can't sway Zeon's decision. He took a walk, Eilis followed immediately after, and finally Roald.</p>
<p>Zeon turned back to Noah and the others, asked, "You said not everything's changed between us. Your words no longer have merit. <strong>So let's judge</strong> where your allegiance lies, by way of your actions."</p>
<p>Noah: "I understand. We won't let you down."</p>
<hr />
<p>In the evening, inside Zeon's office, with 3 male Kevesi's accompaniment, the group chatted with him. Fox was still feeling aggressive towards them, folding his arms as he gave snide comments, "I'm impressed. You didn't run away this time." Noah didn't reply.</p>
<p>Kite turned to Fox and Roald, "I'll explain what comes next. The rest of you are dismissed."</p>
<p>Roald bit his words: "Stay cool, Kite." Fox was annoyed.</p>
<p>"<strong>I'm always</strong> cool." And the two left, but kept locking their eyes at the group as they walked until they exited the room.</p>
<p>Zeon asked, "Tell us about Agnus's movements."</p>
<p>"Right now, they're assembling their forces on Everblight Plain. They've stopped concealing themselves, which feels like cause for concern enough."</p>
<p>He concluded, "They're confident they have the numbers for a full assault, then? Or perhaps it's a feint..."</p>
<p>"Or they're just a bunch of <strong>dolts</strong> who like <strong>pretending</strong> they have a plan, <strong>hahahahahahaha!</strong>"</p>
<p>"I'm not in the mood for jokes right now." He replied seriously.</p>
<p>"<strong>Hey, we need a little levity</strong> sometimes. With enough food, we can draw this out. Give the word and we could even launch a raid-..."</p>
<p>He shook his head, "I told you, that's not going to happen. <em>It would cost us too many lives.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>What then? Our troops are hungry, anxious, and quite frankly, more pissed off by the hour. You leave things like this, and we're going to fall apart by ourselves.</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "We could just remove their reason for fighting you."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Zeon urged "In plain language, please."</p>
<p>"If we smashed your Flame Clock, it would alter the equation."</p>
<p>"<strong>If you 'smashed it'</strong>!!!"</p>
<p>Kite: "<strong>Uhh, WHAT? Well now, I know you're all jokers!</strong>"</p>
<p>Riku rebut, "Kite biggest joker of all. <strong>This why Kite always runner-up in life. No one can take serious with hopeless second-best attitude!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Shut it, Riku! Y-you really know how to hit a man when he's down, don't you?</em> <strong>Why are you back here, anyhow? How'd you worm</strong> your way back into Zeon's favor?"</p>
<p>Riku got defensive and opened his arms, like a bird opened up its wings to make it look big to scare the enemy away, "<strong>Meh... No worming performed...</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>We don't <em>need</em> you here! I've had enough of seeing my friends die, betray me... I CAN'T deal with this DIRT any more!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>We feel</strong> just the same. Which is why we want to do as much as we possibly can to help. That's <em>why</em> we came back."</p>
<p>"Yeah, <strong>you're not</strong> <em>fooling</em> anybody."</p>
<p>Zeon disagreed, "You need not believe them; but they will prove to be an asset."</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH, SO THAT'S IT? You're siding with them in the end? You choose Noah over your own lieutenant? AGAIN?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's NOT what I'm saying.</strong>"</p>
<p>He turned around from facing him, blurted out, "<strong>DON'T YOU REALIZE HOW HARD I'M TRYING HERE? URGGGGHHHH!!! SPARK THIS!!!</strong>" And he just walked out of the room, unable to take it anymore.</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Sorry. I didn't mean to complicate matters.</em>"</p>
<p>Zeon: "<strong>On the contrary, was this not your intent?</strong> I would have thought you'd be <em>gloating</em> by now."</p>
<p>"We can gloat if it makes you feel better. But we can't just judge someone in the <em>heat of the moment.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Whatever you might think</strong>, suspicion will be cast upon you. <em>That is all I can say.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Suspicious or not, isn't it about time you tell us this plan of yours? You <strong>said</strong> we'd prove to be an asset."</p>
<p>"I'll continue. Though we have a geographical advantage, our provisions and numbers are limited. That's what the enemy will be banking on. And that's where <em>you</em> come in, as the vanguard."</p>
<p>Mio: "Our sudden appearance will put a spanner in their works, and that'll give you the edge you need, right?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Seeing Keves and Agnus bods fighting together and tearing up their front line's gonna throw 'em off their game, for sure."</p>
<p>Lanz scratched his head, "So we've gotta fight independently then. Better than being on a leash, I s'pose."</p>
<p>"You seem to misunderstand. I'm not cutting you loose... You're still being regarded as traitors. <strong>Keep in mind</strong> that I shall be supervising your <em>every. action</em>. personally."</p>
<p>"<strong>SIR YES SIR COMMANDER SIR.</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie just shook her head, "<em>Do you have to...?</em>"{{footnote: Think she meant Zeon's supervision, but it could also mean the heck Lanz react like that.}}</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>Let it go, guys.</em>"</p>
<p>"I'll send details of the operation to your Iris. The plan will commence at once."</p>
<p>"We're on it."</p>
<hr />
<p>"We'll be arriving presently." Zeon had took them through a valley, and we could see it opening up at the end.</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie, you OK?" He noticed she was looking around her.</p>
<p>"<em>Just feeling wistful... This is where we went looking for Fourtune Clovers, isn't it?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz recalled, "<strong>Oh yeah!</strong> You really made a big deal out of that."</p>
<p>"<em>Did not???!!! Just wanted to wish upon one.</em> All the others <em>laughed in my face, said I'd <strong>never</strong> find one here... Everyone but you guys, and Zeon. You must remember.</em>" They were in deep reminiscence. "<em>You're not the kind of guy who makes fun of people when they're trying their hardest.</em> You help people in need."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"<em>Listen.</em> I know you've been through all sorts of crap, but you don't know the whole story..."</p>
<p>"Oh I'm sure. Hmph, there is no such thing as a traitor who rebels, <em>without cause. Be it... Keves, or Agnus.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "<em>Hrrr...</em>"</p>
<p>"Hmph... You've sent, many of my comrades off, <em>Noah.</em> Time and time again, you saved the dead, helped survivors... <em>Even me.</em> I know, you do not make light of <em>people's lives.</em>"</p>
<p>"So you understand?"</p>
<p>He looked aside, "<em>I do.</em> But I can never be the friend to you, that I once was."</p>
<p>Lanz: "You don't give a cetri, do you?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I wasn't talking to you, Lanz.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>'Scuse me?</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Maybe we can't go back to the old days. But we can build something new."</p>
<p>"Leave your platitudes for after. <strong>The battlefield awaits.</strong>"</p>
<p>Nodding, "Don't worry, we'll win. No one's dying on our watch. Never again."</p>
<p>He thought for a second before turning back to their to-go direction, urged, "Time to move. Stay sharp."</p>
<hr />
<p>After moving through the valley, the group found the levnises parked in a short distance. Noah: "There's a lot of them... This'll be a battle of attrition. We can use the terrain for defensive advantage. First, we need to hurt their morale."</p>
<p>Taking advantage that the Agnians hadn't noticed them yet, Zeon urged, "Before that, we need to talk. <strong>I'll remain here</strong>, and fight for as long as I stand. That's... also part of the plan. It will be a grueling fight. I- won't- have time to be looking out for... possible deserters."</p>
<p>Eunie twitched her eyebrow, "Hold on, are you telling us to find a chance to escape?"</p>
<p>"<em>I never said that...</em> But this battle should be of little importance to you."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Sparks' sakes, Zeon... Just how rotten do you think we are?</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah folded his arms, "I see where you're coming from, but we're fighting on our own terms. We'll be seeing this through."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>We owe a debt, to Colony 9. Maybe it wasn't for very long but, it gave us somewhere to belong.</em>"</p>
<p>"But not any more..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>Just shut it, you! How hard is it</strong> for you to accept someone just wants to do a good deed, eh? <strong>Get a clue!</strong>" Zeon looked at him for a while while thinking how to reply him, but Lanz hadn't waited a moment, dashed off towards the Agnians before the others could react.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Lanz!"</p>
<p>Zeon: "How often does he need telling not to abandon himself to his feelings?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Have you given in?"</p>
<p>"Hah." He summoned his blades before continuing, "Still... Might as well strike while the iron's hot." And the rest summoned their blades after Lanz had lured them in!</p>
<hr />
<p>An Agnus soldier was scared, "<strong>What the spark are Ouroboros doing here? I did <em>not</em>, sign up for this!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz questioned, "Want us to run 'em down?"</p>
<p>Zeon: "We aren't here to kill each other. Pull back now, and we won't pursue you."</p>
<p>The Agnus Captain wasn't scared, calmly and slightly teasingly replied, "I'll bet you won't. <strong>Because you'll be dead!</strong>" As he finished, there were Agnian Levnises cruising high up in the air. They seemed to be traveling to the colony.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Levnises!"</p>
<p>Agnus Captain: "Always keep your ace in reserve. That's, how the game's played!"</p>
<p>"Ngh..."</p>
<p>Zeon: "Don't falter. We have Kite and the others holding the fort."</p>
<p>Noah: "Yeah. And we'll hold the line here, <strong>whatever it takes!</strong>" Second round.</p>
<hr />
<p>Agnus Captain: "Ur hrgg, urg hmm... I'm done..."</p>
<p>Another Agnus soldier to his left exclaimed, "Squad leader's been hit! <strong>PULL BACK!!!</strong>" And the soldiers sheathed their blades and withdrew themselves, leaving the Captain facing the group alone. Zeon watched as they leave the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Captain asked, "Why aren't you following them?"</p>
<p>Zeon sheathed his blades and explained, "I told you. I don't want needless slaughter."</p>
<p>"You're soft... rookie commander... Let me... tell you something." Zeon squinted his eyes, both ears readied. "You don't win wars while keeping your hands clean. You're gonna learn that... the hard way. You'll see..." And he committed suicide, cut his neck.</p>
<p>Seeing the danger's gone, the others sheathed their blades. Zeon softly commented, "<em>I guess we will...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Don't let it get to you."</p>
<p>"<em>I wouldn't normally but, in this instance</em>, I'm afraid he's struck a chord. I believe I said something similar to you in the past. We were... <em>sparring with training swords.</em>"</p>
<p>"You won, in the end."</p>
<p>"<em>I did. Because you always held back.</em>"</p>
<p>"That's not true."</p>
<p>"Hngh... You hated the very idea of fighting. <em>That's how it seemed to me.</em> And back then, I thought that you'd never survive with that <em>lofty ideal. I was blind.</em> <strong><em>If we don't stand for something greater, strife and conflict will grow ever fiercer.</em></strong> We would end up fighting not for the Flame Clock, but for our own bloodlust. That is who we are. <em>It was never going to be easy.</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah... I'm still trying to figure out what's right myself. But there's something I want to change. And to do that, I have to change myself."</p>
<p>"Hngh..." He checked his iris for the latest information from the colony, announced, "Kite and the others pulled through OK. <strong>It seems we've averted disaster</strong>, for now."</p>
<p>"Not quite. There's still unfinished business. Zeon, I want you to understand the things we've seen. The truth about the Flame Clocks. Just let us explain. After that, we'll let you have the final say."</p>
<p>"As you wish. It also <strong>saves us an awkward silence</strong> on the way back. But don't get your hopes up." Now that they had fought together, trust was up again, at least to the point of willingness to listen to each other.</p>
<p>"That's fine. Thank you."</p>
<p>"I'll round up everyone in the square. But first, to Colony 9." And that's a long way back.</p>
<hr />
<p>By the time they arrived, it was already nightfall and raining. The soldiers were waiting for their arrival, despite getting soaked standing outside. They saluted with the Kevesi welcoming stance as they group entered the base, all except Kite, whom had an extremely depressed look on his face. Before the group reacted, muted claps (due to wearing gloves) echoed so loud against the silence. The soldiers turned around to see who's coming. The Consul walked in between the rights of way they formed for him.</p>
<p>The group got defensive as the Consul approached, he said, "Our heroes return." He stopped some distance from the group. "Good work, Zeon."</p>
<p>"Where have you been?" He put his thumb and index finger under his chin.</p>
<p>"Just watching from the sidelines. <em>And I must say, it was quite a spectacle.</em>"</p>
<p>"Hmph. In what way?"</p>
<p>"Beg <em>pardon</em>. I forget! You drones have no aesthetic sense. Your droll skirmish <em>was one thing... It almost put me to sleep, but this here? Well, I'd say the colony is due a promotion.</em>"</p>
<p>"I recall no 'droll skirmish'."</p>
<p>"The one where these <strong>maggots</strong> surfaced! Loathsome little worms plotting together with Agnus, then deserting their duty like the <strong>cowards</strong> they are! <strong>Truly disgusting.</strong> A <em>disgrace</em> to the colony! And that goes for the ones who <em>croaked</em> for nothing too. Even calling that 'droll' is a disservice to the word!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>'Croaked for nothing'...?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "I know you see us as enemies... But this...?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>It's our friends you're talkin' about... Even Mwamba,... back then... How</em> <strong>DARE YOU?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>SILENCE, MAGGOTS!!!</strong> You must still be tired from fighting... <strong>Rejoice, then!</strong> You will give me great pleasure as I crush you!" And he kicked on the ground, sending a slash-like beam that swooshed at the group. The group raised their weapons to defend, but it was Zeon whom reacted the quickest, raised his shield at the center of impact. The attack got deflected sideways. The other soldiers gaped open their mouth, except a few (including Kite), at his courage to defy the Consul. "What do you think you're doing?!"</p>
<p>"The words of an idle man, who orders others around," and he pointed his sword at the Consul, "or the words of rebels who risked their lives for us. <strong>Which do you think is worth more?!</strong>" And he returned a slash beam at the Consul.</p>
<p>"<strong>SILENCE!</strong>" Without even twitching a finger, a bubble shield grew around him that blocked such attack. "This is insubordination!" Zeon and Noah exchanged glance through the tip of their eyes. Then, they heard the Consul jumping high up into the air and, with hands crossed, landed just in front of where they were standing, sending them flying into the air together with some rocks. After he landed, he kicked the rocks at the group. In mid-air, the group shielded such incoming boulders.</p>
<p>After he landed, Zeon dashed towards the Consul and pierced at him, which he easily dodged. Then, he blocked a hit from the Consul. A one-man show between Zeon and the Consul. The others were watching. "<strong>GO, NOAH!</strong>" He jumped up and pierced his sword on the floor, destroying the ground below while sending dust that obstruct the way of sights. The Consul kicked 360° to clear the dust.</p>
<p>"Where?" He could see the other Ouroboros, but not Zeon, Noah, and Mio. "<em>Stupid maggot!</em> Where did he-"</p>
<p>"Don't you realize?" Zeon was still beside him. We didn't see him just now. Then, he turned around to look at the Ferronis. Noah and Mio had launched themselves at the Flame Clock. It was too late for him to do anything. "The maggot that <strong>feasts</strong> on our dead... That would be you!"</p>
<p>"Madness! You seek death then, Zeon?"</p>
<p>"We want to live. <strong>That is why</strong> we fight." And the other Kevesi soldiers walked forward and surrounded the Consul. He watched them drew their blades pointing at him. Noah and Mio rejoined the group. "<strong>Prepare yourself, CONSUL B!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Why you... You good-for-nothing imbecile!" And he transformed into his Moebius form. "All defectors must be eradicated!"</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Zeon!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Yes.</em> <strong>Let's go!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Moebius B fell to the group, transformed back to Consul form sitting down, head drooped. "It's futile, you know. You won't change anything... You think you have a future...? Well you don't. <em>Only suffering and despair.</em>" And he transformed totally into blue motes. They sheathed their blades then.</p>
<p>Looking at the floating motes, he had his reply, but he wouldn't hear it anymore, "Even so... the choice is mine."</p>
<p>"Lay things out for me here, Commander." Kite and the others were approaching him, now that they had a chance to hear him out. "Our Consul's a monster.{{footnote: Well that rhymes!}} <strong>Our Flame Clock's busted. We still don't have enough food to go round.</strong> I have to ask... <strong>What was the point of all this?</strong>"</p>
<p>"We succeeded. Though not quite the way I'd hoped. <strong>Now then, listen.</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"Y-<strong>you can't be serious! Then what, it was all a sham?</strong>" Kite can't believed his ears. The rest of the Kevesi soldiers didn't interrupt.</p>
<p>"So it would appear. For that reason, we need to learn as much as we can. About ourselves. And about the world outside."</p>
<p>"<strong>OH, IS THAT EVERYTHING? AND WHILE EATING SHOE LEATHER?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"If need be. Whatever the outcome may be, only <em>we</em> can change it. <em>I believe that</em>." Kite doesn't know how to rebut. The rest didn't have anything to say so far.</p>
<p>Noah offered, "We'll help you out too, not because we're looking for your acceptance, but just so everyone can live. So please, let us further your goal."</p>
<p>Zeon: "I know you still have doubts, but won't you give them a chance?" The rest of the soldiers looked at each other, trying to find social acceptance. Only Kite looked unwaveringly at the commander.</p>
<p>Roald started first, "I'll confess, I'm still a bit dazed by these developments... But... I could let them off." With a smile on his face.</p>
<p>"Yeah, same." Eilis agreed. "The commander's never quite been this insistent. If Mwamba were here, I think he'd been agreed much sooner..." And the rest, including Fox, agreed with him therefore.</p>
<p>Zeon: "Friends..."</p>
<p>"Well, I'm still not buying it. The one to make the call, should be me. I should decide! Nobody else... I'll <em>prove</em> it. <strong>The only one fit to be commander... is me.</strong>" That's Kite. As he finished, he walked through the others and walked away himself, with the others turning around and looking at his attitude, "We're gone." The others followed him thereafter.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Man, way to go off on one..."</p>
<p>"Kite, he just worries for the colony. He will come round eventually."</p>
<p>Lanz: "So? What's the word now, boss?"</p>
<p>"First, I want to solve the food shortage."</p>
<p>Eunie: "What, you mean... by taking long hikes? It'll be tough without anything nearby."</p>
<p>"<em>That was the case up until now.</em> <strong>Myself, I'll try it the other way</strong>."</p>
<p>Lanz: "What way?"</p>
<p>"<em>We'll make fields.</em> Our own food supply, grown with our own hands."</p>
<p>Eunie: "When he says fields, does he mean like that bit in the textbook?"</p>
<p>Taion memorized the definitions from the textbook, "'When food is scarce, one may till the soil, and plant Glitter Radishes.'"</p>
<p>"<em>You always know your stuff.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Obviously.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "I see. It was difficult to find time before, since you had to worry about the Flame Clock."</p>
<p>"Yes, but not any longer."</p>
<p>Mio: "Heh. You're giving it a go then?"</p>
<p>"There will <em>be toil, but we'll try.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion shared, "Then... start by observing the vegetation. It's not just soldiers that want to survive out here. You're sure to learn something." He looked out at the grass and shrubs out in the plains while he speak.</p>
<p>"I understand. We'll try that." Then, turning to Noah, "Oh and... if you're ever in need of my support, just call on me. I'll help."</p>
<p>"That's appreciated, but... are you really sure?"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>If you truly want to change something, you must start with the self.</em></strong> <em>I believe you said that.</em>"</p>
<p>Before he could say anything, Eunie cut in, "Still, <em>some folks aren't gonna like you, when you're palling around with us lot.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It doesn't matter what they think of me</em>. What truly matters, is whether I carry out my duty."</p>
<p>Noah noted, "Zeon... You haven't changed at all."</p>
<p>"Sarcasm? At this stage?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "Not at all... I was just thinking that... you're still the same old friend from back then."</p>
<p>"You've gained a way with words. I see. Perhaps people <em>can</em> change."</p>
<p>"Wow, ouch!"</p>
<p>"Ahahahah! <em>You gave us strength. Thank you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Thank <em>you</em>."</p>

<p>While traversing the icy mountains, 3 tiny levnises canceled their invisibility status and appeared in front of the group. They once seen one of these in Maktha Wildwood. They were immediately alerted, with Noah distressingly exclaimed, "What's this now?!"</p>
<p>The levnises immediately summoned their double-handed axes. Lanz: "Seriously? More of those mudders, come to ruin our day again?!"</p>
<p>Sena summoned her hammer, suggested, "Let's ruin theirs first!" Seeing no other choices than encounters, the others prepared for the fight.</p>
<hr />
<p>During the fight, one slash or a knock sent the levnises back, sparking electricity. Mio launched herself towards them; the groups had created some distance in between. "<strong>Haaaaaaaa!!</strong>" She aimed for the central one, but the one to her right came out and blocked her, 1v1.</p>
<p>"<strong>Mimi!</strong>" The levnis put her axe up to the left, signaling the other two to retreat. Then, it faced the group itself, walking slowly towards the group.</p>
<p>Noah: "<strong>Incoming!</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "A tactical retreat?" Then, he attacked it, helped by Eunie; but the levnis easily blocked their attacks by axe slashes. Then, it dashed towards the group.</p>
<p>"<strong>Lanz!</strong>" Noah and Lanz therefore started dashing towards the levnis.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got it!" Both of them blocked two of the axes. Then, he called out, "Sena! Hit 'em where it hurts, will ya?"</p>
<p>"<strong>AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!</strong>" And it shattered the chest of the Levnis, revealing a female inside. Sena was shocked at what she'd revealed, sheathed her weapons and went after the damaged Levnis. The Flame Clock was still attached to the Levnis, glowing pink; it was one-sixth filled. "Huh! What the...? What's going on here...?" The female had short (neck-long) gray hair, one side covering one of her eyes. She wore a collar glowing pink, and a dark vest. Her smash had been strong; she was unconscious, stunned.</p>
<hr />
<p>They got the female out of the cask and laid her on the floor, while Riku went to check the Levnis, and Manana taking care of her. The group gathered around to discuss. Noah started the conversation, "Who is this girl...? Where did she come from? For a soldier, she's awfully, uhm..."</p>
<p>Eunie folded her arms, "Yeah, I know what you mean. She looks about three terms old. Way too young to be fighting on the front lines."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Not to derail the convo, but are we sure she'll be OK? We pulled her outta the Lev, but is there anything else we can do?"</p>
<p>Taion stated his observations, "I don't see any external injuries, but no signs of waking up either. Hard to tell either way."</p>
<p>"Uhm..." Sena felt that it was her fault to crush such an innocent-looking third termer.</p>
<p>Mio heard her grunt and comforted her, "Sena, don't worry. She's still alive. I'm sure she'll pull through."</p>
<p>"<em>Mimi... You sure...?</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Look, we can talk about her all day, or we can find her a doctor. I know which one I'd prefer."</p>
<p>Taion: "All right, but she and her people did assault Colony soldiers, so taking her to a Colony seems like asking for trouble."</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Then how about the City? They have medical facilities there."</p>
<p>"Indeed. Seems advisable."</p>
<p>Lanz hadn't forgotten, "What do we do about the Levnis?"</p>
<p>Noah shook his head, "Let's leave it for now. Transporting the girl should take priority."</p>
<p>Sena volunteered, "Uhm, I can carry her!"</p>
<p>Mio: "Thanks, Sena. She'll be in good hands."</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll make sure of it."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the City, a doctor's aide told the group, "Ah, you're here. About the girl we transferred here... She's just woken up."</p>
<p>Sena was impressed, "Whoa! Really?"</p>
<p>"Yeah. Although, I should say, she's a little, uhm..." What's the correct word to describe her situation?</p>
<p>Taion prompted, "Were there any complications?"</p>
<p>"<strong>No, nothing like that.</strong> Or at least, nothing to complain to you about."</p>
<p>Eunie: "You're not making sense, and it's getting me antsy."</p>
<p>"The doctor said she didn't need any medical attention, and... You know what, why don't you just talk to her yourselves? Just bear in mind, she's still a patient, so take it easy on her, eh?" And he walked away, leaving them dumbfounded.</p>
<p>Taion concluded, "Seems at least they kept her safe... But now what?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Yeah, it ain't like we can just leave her here forever...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Let's talk to her first, like he said. We should try to learn more."</p>
<p>Lanz: "All right, but she's recently injured. We probably shouldn't all, <em>crowd</em> her."</p>
<p>Mio: "You're right. If we're just asking questions, one person should be enough."</p>
<p>"Hmph. That sounds like a plan. So who'll go?" Taion questioned.</p>
<p>Lanz assumed "Surely it's Eunie, right? She deals with injured people all the time, she should be right at home."</p>
<p>Eunie teased him back, "Oh yeah? Cheers for volunteering me."</p>
<p>Sena unwaveringly interrupted, "I'll go."</p>
<p>"You, Sena? Why the sudden impulse?" Mio felt weird.</p>
<p>"Well, it's probably my fault she's like this..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "It was really more like an accident, y'know. There's no need for you to feel responsible."</p>
<p>"It's not that exactly, i-it's more like... If I don't do something, erm, I..." She tilted her head to think, "I'll have a dirty, con... urgh con... <strong>con</strong>-science?"</p>
<p>Taion was impressed, "You've never heard that word out loud, have you?"</p>
<p>And she dropped her head as if about to cry, "Orggggg...."</p>
<p>Noah sees no problem with that, "Well then, we'll leave the girl to you. Is that all right, Sena?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'll be fine." Thanks for cheering!</p>
<p>Eunie: "Do be careful though. She might be meek now, but keep in mind she and her mates came after us."</p>
<p>"We'll be right outside. If anything happens, just shout."</p>
<p>"I can handle myself, Mimi. <em>But thanks, I will.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>"OK then, I'm going in." Once inside, "Ah...!" The girl already seated herself on the bed, looking innocent. She had crimson iris{{footnote: Now that we can see since she opened her eyes.}}, and a long single braided pony tail that reached her waist. The room was like a hostel room rather than a hospital room, so there was only bed and some furniture.</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>Trying to break the ice, "Urrr, ummm... <strong>Hi!</strong> I-I see you've woken up!"</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"How are you feeling? Any pain?"</p>
<p>"Can confirm faint sensation of pain in cranial region. However, operational efficiency of No. 7 remains unaffected."</p>
<p>"<strong>Whuh?!</strong>" And she scratched her head, trying to comprehend what had just been said. "Ah, O-OK... That's... <em>good...?</em>{{footnote: Good my arse.}} Actually, I'd, uhm... I'd like to apologize heh..."</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"Before, I didn't realize you were inside that thing, and..."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Erm, are you OK?"</p>
<p>"No major issues detected."</p>
<p>"I-I see... Uh... Anyway, if it's all right with you, could you tell me something about yourself?"</p>
<p>"The question lacks specificity. No. 7, cannot respond."</p>
<p>And she was back scratching her head, "Oh, I'm really sorry! I-I guess that was <em>a bit wishy-washy, huh</em>... Well, for starters, then... Are you a Kevesi soldier? Or, are you Agnian?"</p>
<p>"Keves... Agnus..."</p>
<p>"Yeah, that's right. You must know those, right?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative. However, discrepancy was encountered while processing query."</p>
<p>"<em>Huh? What do you mean?</em>"</p>
<p>"Affiliation of No. 7, does not match either of two options provided."</p>
<p>"Doesn't match...? Well then that only leaves..."</p>
<p>And she answered her before she make any guesses, "Special mobile combat unit under direct Moebius command, alias... Colony, 0."</p>
<p>"Whoa! You know about Moebius?"</p>
<p>"Affirmative."</p>
<p>"Then, when you attacked us..."</p>
<p>"Colony 0 soldiers of numbers 7 and below were tasked with eradication of Ouroboros."</p>
<p>She huffed and puffed, "Whhh-whoa, that's... <em>not great.</em>" And thinking in her head, "<em>So this girl really <strong>is</strong> our enemy... I have to warn the others...!</em>" And she took another look at her innocency and second-questioned her thoughts, "<em>Although... Is that really true? She did attack us... So, why is she like this now?</em>" And she closed her eyes to think for a while what to do with her before making her decision. Sena asked more to clarify her feelings, "Uhm, what you just told me... It sounded really important. Won't you get in trouble for saying it?"</p>
<p>"I was not ordered to silence on the matter."</p>
<p>"I, <em>I see, OK...</em> Oh, shoot, I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Sena. What's yours?"</p>
<p>"I have no name."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 7, does not possess information, under the category, 'name'."</p>
<p>"You don't have a name? Wait, so this, 'number seven' thing you've been saying all along...?"</p>
<p>"An individual identification number assigned to soldiers of Colony 0. We do not belong, to Keves, or Agnus. We are special assets. Publicly, we do not exist. Consequently, records of personal information stored in growth modules, are also expunged, at the time of birth."</p>
<p>"<em>That's... crazy...</em>"</p>
<p>"Shall I consider the questioning to be over?"</p>
<p>"No wait! What you just said... <em>You don't think it's strange?</em>"</p>
<p>"Cannot, ascertain, purpose of question. Requesting additional, clarification."</p>
<p>"I-I mean, for example... That name thing! A Colony that calls people by a number, that's so dehumanizing... Don't you feel bad to be called like that? I mean you're the same as us after all..."</p>
<p>"Cannot ascertain, purpose of question."</p>
<p>And she started feeling pity for her, "<em>Hrrrhhh... Ohh...</em>" She can't even fathom what it meant by dehumanizing.</p>
<p>She urged, "Requesting clarification." And Sena just can't stop sobbing. She didn't answer her, turned around and ran out of the room.</p>
<hr />
<p>"Sena?... <strong>Hey</strong>, you OK?" Lanz was concerned, seeing her face.</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Did you learn anything?... <em>Hang on, love, you don't look so good.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "What happened, Sena?"</p>
<p>With a sobbing tone, "<em>Mimi, I... I...! I don't know what to do...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah reassured, "Hey, Sena, everything's fine. Let's go somewhere we can talk. Is that all right?"</p>
<p>"<em>Y-yeah, sure...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Seated at the square park outside where they were permitted to cook in a square (not circle), after the group listened to the intel she'd gathered, Noah exclaimed, "<em>'Colony 0'...? Wow,...</em> they did seem like more than regular soldiers, but that's wild..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>If they're palling around with Moebius, we can't really ignore them, I suppose.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "We still have very little information. I think a more thorough investigation is in order."</p>
<p>Lanz: "OK, but we're talking about a tiny third-termer here."</p>
<p>"Hurrr..." There was something pressing on her heart. A person that had no name! And she didn't even realize!</p>
<p>Mio noticed there was still something in her head, questioned, "Sena, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em> Wh-what do I think about what?"</p>
<p>"You're the one that spoke with her. What's your gut telling you?"</p>
<p>"I just... I-I just asked questions, and she just, answered them. But... Even though she attacked us, she doesn't seem hostile or violent... And when I spoke to her, she was literally, just answering questions, it didn't feel like a conversation at all... She looks like us, but is actually a <strong>whole</strong> different kind of <em>being... That's how I felt</em>.. a-and then I got scared of her, and..."</p>
<p>"Awh, I'm sorry, Sena..."</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "<em>Sena, give us your honest opinion. Do you think she's an enemy?</em>"</p>
<p>"I don't really know yet. That's kind of why I..." And she strengthen her mind, "I'd like to try talking to her again, <em>I think.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz can't understand, "Whaddya mean? You just said you were <strong>scared</strong> of her."</p>
<p>"<strong>I am</strong>, it's true, but... <em>I want to make sure</em> I got the right idea, and that's, stronger than my fear. Not just about if she's an enemy, but, also about, who she <em>actually</em> is, how she thinks and feels..."</p>
<p>"Ahh I get it. You need a bit more time for that, sure."</p>
<p>"Right. I also want to say sorry for leaving without saying anything, <em>last time...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie suggested, "OK then, if you're doing a house visit and apologizing at once, how about a little gift, <em>to grease the wheels?</em>"</p>
<p>That excites Mio somewhat, "<strong>Oh! Sena, you could bring her your onigiri!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Onigiri?" Noah clearly hadn't heard about that before (and perhaps not seen in her memories).</p>
<p>Taion explained, "It's a portable Agnian snack, made of packed, boiled mythrice."</p>
<p>Mio added enthusiastically, "They're lovely and salty, especially the way Sena makes them! They <strong>really</strong> hit the spot after a <strong>long</strong> training session."</p>
<p>Lanz was probably the most surprised, "<strong>Huh, you can make food...?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>O-of course I can!...</strong> Onigiri at least. <em>Oh, wait... Uhng... But we don't have any mythrice...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion suggested, "They should have decent reserves in Colony Lambda."</p>
<p>Eunie instantly snapped, "Hey, nice...!" Then, her brain recoiled on her, "No, hang on, <strong>how did you know that</strong> off the top of your head?"</p>
<p>"Commander Isurd likes them. The onigiri."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Well, that's just peachy then. Hope he doesn't mind sharing."</p>
<p>"<em>Thanks, you guys!</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the Michiba Kitchen, she scratched her head with the ingredients placed in front of her. "Man, I haven't made onigiri in a minute... <em>Hope I can still shape them right!</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>After she produced the finished products, she congratulated herself, "Ahh, that's nice! Now, let's take them to our patient."</p>
<hr />
<p>Before entering the room, Taion interrupted, "<em>Sena, wait. This time around, we'd like to sit in on the conversation too.</em>"</p>
<p>"Huh? But I thought..."</p>
<p>Lanz reassured, "No worries, we'll hang back and watch. We're happy to let you do the talking."</p>
<p>"Um, <em>OK then, if you say so...</em>"</p>
<p>No. 7, still sitting on the bed from earlier, raised her head and saw she was back, this time with the others. She stood forward and started speaking, "Hey, sorry to intrude... Can we have a moment?"</p>
<p>"No objections. You wish to resume questioning."</p>
<p>She shook her head, "N-no, that's- not why I'm here. <em>It's just that last time, I was kinda rude...</em> So, to apologize, I thought I'd visit again and, <strong>bring you</strong> a little something."</p>
<hr />
<p>On the table laid down her masterpiece. No. 7 had moved herself to sit in front of the onigiri. "<strong>Hmmm!!!</strong>" Awfully pleasant to the eyes, excellently arousing for the nose, and what's more...</p>
<p>"I-I figured you might be hungry. They're called onigiri..."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, she explained herself, "I'm not very good at this, so they're about the only thing I can make..."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<strong>But I can guarantee they're tasty, and actually,</strong> Mimi says so too... Ah, Mimi, I mean Mio, she's..."</p>
<p>"Yes." And they heard her stomach rumbled so loud it echoed the room. Her eyes fixed on the onigiri while she was listening to them talking and 'patiently' answering 'yes' to each of her statements, perhaps left ear in, right ear out.</p>
<p>Hearing so, Sena: "Oh, sorry, my bad! Please, uh feel free to eat."</p>
<p>"I will eat." And she picked up one onigiri and took a bite.</p>
<p>"<strong>How about it then?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Cannot affertain... uhm purpofe of... queftion..." That was talking while biting.</p>
<p>"Are they tasty? Did I make them right?"</p>
<p>"With regard to... firft queftion... No. 7, confiderf... 'tafty', to be, accurate... affeffment."</p>
<p>"Oh, r-r-really? That's good to hear!"</p>
<p>"In regard to... second, application, of, manual preffure... refulted in, compaction and, higher cohesion. Alfo showing, excess salt level..."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh...</em> <strong>No, wait, that's the best part! Isn't it nice and chewy?</strong>"</p>
<p>After swallowing what's in her mouth, she agreed, "Affirmative."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Then why are you saying the science is bad when you agree it's nice and chewy?</p>
<p>Turning her head to Sena, she added, "No. 7, has not taken sustenance, in this form before. Currently considering that others of Colony 0, may also enjoy, the experience."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh</em>, you think so?"</p>
<p>"Particularly No. 9, seemed to be growing, <strong>disaffected</strong> with the rations being distributed...{{footnote: She turned her head back on to focusing on the onigiri.}} And No. 3, whose calorie intake exceeds the baseline, may find, these more sating... As a precaution, salt levels may have to be marginally adjusted, pursuant to guidance from No. 6..."</p>
<p>"Hah..." That was informative, huh!</p>
<p>And she turned back towards Sena, "Hm... Is there a problem?"</p>
<p>"No, no, i-it's nothing. Oh, <em>but</em>... if it's OK with you, could I ask you to tell me more?"</p>
<p>"Acknowledged. Continuing explanation." And they continued talking while she finished the remaining onigiri.</p>
<hr />
<p>After finishing the plate, she got herself back sitting on the bed, with Sena standing beside, nearer to her. She hoped for another praise, perhaps, or just affirmative comments to soothe her confidence, "So, were the onigiri tasty?"</p>
<p>"You already have a sufficient reply to this question."{{footnote: LOL.}}</p>
<p>"Have you, come- to- <strong>like</strong> the onigiri I made?" OK, that <em>was</em> the real question.</p>
<p>"Affirmative."</p>
<p>With great smiles on her face, "Well, that's good then. I'll make them for you again sometime."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>In the background, Lanz stated his observation softly, "<em>Well, she eats like normal, and she can handle small talk.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie added, "Yeah, there's nothing suspicious about her. <em>Except she talks funny, but whatever.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio suggested, "Let's let Sena keep her talking for a bit longer."</p>
<p>Back at the spotlight, Sena changed the topic, "Hey, you said you didn't have a name."</p>
<p>"Recollection of making such a statement exists."</p>
<p>And she suggested with great encouragement, "Well, then... What about, 'Segiri'?"</p>
<p>And there was a long pause as she was trying to understand what she meant, "Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"Uh..." She started scratching her head as the atmosphere got somewhat nervous, anxious.</p>
<p>"Perhaps this is some sort of code, or cipher."</p>
<p>"<strong>No</strong>, I'm just... I was asking what you thought about, 'Segiri', for a name."</p>
<p>"Cannot follow logic behind query. Requesting more rational explanation."</p>
<p>"You're using difficult words again... I-I just, didn't want to keep <strong>only</strong> calling you 'you'."</p>
<p>"The designation 'No. 7', is..."</p>
<p>And she cut her off, "Right! I just took the 'se-' part from 'seven', a-and tacked on the 'giri' from 'onigiri'. 'Se-giri'!"</p>
<p>"Failure to comprehend basis for utilizing this nomenclature."</p>
<p>"Well, i-it's 'cause... You said you <strong>liked</strong> onigiri, just then... <em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz in the background interrupted for the first time, "<strong>Whoa</strong> whoa whoa whoa whoa, Sena... <em>Don't you think you're taking it a bit far?</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Yeah, love</em>... Did you lose your brain at the gym or something?"</p>
<p>Even Taion cannot fathom, "I'm sorry, Sena. I don't think I see what you're after here."</p>
<p>"Whoa, when did everyone get so mean? I think it's a great name, 'Segiri'..."</p>
<p>Noah scratched his head in agreement, against the others' opinions, "Y-yeah, I think so too, actually. It seems really, uh, friendly, somehow..."</p>
<p>Mio was supporting her as usual, "Ahaha! It's not really like <strong>you</strong> to come out with something like this, Sena."</p>
<p>"<em>R-really...?</em> Well, maybe so... But Mimi, I don't think it's right to <strong>call</strong> a person by a number..."</p>
<p>No. 7: "Hmm..."</p>
<p>"<em>Hey, I'm sorry. I let my mouth run away from me. I understand if you felt hurt by it.</em>"</p>
<p>"Regulations contain no special provisions, on restricting, designation."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 7 has no authority based on which to reject proposed designations, whatever they may be."</p>
<p>She tried to interpret her vocabulary, "<em>Does that mean we can call you 'Segiri', and you won't mind?</em>"</p>
<p>After thinking for a few second, she replied, "...Affirmative."</p>
<p>Eunie was impressed, teasingly commented, "Well, there you have it then, <em>affirmative.</em>" The last she tried to sound like Segiri robot-like voice with single-tone.</p>
<p>Mio congratulated her, "Mhmmm... Nicely done, Sena."</p>
<p>"Yeah, thanks uhuh!" Thinking in her head, "<em>The girl might still be a total mystery, but really, it wouldn't have been right to call her 'number seven'...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Now that she was more used to the talking, the group gathered closer by Segiri's side, making a semicircle around the bed. Just then, beep beep sounded in Segiri's iris, and that alerted her, "<strong>Hmph!</strong>"</p>
<p>"What happened?"</p>
<p>"A coded transmission from Colony 0." She checked the popup and explained. Turning to the group, "The Moebius Consul F, is requesting parley, with the Ouroboros."</p>
<p>Noah cannot believed his ears, "<strong>The Moebius is requesting what...?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"No. 7, will use, <strong>own Iris</strong>, as relay to forward the transmission to you." And the group answered the call, joining in from their irises.</p>
<p>Moebius F, with a thick snail-shell head, standing in a dark place with no background, spotlight on him, started the conversation, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, my young Ouroboros friends. I am F, and before we go further, I would like to sincerely apologize for the discourtesy of this method of introduction."</p>
<p>Eunie was disgusted, "Ugh, what a shameless slug. He thinks we'll forget he tried to kill us?"</p>
<p>Taion replied, "You say you want to parley. How do you imagine <em>that will go, at this point...?</em>"</p>
<p>"I am certain you will feel guarded, and rightly so. And yet, with that acknowledged, I would like to offer an opening of <em>negotiations with you.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "Negotiations?"</p>
<p>"Should you accept my invitation, I will rescind the extermination order on you Ouroboros. Colony 0 will henceforth no longer concern itself with <strong>your</strong> comings and goings."</p>
<p>Lanz sniped back 'positively', "<strong>Oh, that'd be swell!</strong>... If we were stupid enough to trust your word."</p>
<p>Noah: "And your demands?"</p>
<p>After a short pause, "...<em>The bodily return of No. 7.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Noah: "And that's it? That's all it would take for you to never fight with us again?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you have my guarantee, and that of the whole of Colony 0."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>Are you joking? You're Moebius. You'd <strong>throw</strong> away one or two soldiers without <strong>batting</strong> an eye.</em>"</p>
<p>"Certainly, some Consuls do display such callousness, a <strong>deplorable</strong> state of affairs... But not I. I hold the light of life possessed by Colony 0 to be of the <strong>utmost</strong> importance. <em>Naturally, that includes No. 7.</em> That is precisely why I have reached out to you, nominally my enemies, even <strong>with</strong> the concomitant difficulties acknowledged."</p>
<p>Sena sternly asked, "Are you telling the truth?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "C'mon Sena, don't fall for it..."</p>
<p>Sena continued, "Can you give us a guarantee that you aren't lying to us right now?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Of course!</strong>... is what I would love to say but, <strong>naturally</strong>, simple words are never enough to engender trust, I know." Then, he sent some data to Segiri, then continued, "I have sent the current coordinates of Colony 0 to No. 7. We shall remain here. <em>Should you find yourselves receptive to my offer</em>, do <strong>please</strong> pay us a visit, <em>and bring No. 7 with you.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah questioned, "<strong>So you think giving us your location will make us trust you?</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion added, "How do we know this isn't a trap?"</p>
<p>"<em>In such a circumstance, you would possess a handy hostage in No. 7. I trust I needn't say more?</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Ugh... <strong>Had this guy heard</strong> the way he sounds?"</p>
<p>F shook his head, "Of course, that is not what any of us really want. My desire is to see No. 7 <em>safely returned to me. That is all.</em>" Then he called out, "No. 7."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I am tasking you with guiding them to Colony 0. Follow their command until your return."</p>
<p>"Compliance."</p>
<p>"And... No. 7?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"<em>We've all been worried about you.</em>"</p>
<p>"Hmmm..."</p>
<p>"<em>That will be all. I will eagerly anticipate the day when we meet in more favorable circumstances.</em>" And he ended the call.</p>
<p>And Segiri stood up thereafter, restating, "By the Consul's authority, No. 7 is hereby assigned to the Ouroboros' command, as an exceptional measure for the duration. Pending your decision on the outcome of the proposed exchange, I await your command to depart."</p>
<p>Noah scratched his head, "<em>Well this was... unexpected.</em>"</p>
<p>Sena voiced her thoughts loudly, "Segiri... <em>What do we do with you...?</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Still gathering around Segiri in the room, Lanz questioned, "Wait, are you serious? You <strong>really</strong> trust that Consul?"</p>
<p>Sena: "Of course I don't, not entirely. I know it could be a trap, as well, but still... If... And, this is a big 'if', OK? If he was telling the truth earlier, then we won't have to fight with Segiri and her friends... And more importantly, I'm sure there are people waiting for her there... So, for all those reasons, <em>I thought...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah crossed his arms, "Well, either way, things can't stay like this forever."</p>
<p>Taion concluded her thoughts, "Rather than make speculation after speculation and do nothing, you want to set something in motion."</p>
<p>Mio considered, "It's also possible, if unlikely, <em>that we <strong>might</strong> be able to talk it through...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah, turning to Segiri, "All right. Can you tell us where Colony 0 is right now?"</p>
<p>"Aetia region, Captocorn Peak."</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh? Wait, isn't that...?"</p>
<p>Eunie finished her sentence, "That's where we fought against those guys, ain't it?"</p>
<p>"The point where Colony 0 is stationed, is located even further in."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>That explains why you were lying in wait for us there.</em>"</p>
<p>And then she warned, "However, the geographical feature, called the 'Nocclia Mire', is located, en route. Entering it, is predicted to have severe negative impact, on your biological processes."</p>
<p>"Then how do you guys get through?" Mio asked.</p>
<p>"A Ferron's environmental hazard resistance, can temporarily neutralize poisonous materials."</p>
<p>Sena questioned, "What's a 'Ferron'...? <em>Oh, is that the thing you were riding inside?</em>"</p>
<p>"Affirmative. Consequently, traversal through the afflicted area, will necessitate, retrieval and refurbishing, of the abandoned Ferron suit."</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "We can ask Riku to fix it up. Will that be OK with you?"</p>
<p>"No objections."</p>
<p>Scratching his head, "Ohhh, if Riku must. Will not leave friends in lurch."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>All right then. Just be patient for us a little while longer, OK, Segiri?</em>"</p>
<p>"Compliance."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found the abandoned Ferron, with Segiri tagging along. After some examination from Riku, Noah asked, "How does it look, Riku? Can you get it in working order?"</p>
<p>"It look like problem mostly cosmetic. Riku have it working in no time flat."</p>
<hr />
<p>After some fixing, "Annnnddd ready. Riku proud of own handiwork."</p>
<p>Sena: "And how does it look to you? Can you still use it?"</p>
<p>Segiri reported the statistics from inside the Ferron, now that she climbed into it, "Power lines clear. All sensors online... Ferron unit No. 7, fully operational."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>That... sounds good? A-are you ready to guide us?</em>" Nope, don't understand all the checks and technical stuff, but let's continue.</p>
<p>"Understood. Designating route."</p>
<hr />
<p>They found Consul F at the location he sent them. There were other levnises and Ferrons parked around the edge of the open-ended cavern. Open-ended means the cavern opened itself to the sky, with a cliff at the edge, and they could look out to other mountains from the inside, or just, jump off the cliff, if they'd like to. F: "Welcome, friends. I have been hoping you would come."</p>
<p>Noah: "We've brought your soldier as you asked. So what now?"</p>
<p>He turned to Segiri, whom climbed out of her Ferron and stood beside Sena, examined her from afar, "Hmm... No. 7 seems uninjured. Thank you for this magnanimous measure. As promised, Colony 0's order to eradicate Ouroboros, will be rescinded. <strong>You have my word</strong>, that we will never again <em>darken your doorsteps, figuratively speaking</em>."</p>
<p>Eunie didn't believed a word, "Hah. Talk is cheap, man."</p>
<p>"Oh I assure you, the soldiers of Colony 0 are <strong>most</strong> faithful. They would <strong>never</strong> disobey, an issued order. What's more, I personally have nothing but the deepest respect for you all. After all, you did tend to my dear No. 7, and brought her back to me <strong>unscathed</strong>... I offer you my sincere, <em>heartfelt thanks.</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<em>Yeeeahh, all right...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie, arms folded, shook her head, "<em>This, doesn't sit right with me.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh I have just had the greatest idea. No. 7, you and our guests have traveled long and far to arrive here. Why don't we introduce them to the rest of the Colony 0 personnel?"</p>
<p>"Complaince."</p>
<p>Noah was feeling not, shaking his head, "Uh, <strong>I think we're actually fine...</strong>"</p>
<p>The Consul shook his head, "Nonsense, no need to be shy. We need to tie a bond of trust between us, and where better to start than with a round of introductions?" Makes sense.</p>
<p>Sena asked, "Segiri, are you all right with that?"</p>
<p>"The Consul's word is absolute. No. 7, does not have the prerogative of choice."</p>
<p>"No. 7, show your face to everyone. I'm sure they'd like that... No. 4 has also been worried about you."</p>
<p>"...Yes."</p>
<p>Sena: "No. 4?"</p>
<p>The Consul explained, "No. 4 is No. 7's right-hand man. <em>With No. 7 absent,</em> he had to take over the <em>reins instead.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie got it, "He means like being an aide, then?"</p>
<p>Sena caught the important terms, "Segiri, does that make you the commander?"</p>
<p>"Parts of the definition appear discrepant, but on the whole, there are no major issues with that denomination."</p>
<p>Surprised, she let out, "You could've told us, you know..."</p>
<p>"I have no record, of the fact being queried."</p>
<p>Noah's eyes peered over his shoulder to the right, where Taion stood, silently commented, "<em>You've noticed it too, right, Taion?</em>"</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I can't make sense of it. The Consul's attitude is one thing, <em>but more importantly...</em>"</p>
<p>Skimming the cave, Noah continued, "<em>The Ferronis. The one thing a colony needs, and there's no sign of it here. Or maybe... Maybe it's just, something completely different from the colonies we know?</em>"</p>
<p>Taion shook his head, unable to ascertain, "A special unit under direct Moebius command... Were we too hasty, coming here?"</p>
<p>Sena turned to Sena and Segiri, whom were still chatting, "<em>For Sena's sake, and for that girl she trusts, let's hope not.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>In the Colony, Segiri met with No. 4, a young boy wearing the swimsuit-like costume too, pointed chin, large eyes, and boy-like hair (???), conversing with her, "No. 7... I'm relieved to see you back safe." We noticed there was also the collar on his neck, but because she don't have the long-hair like Segiri's, we can see it was a backbone-like structure attached to his backbone.</p>
<p>She immediately get back to her work status, "No. 4. No status abnormalities?"</p>
<p>"We're all good here. No. 10 and No. 8 are currently on a mission, but should be back soon."</p>
<p>Segiri thought for a while, seeing that he had misunderstood her. "Revising query. Are there status abnormalities in No. 4's condition?"</p>
<p>"A-a-ah, no, I'm OK. No. 4 can still fight." He really thought deep about it as he felt himself.</p>
<p>"However..."</p>
<p>"No. 7, you're not at fault. If anything, i-i-it's my fault, having such poor abilities in battle. Without disengaging the Ferron's limiter, I-I couldn't fight properl- Urgggh..." And he just started falling and grumbling in pain.</p>
<hr />
<p>After he lose consciousness, Segiri immediately stepped forward and held him by his shoulder, prevented him from falling, "Huuuuhhh, No. 4!"</p>
<p>Lanz was concerned, "Wh-what's wrong? What is it?" And red motes started floating off his body.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Sparks, you don't think this is..."</p>
<p>Mio: "His flame's leaking...!"</p>
<p>No. 4 still had his conscious, knell on the floor as Segiri followed him down, "Hrrrrrr... I'm cold... No. 7... Where are... I can't see... a thing... Hoh" After a while, his flames stopped leaking. Segiri put him down on the floor. While he hadn't turned into a dry husk, his eyes were bland and lifeless, unconscious. His face turned dark, lifeless.</p>
<p>"Huuuuorrrrrr..."{{footnote: No. 4 actually lost his life; he never revive later in the story.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Sena, in a hushed tone, "<strong>Segiri! What just happened?!</strong>"</p>
<p>F was the one explaining, "No. 4 has given his life to the Ferron."</p>
<p>They turned to him, with Lanz asking: "<em>Oi, you'd better explain yourself.</em>"</p>
<p>He turned to look at the Ferron, explained, "The Ferrons are powered by life's flames. The Flame Clocks that impel them are synchronized to <em>those of their passengers.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion was thinking when he heard the key term, "Wait, did you say Flame Clocks? Does that make the Ferrons...?"</p>
<p>He knew what he's asking about, nodded, "Indeed. The design differs, but you could see them as functionally identical to Ferronises. In addition, Ferron Flame Clocks are fitted with the function to disengage the limiters."</p>
<p>Noah squinted, "'Disengage the limiters'...?"</p>
<p>"Doing so allows the Ferron to burn through the flames that fuel it at an accelerated rate, maximizing the unit's power output. Once the limiter is disengaged, a first-term soldier can perform at a level comparable to a colony's commander... That incandescent power is the <strong>pith</strong>, and marrow of the <strong>Ferron's, of Colony 0's might.</strong>" And his tone got excited.</p>
<p>Taion prompted for more explanations, "But what <em>is</em> Colony 0, to begin with? Who are you, who are its soldiers?"</p>
<p>"You could say we are those who work behind the scenes of this war. Battlefield manipulation, inciting sedition, information control, elimination of third party forces... It's all due to our <strong>ceaseless, thankless efforts</strong>, that this war can continue unabated, and each life's fate arrives, as ordained... In other words, we <strong>maintain</strong> the <strong>fabric</strong> of the world. <strong>That, is the duty which is our pleasure to fulfill.</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion wasn't convinced. "Nothing but empty words. <strong>That's the</strong> reason you put your men in those things?!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Well mate, <strong>you</strong> just showed us your whole arse. I knew <em>you didn't care about the lives of your soldiers after all!</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Preposterous! I treasure their lives above any other good! They are, to me, the most exalted substance!</strong> Their immaculate lives, <strong>sacrificed in service to the world</strong>, permeate it, and form the basis of the eternity <strong>WE MOEBIUS COVET...!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena had been controlling to not explode, closing her eyes all along, "<em>Stop it.</em>"</p>
<p>He hadn't heard her, continued his explanation, "Protecting my innocent lambs whose souls <strong>lubricate the gears of the world, through a sublime sacrifice -- that, is the HIGHEST CALLING!!! Isn't it the loftiest vocation conceivable? Surely you must agree-</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>SHUT UP ALREADY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>He was flabbergasted, "Ah I must beg your pardon. Have I said something to incur your displeasure?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Snuff all of that, and snuff you! How dare you... How could someone like you think for a SECOND you treasure Segiri! You have no right! We'll bring you down, right here and now... Segiri and everyone will be FREE from the Flame Clocks!</strong>"</p>
<p>He didn't understood, can't fathomed, "But what in the blazes has brought this on? I told you from the start, I had no intention of fighting you..."</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>He closed his eyes for a moment thought, and looked up, made up his mind, "<em>Well, it seems unavoidable, now...</em> It seems the negotiations have broken down. Truly regrettable, and yet perhaps, inevitable..."</p>
<hr />
<p>"All Ferron units, heed my call! You are ordered to disengage your limiters."</p>
<p>"Huh!" So that's an order? And you said you care about my life? Just after No. 4 had over-disengaged his limiters and collapsed in front of me?</p>
<p>"No. 7. Your orders. <strong>Bring all your might to bear and crush the Ouroboros.</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena turned around and shouted to her, "<strong>SEGIRI! LISTEN! YOU DON'T-</strong>"</p>
<p>"Complaince." And she shakily stood up, her voice firm, then continued, "Commencing Ouroboros annihilation."</p>
<p>"<em>Segiri.</em>" And she walked towards her Ferron while Sena was feeling sad about it. She booted it up, other Ferrons lined at the edge of the cliff also activated theirs (except for No. 4's). Consul F teleported behind Segiri while the other Ferrons moved up to lined up with her. All except Sena drew their blades to prepare for the fight.</p>
<p>Taion was trying to get her into status, speaking from behind her, "I know how you must feel... But for now, we have to fight, Sena."</p>
<p>Segiri: "All units fall in and stand by."</p>
<p>Eunie was confused, "Wh-what's this?"</p>
<p>"Consul, a report."</p>
<p>"What's the matter, No. 7?"</p>
<p>"Large expenditure of life's flames is forecast, if limiters are disengaged for combat. Proposal following analysis of all units' flame totals: Restrict limiter disengagement, to unit No. 7."</p>
<p>"Hmm... I see."</p>
<p>Lanz was equally confused, "What...? <em>What's she doing? Trying to get her mates out of fighting?</em>"</p>
<p>Sena gasped; she might have realized something.</p>
<p>F had finished making decisions, "No. 7, I recognize your <strong>unparalleled</strong> radiance. It brings you honor. Now behold. By my authority as Consul, I order you: <strong>All Ferron units, disengage limiters!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Huh!" And all Ferron flames burst, changing from blue flames into purple flames.</p>
<p>"<strong>SEGIRI!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "That <em>snuffer</em>! Just when I thought he couldn't go <em>lower</em>!"{{footnote: Oh it rhymes!}}</p>
<p>"Oh, No. 7... <strong>Truly you are a marvel.</strong> The cry wafting from your spirit, <strong>it will water this endless world and make it bloom eternal!</strong>" And F teleported away to unknown places, leaving the place for them to fight.</p>
<p>Mio instructed, "First off, let's deal with <strong>these</strong> guys!"</p>
<p>Sena had recuperated from her sadness temporarily, "Yeah! Just wait, Segiri... <strong>We'll get you out of this mess, I promise!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>Segiri's Ferron dashed towards them with dual axes launching at them. Sena shouted, "<strong>LANZ!!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>YEAH!!</strong>" And they transformed into Ouroboros form, with Sena in control, blocking the axes with the handle of her hammer.</p>
<p>"Segiri, please! Just snap out of it! You don't. have. to follow these orders! <strong>Segiri,</strong> you're free to do what you want!" And she pushed her back.</p>
<p>As she stood up, "Segi-... Free... to...?" She was temporarily out of the Consul's expectations.</p>
<p>F teleported in, seeing the situation not well, "Well now... Hmm, what a curious phenomenon. No. 7, I'm changing your orders. <strong>Kill</strong> that Ouroboros first. Top priority."</p>
<p>"Uck-... Complia-..." Her head felt throbbing as she felt irresistible to orders.</p>
<p>"<strong>Don't do it, Segiri!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's an order</strong>, No. 7."</p>
<p>"<strong>Urrrrrggggghhhhhh! ARRRRRGGGGGHHHHHH!!!</strong>" And she threw an axe at Sena's Ouroboros. It didn't hit, but flew past her.</p>
<p>"No. 7? What are you <strong>ARGGGGGHHHH!!!</strong>" The axe had sliced through him from behind him.</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>ARRRGGGGHHH... Im... poss... N-n-No.</strong> <em>7</em>" Black fog had started leaking out of his damaged core. Sena, seeing the situation right, threw her hammer and knocked the Consul down; he couldn't even dodge. One hit KO, and he turned into blue motes. All Ferrons therefore disabled themselves.</p>
<p>After cancelling the Interlink, "<strong>SEGIRI!!!</strong>" She dashed towards her Ferron, shouted from outside, "<strong>ARE YOU OK?! Please, TALK TO ME, SEGIRI!!!</strong>" The rest of the group joined behind her, equally concerned.</p>
<p>Speaking from within her Ferron, "Urgghhh...Number... Four..."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"No. 4... Don't go... No. 7... will protect... No. 4... Everyone..."</p>
<p>Sena thought for a while, turned to "Noah, please... For Segiri... <strong>For them all...!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Right!" And he cut through the tiny Flame Clocks in front of their Ferron.{{footnote: God knows what power source they use after this.}}</p>
<hr />
<p>Segiri was standing in front of No. 4's Ferron, looking at it attentively. Sena was standing some short distance behind her, while the group waited even further behind. After a while, she walked up to her, to which Segiri spoke after sensing her, "With the Consul's death in the line of duty, Colony 0's chain of command, is broken. No. 7, currently has no duties to perform, and no orders to follow."</p>
<p>"<em>That means you don't have to fight us any more.</em>"</p>
<p>"However, it is a matter of record, that No. 7, took hostile action, against Ouroboros. Perhaps, you wish to mete out an appropriate punishment."</p>
<p>"<strong>Segiri, you did nothing wrong!</strong> Really, we should be thanking you."</p>
<p>"Thanking? Why would... that be?"</p>
<p>"I mean... Before, you attacked the Consul instead of us, so... You held back, from fighting us, and thanks to that, we were able to take down the Consul."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Anyway, that's enough about that. Now it's time to think to the future, right?"</p>
<p>She closed her eyes, "I. Cannot. Comprehend."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Why do you speak to No. 7 that way? Under what orders, and from whom? Why did No. 7 disobey orders? Why did <em>I</em> not attack you as instructed? Requesting swift reply. Furthermore, requesting orders."</p>
<p>"<em>Segiri...</em>"</p>
<p>"No. 7... is... <strong>confused</strong>!... <em>I</em> do not know what actions to take."</p>
<p>"I know what it's like to feel lost, uncertain, not know where to turn. But even <strong>you</strong>, must have some things you think you'd really like to do, right?"</p>
<p>"No. 7 does not have thoughts matching that description."</p>
<p>"In that case, let's put our heads together! Let's think of things you might wanna do."</p>
<p>"Is that an order?"</p>
<p>"Nuh-uh. Nobody's giving you orders any more. From now on, Segiri... The only orders you should follow, <em>are your own</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH!!!</strong>" And she searched through her mind for a while before continuing, "The situation described, does not conform to the accepted definition of, 'orders'."</p>
<p>"I... It was just like a, <strong>metaphor!</strong> Or... <em>Or was it a simile...?</em>"</p>
<p>"I. Really. Cannot. Comprehend."</p>
<p>"Uhh..."</p>
<p>Before she could think of how to explain, she explain it herself, "But, although I cannot comprehend... 'Segiri gives orders to No. 7.' If the circumstances be interpreted this way, then Segiri... I... may be able to comprehend."</p>
<p>"<em>Oh, Segiri...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Is it... odd?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>No, I don't think so. I'm sure it's- exactly- right. Since, after all, you're free now.</em> So, Segiri? What- are- your- orders- for- 'No. 7'?"</p>
<p>Putting her hands on her chin, "Top priority, should be to investigate what it is that I- 'want to do'. More data must be gathered before this is ascertained."</p>
<p>Scratching her head, "Ahaha... That sounds <em>very</em> like you, but I think you're making it too complicated. It doesn't have to be just- one- thing, and, it can be anything, really!"</p>
<p>"It can be... anything?"</p>
<p>"Yep, anything at all."</p>
<p>"In that case..."</p>
<p>"Yes? Did you think of something?" And her stomach started rumbling.</p>
<p>"Right now... I think I'd like... one of your onigiri... Sena." And she gladly.</p>
<hr />
<p>After quenching her hunger, Noah approached the two, "By the way, I-I wanted to ask about the Ferron... I suppose there's no way to use them any more?"</p>
<p>"That- statement- is incorrect."</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Oh</em>, really?"</p>
<p>"Motive function can be restored by switching to alternative power source, using ether cylinders.{{footnote: There you go! New power source!}} Power output will be inferior to the original Flame Clock system, and the limiter can't be removed, but shouldn't hinder combat. I will be able to fight on."</p>
<p>"Wow, t-that's great news. Do you think we can ask you to fight- by our side again, then?"</p>
<p>"Understood. Ferron unit No. 7, will gladly join, Ouroboros battle unit."</p>
<p>"We'll be counting on you then, Segiri!"</p>

<p><strong>Note from Translator:</strong> We won't be doing the 2nd part of the story.

<p>Entering a base on top of the snowy mountains, it used to be part of Y's experimental lab. At the other side of the room, in the middle, stood an empty pod. Noah wondered, "<em>What is this place...? And... is that a cradle?</em>"</p>
<p>They walked forward and observe it more. Cammuravi, whom scanned the surrounding, recalled, "<em>I... remember this room...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion prompt for more information, "Anything you want to tell us, Cammuravi?"</p>
<p>He turned to them and said, "<em>This is where I awoke, met Miyabi and the others.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio: "So that means that cradle is..."</p>
<p>He walked closer to it for inspection, and acknowledged, "It is no simple cradle. Fitted inside is a device which matures a life to a state close to Homecoming."</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>That makes sense...</em> So that's what Y used when reviving Mwamba and the others."</p>
<p>Ethel, whom were listening the whole time, suddenly asked, "<em>...Cammuravi, is that cradle still usable?</em>"</p>
<p>He answered without a second thought, "The installation works, just- <em>barely</em>. Why do you ask such a thing?"</p>
<p>Lanz wasn't having a good feeling, "Uhhhh... Ethel, <em>you're not thinking...?</em>"</p>
<p>"Our enemies are supernatural beings, monsters who use human lives for <strong>fodder.</strong> You can all fight against them, <strong>but me?</strong>" And she shook her head in hopelessness, "As I am now, I'm barely able to protect myself. All I can really do is hang back and watch, so as not to be a hindrance... <em>But... Suppose I was to use this cradle...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah tried to change her wrong thoughts{{footnote: Yes, we always have wrong thoughts all the time. Examples speak more clearly. E.g. we thought people, strangers, are unwilling to speak to us. That's wrong. They're as willing as you are. E.g. we thought people will look at us all the time, so we feel awkward when we wore the wrong shoes, or our hair tweaked to the wrong place. Wrong thought: other people don't always look down, and if they do, they're on their phone screens. You are probably none of their business; and because you feel awkward, you're probably the only one looking at other people and noticing their shoes (to calm your pitter patter heart).}}, "Ethel, you don't have <strong>anything</strong> to prove..."</p>
<p>Cammuravi spoke, "As far as the choices available to you go, you could also return to the City, and live a peaceful life. <em>And yet, you're saying you want to throw your body back under <strong>war's</strong> grindstone, and spend your life fighting?</em>" She didn't reply him, looked at him blandly, trying to read what he meant; but she does not need to. He continued, looked down and shook his head, "<em>...But then, you were ever thus. By the time you speak your mind, your body and soul are loooong ready. I think you should do as you wish.</em>"</p>
<p>Mio second guessed his opinion, "Cammuravi, are you sure it's fine? To embroil her in what's ultimately our fight?"</p>
<p>"Ethel's path should be hers to choose. I am certain her resolve is firm. If she wished for a life of peace, she would not have followed us this far... The <strong>Way</strong>... must have been inside her all along."</p>
<p>Taion can see the argument, can't deny logically but tries deny emotionally, "I sup-pose that's true, yes, but still..."</p>
<p>"I am anxious about the result, same as you. <em>Nevertheless</em>, as a devoted follower of none other but the Warrior's Way myself... <em>I wish to respect the will and resolve of one who has chosen the same path.</em> I believe Ethel's freedom is hers to do with as she wishes."</p>
<p>"Thank you, Cammuravi..."</p>
<p>"At- the same time, I am of course <strong>not</strong> in a position to <strong>decide</strong> such things myself. We have conveyed to you our desire. Would you tell us your opinion, in turn?"</p>
<p>"Huh..." And Ethel turned to the others with a perturbed mind. Will the others support her?</p>
<p>Mio asked the others, "Well, what should we do?"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And you can choose whether or not to put Ethel into the case here. In the case you choose not, interacting with the case again to 'change your mind'. To continue the story, of course we need to choose 'yes'.</p>

<p>Ethel stood in front of the cradle as it opened its door. She took off her unnecessary garments, left only with the gray shirt that all people born from the cradle came with{{footnote: YES, they born with shirt, as if shirt is one of their organs!}}. She turned around and looked at the others, and Cammuravi, being at the center of the stage, nodded back to her with encouragement. She nodded back and entered the pod. His eyes creaked; not as calm as he showed exteriorly. Her eyes still opened, looking over the translucent cradle door at the others for the last time as a child, closed it down.</p>
<p>After closing her eyes, she's ready, and the process of maturation{{footnote: 拔苗助长}} starts. The bright released from the maturation process was so bright the others have to closed their eyes, except Cammuravi, whom don't want to miss a single moment even if it blinds his eyes.{{footnote: Actually, his eyes was blind, at least the one that originally had the iris on, remember? Otherwise Ethel won't offered to be his eyes on the battlefield.}}</p>
<p>The cradle opened its door after the process finished, the light dimmed, and out stepped the grown-up Ethel, with her full armor{{footnote: What the spark! Don't ask me where her armors came from...}} on. Cammuravi casted a thin smile. She tested her wrist, fingers, and arms to see everything's working fine, all touch sensors intact.</p>
<hr />
<p>Outside the base, Ethel stood herself under light snow, overlooking the foggy emptiness that lurks beyond the cliff. She had some time for herself until Cammuravi and the others approached, Noah asking, "How are you feeling, Ethel?"</p>
<p>She turned to face them, "Ohhh, never better... I mean that literally. <strong>It's as though new strength is welling up</strong> inside of me. This way I'll be able to fight by your side too. You have my thanks."</p>
<p>"Huh..."</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Cammuravi?"</p>
<p>"<em>'Silvercoat'</em>."</p>
<p>"Ahhh!" Noah was surprised that word came into his mind.</p>
<p>Ethel herself don't understand, "'Silvercoat'...? What does that mean?"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "I'm... not sure... When I saw you just now, the word simply came to me... A-as though something was... guiding me... <strong>What in the world? This... sensation... from where did it spring?</strong>" His tone got excited.</p>
<p>Noah offered, "Cammuravi, I can explain..."</p>
<p>Before he could tell the story, Ethel chose another path, "What we should be thinking about now, is the future... What we can achieve in unison... No?"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh...</em>"</p>
<p>"I said I could be your eyes... That has not changed. Just as you showed me the <strong>Way</strong> before, let me now be your guide."</p>
<p>"You are right!" And he walked forward to stand beside her, her eyes following his face, continued, "You can see that which I cannot, indeed..." Looking towards her before tilting it back down in thoughts, he shared, "I wanted to live life true to myself, but the answer is still not clear. But... perhaps, by working together with you..."</p>
<p>Ethel turned around and face the same direction as him, offered, "Let's search for the answer hand in hand, Cammuravi. With unity between us, nothing can be impossible." And they exchanged glance, before all looking beyond the misty foggy way that they won't know where it'll lead; but they'll walk the path, step by step, to craft their future. It is theirs!</p>

<p>At Colony Lambda, the group and Isurd were standing at the elevated platform outside the commander's tent, overlooking the other infrastructures. Isurd asked, "Looking at Colony Lambda now, wouldn't you agree that it's recovered some of its spirit?"</p>
<p>Mio agreed, "Definitely. The atmosphere feels different to how things were, even a little while ago."</p>
<p>"Perhaps the change isn't a vast one, but something is indeed different. <strong>If we hadn't met you</strong>, perhaps this change wouldn't have taken place. We'd have retreated into our shells."</p>
<p>Noah pushed back the praises, "All we did was give things a little push. I'm sure you'd have managed this by yourself, Isurd."</p>
<p>"Hm. You are most kind. Either way, that doesn't change the heap of problems I'm facing. They need fixing, but I can only manage a few at a time."</p>
<p>Taion: "It's not good if you push yourself too hard, Commander. Getting some rest is important too."</p>
<p>As if 'are you kidding me?', "<em>Rest?</em> Hmm... Not sure how I'd go about getting some rest... <strong>The way things are here</strong>, I always end up busy, almost without intending to."</p>
<p>Sena: "I suppose as long as you're at your home colony, <em>things just turn out that way, huh...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz added, "And you know, we ain't exactly <em>experts in the art of taking a load off.</em>"</p>
<p>Taion had something in his mind, "That reminds me..."</p>
<p>Noah asked, "Do you have an idea, Taion?"</p>
<p>To not keep them being too optimistic, "<strong>Well...</strong> This could turn out to be nothing. But earlier, I heard a Nopon merchant talking about something called a 'natural spa'."</p>
<p>Isurd: "A 'spa'?" What does that even mean?</p>
<p>He nodded, "Supposedly it's in a remote place, not easily reachable by people."</p>
<p>Eunie didn't manage to join the dots, teasingly questioned, "What's <em>remoteness</em> got to do with getting poor Isurd here to relax?"</p>
<p>Taion relate to it scientifically, "The Nopon also said it contained lots of nutrients, stimulated metabolism, promoted blood circulation..."</p>
<p>Mio asked for a more humane explanation, "So you're saying, if we get our hands on this 'spa', then even Isurd could get some rest... He'll be able to recover, basically?"</p>
<p>"Like I said before, the information is questionable. It's only something I heard in passing."</p>
<p>"...Taion." That was very kind of you, to care about me.</p>
<p>"Commander! I'm sorry, I know it's hardly a credible source..."</p>
<p>He's getting excited, "<strong>I think I like the sound of this!</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Huh?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>I say we go out, and we find this 'spa' thing!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie got a little excited, "I'm not really one to talk, but I didn't think you'd be so into this."</p>
<p>"Well, I have a passing interest in things of that ilk. <em>But... ah</em>. I don't want to keep you from your journey..."</p>
<p>Lanz shook that thought off, "<strong>Naaaaahhhh</strong>, don't you worry about that. More importantly, how do we go about finding this thing?"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Why don't we ask somebody in the City?"{{footnote: As if people there would have heard of it? Why not track down the Nopon earlier and ask him/her about it? Isn't that more straightforward?}}</p>
<p>Mio agreed, "Right, better than just us racking our brains about it."</p>
<p>"My thanks, all of you."</p>
<p>Taion: "Just leave it to us, Commander. We'll give this our undivided attention."</p>
<hr />
<p>Seated at the City's square where they'd been promised cooking outside the dorm, after asking around the city, Taion refocused on the main question, "So... what do we know about natural spas? To summarize, hardly much of anything, except that they can heal and restore you."</p>
<p>Sena: "We didn't get the most concrete info, huh? Nobody's even been to one."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Look at this poor clod... Isurd's so haggard, I think we're gonna lose him."</p>
<p>Isurd actually followed them to the City, can't believe what he'd just heard, "Just how do I look to you...?"</p>
<p>Noah: "One thing for sure, we're not gonna find one with what we've got so far."</p>
<p>Mio added: "We've no clue where one actually could be... Like, in a forest, under a cliff?"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Yeah, realistically, we can't just blindly search everywhere."</p>
<p>Sena: "But it does sound kinda cool, right? Just soaking your body and somehow healing?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, but soaking in what? It sounds a lot like a bath. It can't just be a bath, right?" Their visual experience limit their imaginations so far.</p>
<p>Taion: "From the way they talked, I thought the same, but I've never been in a bath that healed my wounds."</p>
<p>"Maybe it's a question of using the right soap?"{{footnote: AHAHAHAHA medical soap.}}</p>
<p>Taion didn't dwell on that topic for too long, turned to apologize to Isurd, "Sir, I hate to think we've wasted your time, but if we can't come up with any more results..."</p>
<p>"Heh, I'm grateful for your concern, but honestly, I've been enjoying myself. We might not find anything, after all our searching, but there's just something in all this talk... Just hearing that gave my heart a much-needed jolt... Though that might not be the best way to put it." Being around with friends are always refreshing, eh!</p>
<p>Noah: "No, I think you have it right."</p>
<p>Mio agreed, "Yeah, I'd be lying if I said I didn't care what happens. Let's keep searching for a little bit longer."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Then let's go ask the bloke that people said would know about this whole spa business."</p>
<p>Sena: "What, that trivia king guy? Or the supposedly-dead guy?{{footnote: Bro, supposedly-dead guy? He was supposed to be dead but climbed out of his grave to tell you stories?}}"</p>
<p>Taion noted, "The report of his death could still turn out to have been a mite exaggerated."</p>
<p>Noah added another doubt, "We don't know whether trivia king and this dead-or-not guy are the same person, but it's worth finding out."</p>
<p>Isurd: "I know I've said it before, but I've certainly saddled you with a tough task..."</p>
<p>Lanz got impatient hearing that, "<strong>Ah, enough of that!</strong> We're giving you spirits a lift and all that. Once we find this natural spa, we'll chuck you right in it!"</p>
<p>"Haha! Then you had better really find it!"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the top of some building in the City, they found a guy overlooking the City from atop. There was little fence on the edge, so if he wanted to just jump off and kill himself, he could. While he had his attention on the horizon, Isurd started speaking, "Excuse me, kind sir."</p>
<p>The guy named Kotan turned around with heightened adrenaline, "<strong>What, what?</strong> A bunch of hoodlums. Trying to, gang up on an <em>old man, eh</em>?" He wore a hat, short-sleeves T-shirt and long pants, all black.</p>
<p>"No sir. We are searching for a natural spa."</p>
<p>"<strong>What did you say?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Uh we're searching-..."</p>
<p>He didn't wait for him to finish explaining, cut him, "<strong>If it's spas you're asking about, I</strong> <em>am who you need to be talking to!</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz can't take this old man, "<strong>We are talking to you, mate!</strong>"{{footnote: Yeah, this isn't the first time Lanz can't take an old man. If you'd read <a href="./91_melia.html">Melia</a>, you'd know he also cannot take on another old man.}}</p>
<p>"<em>Well then.</em> <strong>So you're the kids going round making NOISE about SPAS! YOU THINK talking to ME, is the way to get at ALL. MY. SECRETS? You</strong> might be whippersnappers, <em>ahah, but I can <strong>respect</strong> that kind of grit!</em>"</p>
<p>Sena started to asked quietly, feeling the guy's sanity is questionable, "<em>Um... You think he actually knows anything?</em>"</p>
<p>Mio didn't have her hopes high, "<em>I'm wondering...</em>"</p>
<p>Taion explained to Kotan: "We heard that there was someone who knew much about spas, but that he had passed away."</p>
<p>And he got mad, "<strong>What did that</strong> old codger tell you?! <strong>I ain't dying anytime soon!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz snap to the point, "Mind telling us about the spas, then?"</p>
<p>Then he started preaching, "<strong>When I was young, I used to go around them all, ANNNDDD a lot. Hehehe there were about... f-four of them.</strong> <em>The one that I liked the most</em>, <strong>was the</strong> Nordil- Natural- <em>Spa</em>. <strong>At the time my back was killing me, BUT ONE DIP</strong> ho ha he and it was healed. <strong>AMAZING!</strong> <em>The odd thing was,</em> it was just a footbath! <strong>I did my feet in, and it HEALED MY BACK!</strong> Huh huh oh, what genius came up with that, eh? <strong>I only ever found, FOUR, natural spas,</strong> but I'd also heard <strong>rumors</strong> of another, <strong>SECRET</strong> one, huh huh I bet it'd do marvels for one's back!"</p>
<p>Eunie lost her patience, "Mate, we didn't come here to chat about your flippin' back!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Eh?</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah explained their objectives, "We want to know where we can find a spa. If there's four of them, then you can-"</p>
<p>He shook his head, "<strong>OHHH</strong>, they're long gone."</p>
<p>Sena, in a high-pitched tone of 'amusement', "<strong>WHAAAATTTTT???</strong>"</p>
<p>Isurd: "Gone, <strong>you say?</strong>"</p>
<p>"Thanks to kids like you, <em>with your</em> <strong>wars</strong>, and whatever... <strong>They've been blown up</strong>, filled in..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Huh?"</p>
<p>"<strong>Natural</strong> <em>spas</em> need water that <strong>gushes out of the ground.</strong> No gush, no spring. Errr you <em>might</em> find something if you start- digging, though."</p>
<p>Lanz can't believe what he'd just heard, "Dig. That's your advice?"</p>
<p>And he shook his head, "Though in times like these, start digging <strong>holes</strong> and <strong>people'll think</strong> you're crazy.{{footnote: So you know and you asked us to dig???}}"</p>
<p>Taion, with a sigh, "Well, you certainly turned out to be a font of knowledge. <em>I don't regret this at all.</em>"</p>
<p>Isurd turned to calm him, "<em>Don't take it to heart, Taion</em>. We tried our best. We'll just have to accept the result. We may not have found a natural spa but, the time we spent was still worthwhile."</p>
<p>"I suppose, Commander..."</p>
<p>"<strong>YOU- suppose- nothing! You</strong> should let someone <strong>finish</strong> when they're talking!{{footnote: Now that rhymes!}} <em>Huh</em>, There's still the... <em>secret spa that I couldn't find.</em> <strong>O-o-o-o-o-or</strong>, to be more precise, <em>err there might be... urm...</em>"</p>
<p>Lanz: "<strong>What, REALLY?</strong>"</p>
<p>"I-I-I-I <strong>heard this</strong> when I was still <em>young, so</em> <strong>it- might- not- be-</strong> ummm... <em>too credible...</em> <strong>B-b-but</strong> <em>uh</em>, <strong>the rumor goes</strong> that there was one in the urrr Brasa- Geothermal- Belt. But I... <em>couldn't make it. The place, was crawling with monsters,</em> <strong>IN-SIDE and</strong> out."</p>
<p>Isurd: "So there is hope after all?"</p>
<p>"Looong time <em>ago</em>... lots of people <em>took refuge there, but...</em> not- one- of- them- <em>came- back. That's, how dangerous the place is. So...</em> <strong>the spa,</strong> <em>might be there, it might not</em>. That's why I <em>couldn't, recommend</em> the place to you."</p>
<p>Lanz was excited to hear new news, "<strong>There we go then, eh Isurd?</strong>" As for the monsters, to hell with the monsters!</p>
<p>Adventurous, he was equally excited, "Indeed! It might be there... it might not... <strong>The more uncertain it sounds, the more it gets me excited!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie couldn't understand, "Weirdo. <strong>What if it turns out</strong> to be a massive waste of time?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I never thought I'd get so excited at searching for something unknown.</strong>"</p>
<p>Kotan can empathize with his excitement, "<strong>Ho ho ho! Soak yourself in the spa the way you're getting NOW</strong>, and you're liable to <strong>BROIL</strong> yourself to <em>death</em> uhuh!"</p>
<p>"Hmph. I'll take care. Thank you kindly!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oops!</strong> Ur urg... Nearly forgot <em>to tell you.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "Hm?"</p>
<p>"<strong>How to</strong> properly use the <strong>spa</strong> heh! <strong>Pin your ears back</strong>, and listen."</p>
<hr />
<p>They went to the place and found a pond with evaporating liquid, clearly warmer pool of liquid. Isurd questioned, "So, this is the... 'spa'?"</p>
<p>Eunie exclaimed, "<strong>So it IS just a great big stonking bath!</strong>" A great pool of warm water, eh! The surrounding was rocky with a few desert-ish plants.</p>
<p>Taion disagreed, "Looks can be deceiving. They told us it has <em>special</em> properties, remember?"</p>
<p>Sena noted, "The humidity is <strong>insane</strong>... Do you think the water's hot?" Then, she knelt down and held her hand over the evaporating mist.</p>
<p>Just then, Noah and the others felt something, "Huh? Hold it, something's here!" And some tirkins emerged out from underneath the bath.</p>
<p>Isurd: "Seems we're not the first visitors today."</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>Weapons ready!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>After resolving the tirkins, Lanz sighed, "Huh! Those guys... They healed up something <strong>CRAZY!</strong>"{{footnote: Surprisingly, there's no blood or any body juice or any body shards that tainted the pool, eh!}}</p>
<p>That made Isurd thinking, "Was that... an effect of the spa's waters?"</p>
<p>Eunie refused to think too much about it, "<strong>Does it matter any more?</strong> Now you can just dive right on it."</p>
<p>Sena hesitated, "Huh? But, err..."</p>
<p>Eunie peered over her shoulder to the left at Lanz, whom got her message, "Right! Ready, Isurd?"</p>
<p>He turned around to look at the approaching two, with Eunie adding, "As promised, time for us to chuck you in!"</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH H-HOLD UP!!! I DON'T REMEMBER MAKING ANY-</strong>" He hadn't finished shouting when two hands shoved him forward and he fell on his back onto the waters.</p>
<p>Taion was shocked at such brutality, "<strong>WHA-? What is the meaning of this? Commander! Are you OK?</strong>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HURRRRRR</strong>" He floated back up from below the waters, gasped for air, before replying, "Other than my heart, I believe I'm quite all right, thank you."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Just like the old man said. <em>If there's nobody there</em>, it's good manners to jump <strong>right</strong> in."</p>
<p>To which Taion immediately rebut, "<strong>Even so, that's not-</strong>"</p>
<p>Isurd cut him short, stating his observations, "However, the water is good."</p>
<p>Noah knelt down so he could look at him without tilting his head down too large an angle before questioning, "What does it feel like?"</p>
<p>"The- temperature is very pleasant."</p>
<p>Eunie had her 'proof': "So like I've been saying, it's just a bath!"</p>
<p>"Look! My wounds are closing as we speak!"</p>
<p>Mio was impressed, "<strong>Wow!</strong> So what that man was saying... It wasn't entirely wrong, it looks like."</p>
<p>"Yes... Now that I'm in here... I don't think I ever want to leave."</p>
<p>"<strong>Right, my turn then.</strong>" And he start taking steps forward and slid himself into the pool. Sitting down in the water beside Isurd, he looked up at the others, questioned, "<strong>Oi!</strong> What's wrong with you? <strong>Everybody</strong> get in!"</p>
<p>Mio was surprised, "<strong>HUH?</strong>" And she exchanged glance with Sena. Not just for Isurd? And...</p>
<p>Isurd continued to make observations: "My word... I'm healing in places I didn't even know I had! <strong>Aren't you coming in? The water's fine.</strong>"</p>
<p>"B-but I, uh..." Mio and Sena were standing behind, hands and heads down on the floor, as if they didn't heard. Taion, standing in front of both of them, was trying to find an excuse to not, looked back at Sena to try find help from them. Alas, they're not even looking at him.</p>
<p>Lanz was too tired hearing his excuse, "<strong>URRRRRRHHHHHaaahhh</strong>, I'm coming <strong>baaaacccck to life!</strong> Uh, <em>not that I was dead or anything.</em>"</p>
<p>"Umm..." Noah now joined the three that was hesitant, with Sena trying to break the ice. "Would I... have to strip down?" Mio blushed a bit at the question, still looking down at the floor, changing to a more pleasant posture.</p>
<p>Noah scratched his head, answering the question with a proxy answer, "<strong>Ohhhh</strong>, right... The old man, he <strong>did</strong> say there's a proper way for getting in the water."</p>
<p>Mio: "But I-... I mean....R-... r-... right here?"</p>
<p>Lanz urged: "<strong>Hey guys</strong>, where's your sense of culture? <strong>Get in already!</strong> You don't want it getting cold!"</p>
<p>Isurd added, "It's perfect for healing your wounds after a grueling battle."</p>
<p>"Um! B-but... Commander..."</p>
<p>"You can be hopeless... <strong>Eunie, boot him in already, will ya?</strong>"</p>
<p>Teasingly and eagerly, "<strong>Roger that!</strong>" She bent down and get herself targeting Taion, whom tilted back defensively.</p>
<p>"Now, <strong>WAIT HERE A MINUTE, EUNIE!!! I NEVER SAID I WAS GOING INNNN-!!!</strong>" Too late!</p>
<hr />
<p>After the bath, everyone got up and formed a circle beside the pool, Taion was still having his head huge, "Spark! <em>Why did it have to end like this?</em>"</p>
<p>Isurd was having fun, "Hahahah! Taion, it's a good experience for you! It wasn't so bad, was it?"</p>
<p>"Uh, well... Now that you ask..."</p>
<p>Eunie agreed, "Yeah, takin' a dip wasn't bad at all!"</p>
<p>Sena weakly agreed, "<em>Right...</em>"</p>
<p>Mio agreed with full of energy, "All my tiredness is just completely gone!"</p>
<p>Noah asked Isurd, "Did you enjoy your break?"</p>
<p>"<em>I did!</em> Thanks to you, I feel as if a weight's been lifted from my heart. I believed I was working for the colony but, really, I was running myself into the ground."</p>
<p>Mio: "So it was worth coming here."</p>
<p>Isurd: "It just shows that there's room in any heart to appreciate the finer things. This has given me a lot to think about. At some point I'll have to bring <em>everyone</em> in the colony here."</p>
<p>Eunie teased: "If you could make everyone fit. In a space like this, people will have to take turns. The lines will get long."</p>
<p>"<em>Heh</em>... Then perhaps we need to dig some more holes. We might even discover some new springs."</p>
<p>Sena can't believe her ears, "You're really serious?"</p>
<p>"Once the fighting ends, and people have more free time, then I might give it some serious thought. Digging a few holes shouldn't pose us too much of a challenge. We are miners, after all. <em>But wait...</em> If we can discover many more of these spas, <strong>we could bring in people</strong> from other colonies..."</p>
<p>Lanz foreseen the situation, shook his head, "<em>Uh-oh...</em>"</p>
<p>Noah excitedly replied, "Looks like you've caught the spa bug, Isurd!"</p>
<p>Taion knew him well enough, explained to the others, "Times like this are when the commander shines the brightest."</p>
<p>Mio: "Uhuh... Bet you're glad we helped him, Taion."</p>
<p>"<strong>Yes</strong>. I think he's going to be an even greater <em>help to us now.</em>"</p>
<p>Isurd urged, "Shall we be off? Our next objective awaits."</p>

<p>The group was exiting the blood-red-lit factory of Keves Castle towards the alleyway when they were met with someone whom tried to keep a low profile. Stopping in her track, she asked to "Excuse me." and quickly walked in between them, hoping them not to take notice of her, but Mio recognized,</p>
<p>"That voice..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Wait... I know who you are!" That halted her in her position.</p>
<p>Before they could speak more, Aizel, one whom were searching for and catching after her, nervously called out from where she had came from, "Your Majesty!" He therefore surrounded the group in a semicircle with the accompanying soldiers.</p>
<p>Melia shook her head and sighed, "Hngh... Did it fail?"</p>
<p>She walked past the group and approached Aizel, "I understand... how you feel, but... you must think of your own well-being! <em>Please... have patience, I beg you!</em>"</p>
<p>She frustratingly replied, "Surely I've been patient enough. Stuck there in Origin, it's enough to send one insane."</p>
<p>Mio cut into their conversation, "Um... Can we help you?"</p>
<p>Aizel explained, "Her Majesty is insistent that she explore the outside world undercover..."</p>
<p>"I wanted to see for myself what the beings of this world thought, what they needed. Until now, all I could do was perceive data... But no longer."</p>
<p>"I know, yes, but... if you simply gave us the order, we could perform all the legwork for you..."</p>
<p>"There are things you can't understand unless you experience them for yourself."</p>
<p>Another Castle soldier persuaded, "Then, at least allow us to accompany you!"</p>
<p>"If I go with you, <em>won't that draw attention?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested thereafter, "How about if we went with you? We're quite well-traveled around Aionios now. There are plenty of places we could show you around, I'm sure."</p>
<p>Mio added, "And of course, we share a common goal. There are people out there living in the harshest conditions, yet still they struggle on. We want to help them all too, just like you."</p>
<p>"You want to help?"</p>
<p>Manana: "More people makes for more merries! Would be mega merries with more Melia!"</p>
<p>Taion lectured, "Manana, you must refer to Her Highness in the proper manner."</p>
<p>"<em>Manana speak improper?</em> Oh, that right. Many sorries, Melly!"</p>
<p>That alerted Aizel, "<strong>M-MELLY?!</strong>" The growth of such improperness after given a second chance to rephrase herself.</p>
<p>Taion begged for pardon therefore, "Please, Your Highness, forgive our insolence!"</p>
<p>Manana still couldn't understand the situation, "<em>Oh, Taion did a boo-boo?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em><strong>I</strong> didn't</em>."</p>
<p>Melia was reminded long ago when some Nopon "Ahah... It's been a long time since anyone called me that. Then I have a proposal. They will be my only guards."</p>
<p>Aizel still tried to convince her to change her thoughts, "<em>Your Majesty, why must you do this? What necessitates it? You have only just returned! You are the hope of all Keves! Should the unthinkable happen, then-</em>"</p>
<p>"You're such a fusspot, Aizel. But I want you to understand. The future is not shouldered by me alone. It's something that's created by each and every person in the world. I never wanted to sit there in my ivory tower and gaze down from on high. That's not the kind of ruler I am."</p>
<p>"<em>I apologize. I spoke out of turn.</em>"</p>
<p>"I'm not criticizing you. You are what I wanted. You are my hope." Then, turning to Noah and his group, "I have a request... Or rather, something to discuss. Could I ask you to take a fellow traveler under your wing? Her name is Melia."</p>
<p>Taion: "If that's... truly what you wish for."</p>
<p>Noah: "I don't see why not. Glad to have you with us, Melia."</p>
<p>Lanz: "Talking to the Queen on equal footing... That's crazy, mate!"{{footnote: Well, the more crazy you had Queen Nia standing behind you!}}</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Yeah, I'm gonna feel so awkward...</em>"</p>
<p>Riku: "No need for stress. Just act natural." Well, she's your Shifu, of course you don't stress...</p>
<p>"Ohhh, stomach of Manana getting rumbly!" That's not even related, Manana.</p>
<p>"...Maybe some stress for Manana."</p>
<p>Melia: "Ahahah!" Eunie tilted her head to her side looking at Melia, and noticing her actions, she would like to know "What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"Our wings..." She prick the tip of her wings to show, "Your High-... Sorry, I still can't believe you have them too, Melia. Makes me feel special. Like we're the same."</p>
<p>"Right. We are the same."{{footnote: Half-homs half High Entia, yes.}}</p>
<p>Aizel: "Your Majesty..." He did the Kevesi welcoming stance, "I urge you, <strong>please</strong> take care..."</p>
<p>"I'll be relying on you in my absence, Aizel." Turning back to the group, "I'm sorry to saddle you all with me, everyone. But I'm looking forward to it too."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the Queen's chamber where the birth pods were, one Queen's Aide (whom had no name) was debating with Aizel, "You're having a laugh. You think this is going to make it all better, do you?"</p>
<p>"I will bear full responsibility! Otherwise... Well, there is no 'otherwise'!"</p>
<p>Melia, accompanied by the Ouroboros, had returned from their journey and overheard their debate. She therefore sternly questioned, "What <em>are</em> you two bickering about?"</p>
<p>Despite the sternness, it doesn't prevent Aizel from showing his delight, "Your Majesty... What a welcome sight, to see you return!"</p>
<p>"Has a problem arisen in my absence?" She kept her sternness, skipped the flattering and redirected the conversation back to her main concern.</p>
<p>In denial or just don't want her to worry about it, he shook his head and lightly denied, "Ah, no no... Just a trifling matter, really..."</p>
<p>The Aide insisted instead that Melia be informed about it than dealing with it themselves, "Actually, we do have a bit of a problem on our hands, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>Aizel quietly tried to convince him from taking his words back, "<em>Hey! Mind your-</em>"</p>
<p>"We have to report the facts as they are. How much longer are you going to leave this hanging, eh?"</p>
<p>"...Tch."</p>
<p>Noah prompted, "What's the problem?"</p>
<p>Aide: "Couple of days ago, we had a small run-in with our Agnian opposites. Aizel took care of them, but things got out of hand a little bit..."</p>
<p>He nervously refuted, "<em>'Out of hand', nothing! They insulted Her Majesty's honor! I'm spitting feathers!</em>"</p>
<p>"But we'd no reason to fight. <strong>You were the one who earned their ire!</strong>"</p>
<p>Melia: "Did they come to any harm? You hurt them?"</p>
<p>"<em>I'd only intended to, er, scare them. But, then they resisted...</em>"</p>
<p>"So you sought to defeat them."</p>
<p>"<strong>NO! Nothing of the sort! They had no Flame Clocks, so I would never-</strong>"</p>
<p>"The presence of a Flame Clock is not what instigates a battle. The glimmerings of war are always there, within us. I imagine discovering that fact must have come as quite a shock to you."</p>
<p>"Huh..." He still shook his head in denial.</p>
<p>Taion: "Circumstances aside, if you've incited their wrath, <em>then I assume we haven't heard the end of this.</em>"</p>
<p>The Aide confirmed his hypothesis, "As you say, they have since begun to rally together in opposition."</p>
<p>Aizel dropped his head, "I am ashamed... <em>Truly... ashamed.</em> Now that this has come to a head, I cannot but take full responsibility... I will thwart their objective, even if it should cost me my life!"</p>
<p>Melia sternly refuted, "<strong>You shall not! Do not speak of throwing your life away so lightly!</strong> I've already lost so many of my friends. I could not bear to lose another..."</p>
<p>"<em>Your Majesty...</em>"</p>
<p>"I told you, did I not? You are my hope. I will speak to the Agnian chief retainer personally about the matter. <strong>In the meantime, cool your head.</strong>"</p>
<p>"Haish..."</p>
<p>"Any more unfinished business that I should know about?"</p>
<p>The Aide added, "Couple of house calls to make, Your Majesty. They want you at Colony 9 and the City."</p>
<p>Noah: "Colony 9? So Zeon, then?"</p>
<p>Aizel assured him, "Indeed. They've asked for some urgent backup following the recent Origin attack."</p>
<p>Aide: "And the other request is from Monica. Wants you to give her people a pep talk."</p>
<p>Melia: "The descendants of Ouroboros... <em>I've caused such grief for them, and for an unfathomably long time.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah assured, "But now they get to speak to their real Queen. I'm sure they'll be overjoyed."</p>
<p>"Yes, perhaps... Speaking face to face with another... <em>There's nothing</em> quite like it."</p>
<p>"Um, Melia...?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. I'm afraid I'm going to be taking up some more of your time..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Mhm... Now, you can cut that out. Agnus or Keves, soldier or Queen... <strong>What difference does it make?</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie added, "The future is to be created by each and every person in the world. I think you were the one who taught us that."</p>
<p>"True enough. Your unyielding spirit... <em>gives me the strength to go on</em>."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, thinking in his head, "<em>Sometimes when Melia smiles... I see sadness in her eyes. As if she's all alone in the world...</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Lanz pushed the agenda forward when everyone finished speaking, "Well, better start making the rounds. We've gotta stop by Colony 9, the City, and..."</p>
<p>Sena added, "Agnus Castle, right?"</p>
<p>Aizel and the aide did the welcoming stance, the former speaking, "Safe journey to you all."</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the war room, Monica was surprised at Melia's arrival, "<strong>Your Majesty...?!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Sorry to bother you... I'm sure you're rushed enough as it is. I'm here to discuss the speech you mentioned... Did I... come at a bad time?"</p>
<p>"<strong>No, not at all!</strong> We've been stretching our necks every day waiting to see if you'd turn up."</p>
<p>"I too have been... anxious to meet you. I'm sorry, to have been a source of anguish for you this long."</p>
<p>"It's all been for today. I don't consider any of it a waste." And Melia nodded with thanks. "Now, onto the matter at hand: rallying the troops. With the final battle with Moebius looming before us, we're doing our best to prepare, but we need more than just supplies. A battle to determine the fate of the world is hardly a light topic. Everyone's beside themselves with worry... Some poor souls have completely snapped. <strong>We're never going to</strong> last in actual combat at this rate."</p>
<p>"I don't blame them. No matter how noble our cause, the fighting <em>will</em> cost us lives. We're caught between the future we desire, and the present, which is ours to lose. It's a place beset on all sides by fear."</p>
<p>Eunie empathized with that, "<em>You got that right. Especially when there's no guarantee you're gonna be coming home.</em>"</p>
<p>Monica: "Even a brief address would do. Just as long as you speak to them somehow."</p>
<p>"I understand. I don't know if I'll be able to get through to them, but I will try."</p>
<p>Noah offered himself, "We'll be your guides while in the City, make sure you don't lose your bearings."</p>
<p>"That would be most appreciated. While we're here, would it bother you if I took a look around the City itself?"</p>
<p>"Please, be my guest. <em>I think we'd all like that.</em>"</p>
<p>Noah suggested, "Maybe we could take her to Centrilo Parade? There's plenty of people around there."</p>
<p>"No objections from me, but... there are some rather... shall we say, ardent followers of the Queen up that way. If they get too insistent, you might need to give them a friendly nudge." So a surprise then!</p>
<p>"<em>Oh yeah? All right, we'll keep a lookout.</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>At Centrilo Parade, one or two people, and one Nopon walked past them. Michiba Canteen cornered at the turn of the alleyway. Containers, tables, chairs, barrels, lie on one side, while one-storey shop on the other side. The alleyway was roofed with some clothing. Orange lights mounted on the horizontal beams that made up the roofs provided lighting for the alleyway.</p>
<p>Melia shared her thoughts, "Now this is a far cry from the colonies and the Castles. Here is a place where people can truly live... make a home."</p>
<p>Eunie shared hers too, "I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw this place. All these different people I'd never seen before. Things of all shapes and sizes..."</p>
<p>"I wish I had been there to see your reaction. A shame."</p>
<p>That gets her excited, "And see my mouth hanging open like a lummox? Not worth it!"</p>
<p>Noah noticed, "You seem to take it all in your stride. None of this surprises you?"</p>
<p>"It's more that I'm assailed by old memories. Technologies of old are put into practice here. I feel the industry of those times." Suddenly, people came out of nowhere and dashed and surrounded the group, shocking her, "<strong>Huh?</strong>"</p>
<p>An elderly man (labeled 'A') excitedly questioned, "Is that... really you? Queen... Melia?"</p>
<p>"Err... Yes, I do go by that name..."</p>
<p>"<strong>IIIIIIIIII KNEW IT!!!! I knew it from the moment I laid eyes on you.</strong> You were something special!" Now that's the 'ardent followers' Monica said.</p>
<p>As he completed, two Ouroboros candidates huffed and puffed as they caught up with the old man, stopped slightly behind him, and Jansen commented, "Huff... Finally caught up..."</p>
<p>Nissick: "Hey old man, you're gonna give yourself a heart attack."</p>
<p>"<strong>Wahaha thanks for your concern</strong>, but I'll decide when and how I'm going to pop my clogs! I've lived my whole life for this day... <strong>HECK, you all have, haven't you?</strong>" And they turned to see the people at the back.</p>
<p>Another Middle Aged Guy A spoke, "Huh, of course we have!"</p>
<p>Middle Aged Lady A: "You've returned to us at last, my Queen! You <strong>really</strong> are as <strong>radiant</strong> as they say..."</p>
<p>Even Michiba joined in, inviting, "Heeeeeey, fancy a bite? You should come by my restaurant, sample a few of the local dishes!"</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy B refuted, "Hey, nobody wants to see your seedy little bistro! She wants something memorable!"</p>
<p>"<strong>Oh!</strong> Say that again, I dare you! If you hate my establishment so much, I'll be more than happy to <strong>bar you from it, permanently!</strong>"</p>
<p>Kryto walked between the two and shouted commands, "<strong>All right, people, don't shove!</strong> And stop arguing! We don't wanna scare the Queen now."</p>
<p>Kryto Groupie A (his fan, one guesses): "<strong>OH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Kryto Groupie B: "<strong>MY!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Kryto Groupie C: "<strong>DAYS!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Kryto Groupie A, in the sharpest and highest tone one can possibly made, "<strong>KRYTO!!!</strong>" These three were waving their hands like fans ever since the group arrived. Thought they were waving at the Queen, but seemingly not...</p>
<p>Taion was getting scared at these reactions, "<em>Come on now, this is getting excessive...</em>"</p>
<p>Cyma (another one of the Ouroboros candidate, probably) proposed not, "Ah, leave 'em. Everyone's been living for this moment."</p>
<p>Olive added, "It's always been my dream to see the true Queen come back to us... A lot of us die before we get the chance."</p>
<p>Kryto: "Yeah, but now it's actually happening! Before our very eyes! How can we possibly keep calm when a miracle is unfolding?"</p>
<p>Melia: "I am so grateful to you all, my people. I would like to express a few words of gratitude, if I may. It is a joy to see real human activity once again, after all these years. I see that you continue to remain strong."</p>
<p>Michiba: "'Course we do! Gotta protect what we love, right?"</p>
<p>Elderly Man A: "That's right. I'm not resting these old bones so long as there's life in 'em!"</p>
<p>Nissick: "<strong>We'll hold out for decades more if we have to!</strong>"</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy A: "We have our Queen, and even Ouroboros stand by her side!"</p>
<p>Jansen: "With their strength behind us, Moebius won't stand a chance!"</p>
<p>Noah, seeing the spirit high, quietly told Melia, "Looks like that takes care of that."</p>
<p>"Indeed." She agreed.</p>
<p>Eunie was impressed, "Wow... 'Decades' plural... And here we are, happy enough if we can reach one."</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy B shared his view, "The way I see it, you lot are far more incredible. You've achieved so much in so little time."</p>
<p>Eunie seemed to take it for granted, "Huh? That's only natural, ain't it? Gotta get stuff done in the time you have. No way I could imagine having to fight for 40 or 50 years... Feels so snuffin' far away..."</p>
<p>Melia: "Eunie..."</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy C suddenly changed topic, "By the by, I'm not seeing the Storyspinner anywhere."</p>
<p>Who is this "Storyspinner?" Melia would like to know more.</p>
<p>Olive explained it, "He's this old guy who knows more about the City's history than anyone. He's like a walking encyclopedia!" Really?</p>
<p>Cyma added, "Real curious bloke. Normally he'd jump at an opportunity like this..."</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy C: "He's no spring Tirkin, though. If he hears he's missed his chance to meet Her Majesty, he might drop dead from the shock..."</p>
<p>Melia was shocked, "Heavens..." Couldn't indirectly causing someone's death, isn't it? "Where might we find this person? I think we should pay him a visit."</p>
<p>Eunie was surprised, "What, really?"</p>
<p>Middle Aged Guy C: "I'll bet it'd make his day, <strong>but are you sure?</strong>"</p>
<p>"I would like to try to meet him, if at all possible."</p>
<p>Noah: "As you wish. It's your call."</p>
<p>Cyma suggested, "You'll probably find him at Mitia Lookout. I hear it's one of his favorite spots."</p>
<hr />
<p>At Mitia Lookout, a huge empty balcony that viewed out into the emptiness. Only three stalactite-looking pillars dangling at one side, and all else is misty, foggy, and shrouded. The group found Taleb overlooking afar, "Oi! What's all the fuss? Whose funeral is it this time?" The white-haired brown-shirt guy turned around and looked at the group.</p>
<p>Melia replied to him, "Nobody's, I should hope. We were just wondering if-..."</p>
<p>She didn't managed to finish her sentence when Taleb shockingly gasped, "<strong>Hgwah?!!! Old Melly?!!!</strong> Oh... This- this can't be real, Somebody pinch me! What if... it's actually <strong>my funeral</strong>? Then that would mean... <em>Wh-where the blazes</em> have I ended up?!"</p>
<p>Eunie looked at him like seeing a fool, answering unconvincingly, "Yeah, uh, <em>this is Mitia Lookout? Innnnn the City?</em>"</p>
<p>Melia apologized, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to startle you. I'm told you have quite the wisdom. I was hoping to ask you a few things, if it doesn't bother you."</p>
<p>"Ahhhhh, I get ya. The Queen herself is asking me personally to tell her a story! Huh, now I know I'm dreaming... <strong>Hey, Ouroboros kids! Gimme a good wallop. Here, right on the kisser!</strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz was prepared for the job, "Sure thing." And he got forward and slapped him down to the ground.</p>
<p>Seeing him unconscious, the group gathered around the old man, while Melia shockingly questioned, "<strong>Have you gone quite mad?!</strong>" And everyone turned their head looking at him, unbelievable at what he'd just did.</p>
<p>Taion: "<em>Lanz...</em>"</p>
<p>"I-I didn't throw my weight into it!"</p>
<p>Mio couldn't take this nonsense anymore, "Let's all calm down for a second and just talk sensibly. Please."</p>
<hr />
<p>After he woke up, the group explained the situation to him. Taleb: "Ahh, I see... A rousing speech for the City, eh? What a stroke of luck! Even after that battering, I'll know I'll be content in the afterlife!"</p>
<p>Lanz complaint, "Oh, don't start! <strong>You were the one who asked us to!</strong>"</p>
<p>Excitedly, "Well, it seems life's worth living a little while longer. Don't want to disappoint old Queenie now, do I? Go on then. Ask away."</p>
<p>{{footnote: Here, you can choose what question to ask first. The video gamer chose "Has it been tough fighting on for decades?" first.}}Melia: "I hear you have accumulated a wealth of knowledge over the years. If you don't mind my asking... Is it not painful to know so much more than people around you, and be so much older?"</p>
<p>"Why, Melly, do you mean to say... you're worried about my ailments?!"</p>
<p>"...Pardon?" She got confused.</p>
<p>He probably got it wrong, thinking it physical than emotional/mental, "I've got arthritis, dermatitis, constipation... <strong>Bones are as brittle as all hell, and I can never get a wink of sleep!</strong> When I do sleep in, the doc's gotta come and check my breathing... Can't do what I used to. If it's not one thing, it's another!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "Yeah, that's not what she was talking about."</p>
<p>"Oh, aye? What was it, then?"</p>
<p>She rephrased Melia's sentence, "When you get to the age you are, after living for so many decades..." That conversation finished here.</p>
<p>{{footnote: Now the next: "How do you know of Melia?" selected.}}Sena: "I've been wondering... When you first saw Melia, I kinda got the impression you knew more about her than you let on...?"</p>
<p>"'Course I do! Have you seen the stacks of literature they've got here in the City? <strong>Packed to the rafters</strong>! There's passages on the true Queen, too. And you betcha these eyes have read 'em all back to front, twenty times over!"</p>
<p>"<em>So you know all about her?</em>"</p>
<p>And he nodded, "Naturally, naturally!{{footnote: No, of course you don't! How could you when Melia herself don't know all about herself?}} Here, I'll give you an example... It is a lesser-known fact that Her Majesty is <em>squeamish around</em> shiny bugs!"</p>
<p>Melia was shocked herself, "Wha... How can you possibly know that?!"</p>
<p>"There was also a little morsel about how she found Rainbow Bugs particularly revolting. They're extinct now, but uh, I reckon they're beasties about the <strong>size of your fist</strong>, whose bodily excretions make 'em glow, and-"</p>
<p>Melia cut him short, "<strong>All right, enough!</strong> You don't need to go into such detail! <em>The mere memory gives me <strong>goosebumps</strong>...</em>"</p>
<p>"Ohoho don't you worry, I've got plenty more tidbits like that up my sleeve!"</p>
<p>Eunie explained, "We don't want to hear it!... <em>Look, I'll tell you what I want to know.</em>"</p>
<p>"Oh yeah? I'm all ears."</p>
<p>"When you get to the age you are, after living for so many decades... you must've had to say goodbye to so many of your friends, and stuff. <em>Must be a lot of crap to deal with. So, uh... How do you cope?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>A ha ha ha</strong>, the pits is what it is! There are times when I wonder why I <strong>don't just curl up and die</strong>! But see... <strong><em>Life ain't all sunshine and roses.</em></strong> <em>I think that's part and parcel of it.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>So... what? You just have to go on living in misery?</em> <strong>You've gotta be joking</strong>..."</p>
<p>Taion: "Eunie, are you all right?"</p>
<p>She turned to him and explained, "<strong>I just wanna know what it's all about. Growing old</strong>. There's folk out there who get to live <em>so much longer</em> than us. And they still choose to fight. It just feels like I'm always taking a back seat. Like I'm getting left behind... But I wanna be there with you guys. Even if it's just <em>in</em> spirit..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Eunie... I had no idea that was how you felt."{{footnote: Well, you never asked, so she never told you before.}}</p>
<p>"<em>Yeah, sorry... Hard to... put it into words, really</em>."</p>
<p>Melia turned and shared to her, having live longer than almost everyone except Nia, age frozen when the time stopped, "Even if those you once loved are no longer a part of this world... Lonely as it is, and painful though the memories be, it's not wholly a tragic tale. <strong><em>For you can keep close to your heart your memories of those dear to you.</em></strong> <em>And that is something to take pride in.</em> <strong><em>That is what will give you strength.</em></strong> Admittedly, my life took a very different path to the likes of my companions here... <em>But such are my thoughts.</em>"</p>
<p>Taleb was hearing all along, "<strong>Ahh...! Never a truer word was spoken...</strong> That's one for the ages! Where's my notepad?"</p>
<p>While he searched for his notepad, Mio assured her, "The fact that you're worrying about us, here and now, Eunie... I don't think we'll ever forget that. Your feelings will transcend time..."</p>
<p>Noah: "<em>I'd have to agree.</em> So don't feel like you need to be doing anything special for us, Eunie. It's reassuring enough just being the way you are."</p>
<p>"<em>Hah... Don't suppose you've got any tissues on you?</em> Spark... Why'd you have to go and make it all soppy?" Well, you can cry, Eunie, if you'd like to. We won't mind.</p>
<p>Melia: "Nobody is leaving you behind, Eunie. <em>If you ever feel distance between you</em>, you need only speak out."</p>
<p>"Wait... Was this <strong>all</strong> just to tell me that...?"</p>
<p>Yeah, "That's about the size of it. Good luck out there, young'uns."</p>
<p>Lanz couldn't have disagreed more, "<strong>Don't just pass it off as your own speech!</strong>"</p>
<p>He didn't care about the grumbling, asked for a favor instead, "Say, Melly... Would you mind <em>if we shook hands?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HE'S STRAIGHT-UP IGNORING ME!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Melia: "I don't see why not...?"{{footnote: AHAHAH even Melly ignore you...}}</p>
<p>"Oh, you angel! Now I can shuffle off this mortal coil without regrets!"</p>
<p>Taion: "Ngh..." Don't just go die yet, bro!</p>
<p>Eunie: "Knowledgeable my arse..." What thing did we learn from him, except his disease, and knowing what Melly is scared of?</p>
<p>Taleb: "<strong><em>Life's a cruel journey from one end to the other. You only get one chance to walk it. But if there's one thing, that gives it all meaning, it's love.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "That's very sweet..."</p>
<p>"That ain't something I have to teach you young folk, though. <em>Your friends are lucky fellows.</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie recalled, "<em>Monica said something like that, too. Still doesn't make much sense to me, though...</em>"</p>
<p>"Ho ho ho... Well, <strong><em>love takes many forms. There are as many ways to show it as there are people.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>I'll remember that... Thanks.</em>"</p>
<p>Melia: "I hate to be the bearer of bad news, <em>but we should probably be getting on.</em> Till we meet again, Storyspinner."</p>
<p>"Indeed, indeed. Safe travels to you, Your Majesty."</p>
<hr />
<p>At Colony 9. Zeon was overlooking the many soldiers lying inside the medical tent. One of the soldier whom Zeon stood beside his bed, Kurt,scorned, "Oof, that'll leave a bruise... <strong>Be more gentle, Commander!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Urg... Don't expect miracles. I'm trying my best to heal you here."</p>
<p>"Here, let me." Melia and the others arrived just in time to take over the healing.</p>
<p>He turned to apologize, "Thank you, miss. That would be gr-... Wha...?! You're..."</p>
<hr />
<p>After Melia used her healing skills, Kurt was already sitting on his bed, and Melia: "That should suffice. Can you walk?"</p>
<p>"Y-yeah, I think so."</p>
<p>Zeon: "Queen Melia...! <strong>Ung, To what do we owe the honor?</strong>"</p>
<p>"What good is a ruler if they cannot send aid to their people in times of need? I'm sorry to have kept you waiting, Zeon. Please, let me have your report."</p>
<p>It was daytime, and some female soldier A were entering the med camp when she noticed Melia, "Hey... <strong>Hey, look. Isn't that the Queen?</strong>"</p>
<p>The male soldier B beside her was surprised too, "<strong>What? Like the real deal?</strong>"</p>
<p>Zeon, seeing the unneeded attention she'd attracted, agreed, "Right... Back to my post."</p>
<hr />
<p>After he'd dealt with the busybody soldiers, he went back to speak with Melia, "Excuse me. Origin's attack unfortunately caused a landslide near Alfeto Valley entrance. We've been treating the wounded, and also dispatched a survey team to scan the area. The thing is, we've lost contact with the survey team. <em>The line just went dead...</em>"</p>
<p>Kurt added, "There was a really loud sound earlier on! Could be more rocks!"</p>
<p>Melia: "I see. Then we'll take it from here." Then, she turned to "<strong>Eunie, how're you doing over there?</strong>" She was treating the other patients while she had Zeon's report.</p>
<p>"I've healed up the worst of 'em. Now they just need a little R&amp;R."</p>
<p>The soldier she just finished treating, male C, was surprised, "<strong>Aw, really? I've gotta lie down?</strong>"</p>
<p>Then she teased, "C'mon. If you've got the energy to flap yer trap already, you'll be back on your feet in no time."</p>
<p>Melia was delighted at the spirit, "I see I had no cause to worry."</p>
<p>Noah prompted for more information from Zeon, "How many were on the survey team?"</p>
<p>To which he replied, "Three. One was piloting the Levnis." After touching on his Iris, "OK. I've sent the landslide's location to your Iris. You can confirm it for yourself."</p>
<p>"Got it."</p>
<p>Kurt suddenly spoke for a personal request, "Uh, if you happen to see Anita from the survey team... could you..., er... <strong>T-tell her to give back what she owes!</strong> 'Cause I'll be waiting here until she does!"</p>
<p>Melia: "I'll be sure to deliver the message." Then, turning to Eunie and the other injured soldiers, "I'm so sorry to have let this come to pass, everyone. <strong>This ordeal will be over, ere long</strong>."</p>
<p>Soldier A from earlier: "<strong>You watch yourself too, Your Majesty! Don't wanna see you get hurt neither!</strong>"</p>
<p>Soldier B: "<strong>I hope you find our friends!</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>On the muddy road leading toward where the landslide was, the group noticed something on fire. Sena alerted the group, "Hey, look at that!"</p>
<p>Eunie: "A survey branch Levnis?!"</p>
<p>Melia: "Quickly! We must rescue them at once!" They therefore dashed to the point of interest.</p>
<hr />
<p>"<em>Hello...? Who's... A-argh... there...?</em>" Anita lower torso was being sealed under a giant rock.</p>
<p>Melia and the others had already found her, "It's all right. We're here to help. Stay still. I'll get that heavy thing off you right this instant!"</p>
<p>After removing{{footnote: a.k.a. destroying}} the rock, Eunie helped Anita to sit up properly. "Right, that's her injuries about treated."</p>
<p>Melia: "You're a survivor by nature. Good fortune that we made it in time."</p>
<p>"Oh, I can't thank you enough! I thought I was a goner..."{{footnote: Bro, she sounded like Ghondor.}}</p>
<p>Eunie hadn't forgot Kurt's request, "Say, you wouldn't happen to be Anita, by any chance?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, I'm Anita."</p>
<p>Sena passed the news, "Oh, that's great news! There was a guy in the rescue tent who was really worried about you! He said he wanted you to, pay him back, or something?"</p>
<p>Melia: "I suspect that was merely an excuse. He seemed really rather worried. <em>Very insistent that you make it back</em>."</p>
<p>"Ahh, it's... got to be Kurt. We've been in the same unit since first term. He can be a little faint-hearted at times. I'd better go and try to calm him down..."</p>
<p>"Ahh... So you've been joined at the hip since childhood."</p>
<p>"Joined at the... Sorry?" Never heard of that phrase before, eh.{{footnote: Neither do one.}}</p>
<p>"I mean that you were... inseparable. <em>You've had a special connection throughout your lives</em>. You understand each other's feelings, and you lift each other up in times of need, <em>is what I'm trying to say</em>."</p>
<p>Noah sensed something, "<em>Hm?</em>" He probably wondered if she had one friend at the very least like that in her own childhood.</p>
<p>Melia continued, "<strong><em>Your friends are irreplaceable. Be sure to treasure them.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"Y-yes, ma'am! Thank you, <strong>thank you!</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, thinking in his mind: "<em>Did she have someone in mind herself? There's someone out there special to her?{{footnote: Don't ask one, one can't remember. Her sister? Or maybe Shulk?}} But then, she was imprisoned in Origin for so long... So maybe they're already...</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<p>By another site near the waterfall and broken levnis, "Urggg..." Mio discovered a soldier being crushed under the levnis, unable to escape himself.</p>
<p>After examining his situation, she turned around and told the group, "His foot's trapped. We'll need to move the rubble very carefully..."</p>
<p>Melia: "Using Arts would be far too dangerous. In which case..."</p>
<p>Lanz, hearing the chance, turned to Sena, "Someone call for heavy lifters?"</p>
<p>"Awwwww, yeah! We'll clear this out in no time!" And the two got to work.</p>
<p>After removing it, Melia told the soldier, "You're in safe hands now."</p>
<p>"Y-yes, thank you!"</p>
<p>Mio asked for patience, "Hang in there just a little longer. We don't want to overlook anything..."</p>
<hr />
<p>At the final site by some gravel along a slope, Noah found the last soldier lying on the stony surface, assured, "Hold on! It's going to be OK!"</p>
<p>The soldier reported, "There was a... second landslide... Don't mind me... Look for the others..."</p>
<p>Melia: "We're well aware. But firstly..." She drew her staff and swiftly healed him.</p>
<p>"Ah! Feels warm..."</p>
<p>After the soldier got up on his foot, Melia instructed, "Do not move from this spot. We're going to check the immediate area."</p>
<p>He subconsciously did the Kevesi welcoming stance, assumed order received, "A-ah, yes... Of course!"</p>
<hr />
<p>By a dirt slope near the waterfall, the group gathered around for discussion, with Eunie announcing, "Right... I think that's the lot of 'em accounted for!"</p>
<p>Taion: "I wouldn't relax just yet." He turned around and looked up at the jaw-shaped slope, sharing his observation, "The landslide have formed a sharp incline, in turn increasing the risk of loose rocks. <em>I hardly need to state this, but the possibility of further landslides remains high.</em>"</p>
<p>Melia: "Getting caught in another landslide would be undesirable. We must make some distance, and quickly. <strong>Back to Colony 9.</strong>"</p>
<hr />
<p>In Colony 9, the group were met at the medical tent by Zeon and the other soldiers whom had already returned themselves, plus those lying on the bad just now could already stand up, with Soldier B from earlier announced, "<strong>The Queen has returned!</strong>"</p>
<p>Soldier A: "<strong>Hurgggg, Welcome back! We're glad to see you safe, Your Majesty.</strong>"</p>
<p>She got to the topic immediately, "We were at the site of the landslide, but the situation remains precarious. It is vital, that we remove the remaining rocks upon the slope in the coming days. You shall have the Castle's aid, of course... But your own assistance in this matter would also be most appreciated."</p>
<p>"Oh, we'd be glad to help! Never want to have to go through this again..."</p>
<p>Anita: "But, if we hadn't, we'd never have got to meet Queen Melia... I don't regret it. Because I learned today, that we weren't forsaken..."</p>
<p>Melia: "Forsaken?"</p>
<p>Soldier B explained, "The only time we normally ever get to meet Your Majesty is at the Homecoming. <em>We've been through so many bitter times, but we've never known you to help us.</em> Not so directly."</p>
<p>"You make a valid point. From this moment on, I'll endeavor to the best of my ability to allay your fears."</p>
<p>Kurt did the welcoming stance, "Ah... You're too kind, Your Majesty!"</p>
<p>Zeon, seeing the situation right, had something to say, "Then, in the interest of allaying fears, there may be another matter I would like to discuss with you..."</p>
<p>"Oh yes? Speak up, then."</p>
<p>"I would like, from this moment on, to let the colony elect their commander, of their own volition. And I don't mean just for... appointing a successor after death or for the purposes of reform. If they make their voices known, then I think I would gladly relinquish my position as commander this second." Democracy, or meritocracy, eh?</p>
<p>Anita: "<strong>WHAT?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Kurt: "What brought this on...?" They clearly hadn't heard of him discussing with them before then.</p>
<p>Melia tried rephrasing, "Then... you wish to formally step down?"</p>
<p>"Well... I was always the Consul's <em>favorite... plaything</em>. I was a mere pawn, dancing to his whims, enacting his orders... But in coming to terms with our <em>new life</em>, I began to realize, the qualities needed in a commander are... very... different nowadays."</p>
<p>Noah: "Please don't belittle yourself, Zeon. You've worked so hard to get where you are."</p>
<p>"Believe me, I've thought about this long and hard. <strong>About who really fits the role of a commander. It must be someone we all look up to. Someone with whom, we can share our path.</strong>"</p>
<p>"<em>Zeon...</em>"</p>
<p>Melia: "While I do not object to your logic, Zeon, I hope you realize that our role is in the essence naught but a figurehead. What that figurehead represents, however, <strong><em>is something only you can decide.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>"It's down to me...?"</p>
<p>"<strong><em>A person is not shaped solely by their birthright or innate qualities.</em></strong> As long as you remain <strong>critical</strong> of who you are, whether you deserve the position or not has little relevance."</p>
<p>"This... crisis of conscience... <em>You once experienced it as well, Your Majesty?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>Of course.</strong> Everyone has their battles with self doubt. How else does one grow as a person? If you remain true to yourself, then you have <strong>nothing</strong> to fear. In this <strong>rich</strong> tapestry of life, you must find the path that <strong>you</strong> are willing to weave."</p>
<p>"<em>I will give it more thought, then.</em>"</p>
<p>"Very good. I look forward to hearing your answer."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, more thinking in his head, "<em>Melia must have had her share of hardship, to talk about these things in such depth... If she's ever stuck in a rut, I wonder if we'll be able to console her in the same way? Would she even want that?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps feeling his eyes on hers, she turned to him, "Penny for your thoughts, Noah?"</p>
<p>"No, it's nothing. We should get going. We've got some traveling ahead of us." And she agreed.</p>
<hr />
<p>One evening, at the edge of the empty stage (and open ground) in Agnus Castle, the group met "Nia... This is a surprise."</p>
<p>She turned around and replied without a second thought, "Don't worry, I know the whole story... <strong>OH, BLOODY HELL-</strong>" She clearly doesn't expect Melia to be the one speaking, regain her composure as a "behaving" Queen first, before softly and stutteringly spoke, "Ahem. <em>I- see- you are- in- good- company</em>."</p>
<p>"They're kindly serving as my bodyguard. They're assisting me with a number of other matters, too."</p>
<p>Mio clarified, "The assistance goes both ways, actually."</p>
<p>Manana: "We all <strong>one big happy family!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Yes, that's right. <em>Family.</em>"</p>
<p>Nia: "Indubitably. I have a... rough- grasp of our <strong>present</strong> predicament. You've come to hear <strong>their</strong> side of the story, <em>have you not?</em>"</p>
<p>Taion: "You make it sound, as if these are no ordinary <em>Agnians.</em>"</p>
<p>"With Queen Melia's assistance, we have been closely monitoring them on <strong>both</strong> sides. <strong>I'll</strong> get to the point: these people belong... neither to Keves... nor Agnus."</p>
<p>Melia explained to the uninformed group, "To be precise, they were formerly Agnian soldiers, but... Now they claim to have lost their faith even in Agnus. This intense distrust of the future has driven them to wanton destruction." So, she seemed to have been informed without the group's knowledge.</p>
<p>Mio rephrased, "So they stopped believing in anything, and now they just want to ruin things for everyone?"</p>
<p>Sena shook her head in dismay: "<em>That's awful...</em>"</p>
<p>Nia: "The Keves and Agnus of today are founded upon mutual trust and respect. At least, that is the mood we try to foster. But the reality is that not all of us can readily accept these <em>changes</em>."</p>
<p>Melia: "The recent outburst was just an act of passion, but if like-minded people were to <strong>congregate</strong>..."</p>
<p>Taion continued down the logic line, "They may gain enough momentum to pose a legitimate threat, is that it? So they're the ones who have incited the latest uproar, <em>I take it?</em>"</p>
<p>Noah: "We might have to prepare for the worst-case scenario..."</p>
<p>"Manana bite{{footnote: i.e. 'don't understand'.}}. What make worst case so bad?"</p>
<p>Eunie explained to her, "<em>He means, there could be an attack on the Queen's life.</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>MEH-MEH?! That worse than worst case!</strong>"</p>
<p>Melia: "That's one of the reasons, but we simply can't afford to leave this be. I don't believe they truly want to oppose us. Rather, they feel they are at an impasse. <strong><em>One cannot so easily change their way of life, or how they view the world.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Nia assumed, "Perhaps I ought to assert my authority as Queen after all, and-"</p>
<p>Melia rejected her assumption, "No, if you lock horns with them now, it's very possible they will shut you out completely. I would rather have you prepare to welcome them in with open arms."</p>
<p>"<em>That's incredibly kind of you...</em>"</p>
<p>Eunie: "So? Where do we find these troublemakers?"</p>
<p>"It seems, they're lying low at Hovering Reef 6."</p>
<p>"<strong>Seriously? That's right next to the Castle!{{footnote: Keves Castle.}}</strong>"</p>
<p>Taion: "Presumably they approached under the guise of their fellow Agnian soldiers. The Castle isn't on particularly high alert, so it makes sense that they wouldn't arouse too much suspicion."</p>
<p>Nia: "Yes, <em>as sad as it is...</em> I- hear they're pooling their forces. You'd best be on your guard."</p>
<p>Melia: "Fear not. I am no stranger to battle. <strong>And besides</strong>, look at my entourage."</p>
<p>"You shouldn't have to get used to this. <strong><em>Experience can make a person stronger, it's true, but it can't take away one's pain.</em></strong> <em>That goes for Queens, too, you know.</em>" Lots of story for each of them too, huh!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mio, in her thought, "<em>The mood's turned dark all of a sudden...</em>"{{footnote: Translator suggested the mood being reflective and reminiscing, particularly of their past, rather than the weak adjective 'dark'.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"I'm aware of that. Thank you, Nia."</p>
<p>"<em>Take care, you guys...</em>"</p>
<hr />
<p>One night, a cruising Agnian levnis guarding one of the lower island of the  Hovering Reef. Hiding behind a rock, the group's arrival went unnoticed. Sena noted, "Agnian Auto-Levs..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "They've hauled those things out here? Can't catch a break, can we?"</p>
<p>Melia: "As Lady Nia informed us, we should expect them to be hiding in an ambush somewhere on this island. I must remind you that we are only here to negotiate. If possible, I would like to avoid combat..."</p>
<p>Lanz voiced his concerns, "Sure, but what if they're the ones to come at us first?"</p>
<p>"Then suppress them at once. We could even disable their Levnises, so that they have nothing with which to fight back."</p>
<p>"Hey, I've been meaning to ask for a while now... You really know how to handle yourself in a scrap, don't you?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm no stranger to the field of battle. Nor is this the first attempt on my life."</p>
<p>Sena was surprised, "Whuh? Even though you're the Queen?"</p>
<p>"Precisely <strong>because</strong> I am the Queen. <em>Is it really so strange for nobles to be acquainted with violence?</em> There was even an assassin within my family once."</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH?!</strong> I'm sorry, I hope we didn't bring back painful memories for you..."</p>
<p>"Please, it's perfectly fine. Many are the things that have shaped me into who I am today. <strong><em>Learning to accept my weaknesses, understanding each other's differences... Opening one's heart to others...</em></strong>"</p>
<p>Lanz did a whistle at Melia, "Whiu... You must've been in some real good company to learn all that."</p>
<p>"Ahaha! Perhaps, yes. Back when I was young and naïve, my companions taught me some invaluable lessons."</p>
<p>Mio: "And you took those lessons to heart. That's how you came to be such a magnificent Queen."</p>
<p>"Though times may change, their teachings will never fade. <em>Which is why I still believe...</em> I believe that our last breaths should not be those of despair..."</p>
<hr />
<p>The group approached the center of the island, with Sena calling out softly, "Hello? Nobody at home?"</p>
<p>As she finished her sentence, they were immediately surrounded by Agnian soldiers, blocking both entrances along the valley. One Annihilationist Soldier shouted, "<strong>DON'T! MOVE!</strong>" while the group withdrew their blades.</p>
<p>Mio: "Melia..."</p>
<p>"I'll handle this... <strong>My name is Melia Antiqua. I wish only to speak with you.</strong>"</p>
<p>The Annihilationist Leader replied with sniping tone and poisonous tongue, "Speak with us? Rip us to shreds, more like, Queen of Keves."</p>
<p>"You are the ringleader, are you? <strong>State your name.</strong>"</p>
<p>"And why should I tell you?" This was a slightly buffed guy with a slide-like huge eyebrow, pointed chin, and wear a 'head armor' that looked more like one wore by nurses. "The world I once knew is gone! They told us, defeating Keves was the only way for us to be saved! It was the right thing to do. The <em>just</em>... thing to do! And I believed it!"</p>
<p>Melia just shook her head and sighed.</p>
<p>"Do you realize, how many of my friends <strong>died</strong> in <strong>pursuit</strong> of that <strong>dream</strong>? You think I can just tell them, 'Yeah, <strong>sorry guys, you died for nothing'?!</strong>"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Mio, noticing the enraging tone, thinking in her mind, "<em>He's lost his cool. Maybe we should step in and deal with him... But... Melia told us she'd handle this.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, the leader continued, "You <strong>ruined</strong> it. You joined forces with the Agnian Queen, <strong>and you drilled these... NOTIONS... into our heads!</strong> You take away our friends, then sully our reason to <strong>live</strong>... My friends, died, that day... but you've killed them <strong>ALL</strong> over again!"</p>
<p>Mio can't resist interfering, "<strong>And that's why you've decided to destroy</strong> everything?"</p>
<p>"That's right. We don't need a shitty world like this anyway."</p>
<p>Melia kept her calm, "Is that all?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I told you to stay where you are!</strong>" But she sheathed her blades and walked forward.</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>Melia?!</strong>"</p>
<p>The leader was immediately alerted, "<strong>HEY! WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PULL?</strong>"</p>
<p>"I could ask you the same thing." The calmness in her voice was unwavering, despite the heated situation. "<em>Why do you hesitate?</em> You could attack me right now."</p>
<p>"Pf-pf-pf-s-s-<strong>SHUT UP!</strong>"</p>
<p>"You have no desire to destroy anything. You are simply trying to get by in a world where nothing makes sense any more. <em>And that's why I'm here.</em>"</p>
<p>"Shut up, <strong>shut up, SHUT UP!!!</strong>" No, that's not true, I'm unwavering, I must be unwavering, I will be unwavering! He therefore called his spear blade to prepare to fight, unwilling to listen to the encouraging statement in case he changed his mind about it.</p>
<hr />
<p>After a bashing and all lay down on the ground, with only the leader still standing, he was still angry, despairing, "<strong>Fire and ash!</strong> So that's how it is? <strong>That's how you look down at us?</strong>"</p>
<p>Melia don't understand, "Sorry?"</p>
<p>"<strong>I know all about you.</strong> You Queens live longer than any of us could ever dream. You aren't like us, are you?! <strong>That's how you can just SIT on your thrones, TOYING WITH OUR LIVES LIKE-</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio couldn't hear his false statement, rebutting before he finished his sentence, "She <em>is</em> like us! <strong>If you hurt her, she feels pain...</strong> She bleeds all the same..."</p>
<p>"Mio..." Shaking her head, Melia tried to discourage her from speaking more, but Mio was insistent,</p>
<p>"That's why she's came all this way, to hear your story! She wants to know more about you... She wants to share her time, with <em>you</em>!"</p>
<p>"Wh-h-h-huh... <strong>Yeah, right. OUR LIVES are like the BLINK of an EYE to her ilk!</strong>"</p>
<p>"Just because she lives longer, it doesn't mean she's any different from you! <strong>We're all here, aren't we?</strong> We're all alive..."</p>
<p>"...That's enough, Mio. I see now how you feel about all this."</p>
<p>Lanz cannot hold back his thoughts, "Mate, have you been making that speech to the Kevesi officers too? Telling everyone that Melia's different to everyone else?"</p>
<p>"<em>You bet I did.</em> <strong>She's</strong> so far up herself it makes me <strong>sick</strong>."</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "If anyone's warped... distorted <em>here... it's you</em>."</p>
<p>"<strong>Then what am I supposed to do? WHO ELSE, AM I SUPPOSED TO TAKE MY RAGE OUT ON?!!! Tell me the truth.</strong> Right now. <strong>The pure, UNADULTERATED truth!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Melia shook her head, "<em>That, I cannot tell you. <strong>The answer lies in you, and you alone</strong>. You must have realized by now.</em> <strong><em>There is no weight to the 'truth' of another, if you cannot judge it for yourself.</em></strong>"</p>
<p>And he just gasped facing reality.</p>
<p>"If you must have an object of hatred in order to live your life, then let it be me. But promise me, that someday, you'll live for the things that truly have worth. Just as you and your comrades-in-arms <em>once did</em>..." Her eyes stern.</p>
<p>"It's already too late... I can't go back. Not after what I've done..."</p>
<p>"<em>I highly doubt that.</em> You are still breathing, are you not?"</p>
<p>Noah asked Melia, "Are you all right?"</p>
<p>"I told you, I am no stranger to battle. Besides, I could not tolerate simply watching from the sidelines..."</p>
<p>"<em>Melia...</em>"</p>
<p>"Their sadness, frustration, anger... I shall never forget these feelings. <strong>Come! Let us</strong> proceed to the next location." And that's the end we heard of the leader and his group.</p>
<hr />
<p>Back inside the Castle throne room{{footnote: i.e. the room with the pods.}}, "Your Majesty!" Aizel immediately dashed as he saw her, did the Kevesi welcoming stance, and announced, "You've returned!"</p>
<p>"I trust it's been... <strong>quiet</strong> in my absence?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Then turned to him, "I see that you have calmed down."</p>
<p>"Yes, I have realized. However <strong>fervent</strong> my loyalty, <strong>if</strong> <em>I am ever the source of Her Highness's anguish</em>, it does no good."</p>
<p>"You think too deeply, Aizel. 'Tis your mind's fiction."</p>
<p>"Tah! <em>I will rectify that!</em>"</p>
<p>Smilingly, "Mmm hmm hmm... I am sure you will."</p>
<p>Then, the Queen's guard approached, asking "How was your trip? And what of the world?"</p>
<p>"Mankind's follies... <strong><em>People never learn. Whatever the passage of fate may bring, we must never lose the spirit of defiance.</em></strong> Lest we submit to injustice. As we once did..."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Noah, now voicing out softly his thought, "<em>Again... Why does she look so sad...?</em>"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As she walked towards her throne, she continued speaking, "My friends and I, we... We fought hard for all this. We staked our lives on this future. And if there's a chance to keep it that way... I too will be happy... <em>to sacrifice myself for this world</em>."</p>
<p>"Snuff that for a laugh." Melia turned around and saw Eunie walked up to her, where she continued speaking, "I hate that. You're the important one here."</p>
<p>"Pardon?"</p>
<p>And the group walked forward and joined, with Noah agreeing with Eunie, "<em>It's true. It's something I noticed before.</em> As befits a Queen, you're always thinking about your subjects. <em>But who thinks about what's best for you?</em>"</p>
<p>Mio added, "Seeing you suffer alone like this... None of us like it. It's too sad to think about. Losing you, that is. You're one of us."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<strong>Yeah, think about</strong> how much you always think of us. It's only fair... if you let us do the same <em>for you.</em>" And Lanz and Sena nodded. Even Riku and Manana.</p>
<p>"I am speechless..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Melia, you <em>are</em> needed in this world. But, <em>you weren't born solely for the world's sake.</em>"</p>
<p>"That may be so... However, I..." And she looked down on her feet as she reminisced her sad memories, or maybe, trying to find a way to rebut.</p>
<p>Noah walked closer to face her, attracting her attention, "If you'd permit me, I'll gladly lend you my strength. Not because you are our Queen... But because we're travelers, in the here and now. So we should live. Together."</p>
<p>And she looked at him attentively while her mind wandered into the past,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A blonde short hair man with large eyes{{footnote: Shulk}}, "I'm glad you're with us, Melia!"</p>
<p>And her mind wandered past a buff guy with brown skin{{footnote: Reyn}}, a slightly-brown skinned black hair brown iris woman with a mole on her chin{{footnote: Sharla}}, a orange-brown Nopon{{footnote: Riki, maybe Riku's ancestor?}}, A black hair brown skin guy with beard{{footnote: Dunban}},</p>
<p>A green nopon with an unriped flower on top of his/her head, holding a staff forward, spoke, "Fighting alongside you all  is the best!", another pink Nopon{{footnote: These two nopons are in Future Connected, but unfortunately, one didn't play that sequel, only watched the first 20 minutes or so of gameplay from YouTube, so one don't remember the names and didn't search it up.}}, and finally, a blonde hair girl with huge green iris, pale skin, always smiling{{footnote: Fiora.}}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And her sadness turned into a smile as the happy memories never fades. "Yes... You are right. How funny..." She closed her eyes to remember more happy moments she had with her friends. "<strong><em>Though wisdom is said to come with age... still you all seem to teach me so much...</em></strong> If some things elude my grasp... your words... show me that <em>there is more. More to life...</em> They guide me when I run astray. Again... <em>and again...</em> How fortunate I am... to have you."</p>
<p>And she walked past Noah to the middle, be surrounded by the group. And Eunie can tease, "Ehuhuh! Now that's more like it, girl." And everyone just feel more relax; with Riku looked up at her, relieved that she'd opened up.</p>
<p>Noah approached to her side from behind, "Melia... Thank you. Thank you... for always having believed in us."</p>
<p>"That's one thing I would never doubt. Now, we embark on our quests. To create... the future."</p>
<p>"Yes... It's ours!"</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After this encounter, we can now access Melia's bedroom from the "proper" way.{{footnote: The improper way is to go to the garden on the top and jump down, via a few protruding area, and finally drop on the balcony.}}</p>

<p>One evening, the group arrived at the Cloudkeep{{footnote: The woman at the back, you should've known after starting of Chapter 7, is Melia.}} in search of Nia, but she was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Eunie: "Huh? Where's the Queen...?"</p>
<p>Mio have no idea, "Maybe she isn't there... But... where is she then?"</p>
<p>Just then, they heard someone humming some peaceful tune from another direction. Lanz: "Huh?" Here she came, Nia in her adventurous{{footnote: A.K.A. the costume in Xenoblade 2}} costume, entering the scene,</p>
<p>"Ahh... Haven't worn this for a while. Still looks pretty natty, though, eh, Nia old fox? It's so tough to get around in those <strong>bloody</strong> formal duds. <strong>One false step, and you fall... flat on your face</strong>... Ahhh, I fiiinally feel like I can be myself. Really cut loose! I love it! <strong>OH!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Noah echoed back: "Oh..." There was an awkward silence encircling the atmosphere before Nia nervously and surprisingly made small jog towards the group.</p>
<p>"Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-what are you guys doing here...?"</p>
<p>Scratching his head, he was too befuddled to reply, "W-we just... Uh... What are you...?"</p>
<p>Mio took over, "Erm... Majesty... your... clothes..."</p>
<p>That reminded her, "<strong>W-wait!</strong> Just hang on! Give me a second here, all right?" She turned around to calm herself down, "Whoo.... Ahem." Then, she turned around and present herself with her former Queen's 'manners': "Well met, all of you. Please accept my heartfelt welcome. I can offer you only a simple welcome today, but do please make yourself comfortable."</p>
<p>Noah observed her difference for a while, "Hmm..."</p>
<p>"Is something the matter?"</p>
<p>"...Doesn't it wear on you, <em>acting like that?</em>"</p>
<p>"Wh-what?" Now that's Nia.</p>
<p>Mio: "Ah... Noah!"</p>
<p>Nia: "<strong>No. It's... perfectly fine.</strong> <em>Dispense with such concerns!</em> Pray, let not my regal status prohibit you from presenting your enquiries. Please, speak your minds."</p>
<p>Eunie bravely go forward at her permission, "All right, well, here's a question... What's that get-up all about?"</p>
<p>"Ah... ah, yes. Perhaps you would find my clothes rather... <strong>curious</strong>."</p>
<p>"I mean... if you don't want to talk about it, that's cool, no sweat."</p>
<p>"Oh! N-no, it's nothing like that... Before, I told you how the world was once divided into two, <em>if you recall</em>?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you told us when we first met. How could we forget that, your Majesty?{{footnote: Hah, one always forget things on first met, unless someone make it memorable.}}"</p>
<p>"These clothes belong to that era. When the worlds were two, unmingled. These raiments were created specially for me in that older realm."</p>
<p>Mio: "So... So they're from your old world, Majesty?"</p>
<p>"Right. I suppose you could call it a keepsake of my motherland, if you like."</p>
<p>Taion caught the word, "'Motherland'...? Can you explain that word, please?"</p>
<p>"The place of my coming into existence in the world, of my infancy and upbringing... We call that our 'motherland'."</p>
<p>Noah: "Your Majesty's motherland... What kind of place could it have been?"</p>
<p>"Are you interested, Noah?"</p>
<p>"I am... The subject seems so huge, I can scarcely begin to imagine it. If it please you, I'd love to hear more about your world, Your Majesty."</p>
<p>"Certainly, I'd be happy to. Well, to begin with, I ought to explain..." She then crossed her arms together, and her eyes pinched together as if she had a playful joke to play on them. "...Actually, now that I think it over... if I were to tell you the whole of the story, a full day and night might not suffice, I fear. In fact, I'm certain of it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see! Then I'm sorry to have made such an unreasonable demand of you. Well, maybe another time then...?"</p>
<p>Acting pitifully, "Even then... Surely you have important matters you ought to be taking care of. It won't do for me to detain you here."</p>
<p>"Huh? Well, I suppose so, but..."</p>
<p>Smilingly, "Therefore, let us go forth together!" Yeah, the adventurous Nia had came back online!</p>
<p>Instantaneously reacting, "Yes, Your Majesty. As you wi-... Wait."</p>
<p>Taion: "Ah, forgive me, Your Majesty. I don't think we quite heard right."</p>
<p>"I mean to say, that I will accompany you on your{{footnote: Original video have typo, should be 'your' not 'you'.}} travels. That way, I'll be able to continue my tales. Night and day, every day, if needs be! Ah... I mean... that is not <strong>NOT</strong> to imply that being cooped up here the whole time is as lonesome as it is tedious... or that I'm well pleased with myself for inventing an elegant, way-sneaky excuse to get out...{{footnote: AHAHAHAHA. Well, you just told us your mind in inverse form, Nia!!!}} It's nothing like that at all... Please, do not misinterpret it thus."</p>
<p>Lanz: "No one was saying that anyway..." Ahem ahem...</p>
<p>"Uhm... I suppose it <em>may be a bit much, eh</em>...?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Uh, we weren't saying that, either..."</p>
<p>"All right then, it's decided! A 'deal', shall we say?" The smile on her face cannot anymore conceal.</p>
<p>"Y-yes, Your Majesty..."</p>
<p>Turning around, "... AWWWWW YISSSS!!!" Turning back to face them...</p>
<p>Noah: "OK, then... uhm... We humbly beg your grace, Your Majesty... O-o-or was that 'respectfully'...?"</p>
<p>"Oh, come now! No need for such formality. I ask only for your kind support, Noah. <em>Oh</em>... And from now on, I'd like you to address me simply as 'Nia'. From now on, <strong>I'll be just another one of your</strong> ordinary fellow traveling-folk!"</p>
<hr />
<p>At the Agnus Castle ground, the group, together with Nia, approached Ghondor one night, whom started whining, "<strong>Augh, what do you plonkers want now?</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Hey, c'mon. Don't be like that. We're just here to say hi!"</p>
<p>"Uh? What's that? You got time on your hands, have you? ...Huh?" She just noticed the new fella in the group. "Why, if it isn't..."</p>
<p>Nia: "I believe this is the first time we speak directly, isn't it, Ghondor?"</p>
<p>"Can someone tell me what the hell's going on? What's the Queen of Agnus doin' here?... Oh, uh, <em>hang on</em>. I suppose we <em>are</em> in Agnus Castle right now, so uhum... maybe it's not so weird to see you here... But, what I don't get is, why's the Queen of Agnus seem to know about me?"</p>
<p>"That's... Well, it's a long story. The Vandham name, and those that bear it, have a deep meaning for me."</p>
<p>"You mean my family?"</p>
<p>"In the past, I... we... were saved, by a man called Vandham. He taught us a lot about life, and what it was we were called to do. It's not exaggeration to say that, without him, there would be no me."</p>
<p>Lanz was surprised, "Huh? A real deep connection between Nia and Ghondor's fam? <em>Spooky</em>."</p>
<p>"The memories of it are all but lost now... <em>These were events of the distant past.</em>"</p>
<p>Ghondor: "<em>O-ho...</em> Uhhh, more to the point, seems you dags have gotten pretty used to chumming up with royalty. <em>Like it's no big thing</em>!"</p>
<p>Sena: "Well, Nia asked us to treat her that way. Like another one of the gang."</p>
<p>Lanz: "C'mon, Ghondor. Surely you more than anyone wouldn't expect us to mince our words around Nia."</p>
<p>"Wind your neck in, will ya? Nothin' wrong with how I talk!"</p>
<p>Nia: "Heheh... Oh, you're so bold and unabashed. I simply adore it!"</p>
<p>"Uh... oh...? I... suppose I am..." That was blushing!</p>
<p>"I mean, you've passed through the conflict with the false Queen, maintained order in the Castle... There are a lot of things that came about because of your blood, sweat, and tears, Ghondor."</p>
<p>"Huh? Well, that's <em>a real heckuva compliment</em>... Too much for the likes of me maybe, your Madge. All I reckon we really did was, <strong>set a few boundaries</strong> to stop things going daft. I don't have a clue about your Agnian folks though."</p>
<p>"You're just being humble, Ghondor. Please, there's no need for it. <em>It's not easy to earn people's trust</em>, to maintain the balance. And you do all that, while still remaining natural, unadulterated Ghondor."</p>
<p>"<strong>OIII, I'm basically an adult!</strong> I'm almost -- <em>Ah, forget it</em>..." Bro how old are you even?</p>
<p>Sena: "<em>Ghondor... You really soften up when you get a few kind words, don't you?</em>"</p>
<p>"<strong>HUH...!!! WHO'RE YOU CALLIN' SOFT...?!</strong>"</p>
<p>Nia changed the subject, "I hope Agnus <em>can count on your continued support</em>."</p>
<p>"I mean, what I'd really like to be saying right now... is 'bite me'. <em>But</em>... since I' got a real-deal Queen going to <strong>all the trouble</strong> of asking me, <em>I guess I've gotta at least consider the request a bit</em>."{{footnote: OK, she's just don't like that. She wants adventure, not on the throne.}}</p>
<p>"From the bottom of my heart, thank you, Ghondor. As the nominal lady of Agnus Castle, I bestow upon you my sincere admiration for fulfilling the-"</p>
<p>"<strong>HEY! WHOA! ENOUGH ALREADY...! It's like you <em>wanna</em> make me squirm?!!!</strong>"</p>
<p>Sena: "Ah, there's our Ghondor..."</p>
<p>"<strong>Just shut up, will you?! We're done talking about me, all right?! You Ouroboros arseholes, mind your own beeswax, all right?</strong> <em>I better no hear you've been holding the Queen back! You're a real goofy bunch, arentcha?</em> <strong>Just bein' around ya counts as a hazard!</strong>"</p>
<p>Eunie wasn't happy hearing that, "Pffff... Pot calling the kettle black much, there, Ghondor, love?"</p>
<hr />
<p>Inside the City's memorial hall, Nia herself was looking at the Ouroboros Stone, reminiscing about the past perhaps, when Mio walked in, "Your Majesty! There you are."</p>
<p>She turned to face her, "Please, it's 'Nia'! You aren't used to it yet, are you?"</p>
<p>"Uh... I'm sorry, your... Please, forgive me... It's{{footnote: Another typo error here.}} just..."</p>
<p>"Eheh, it's fine. I may have taken my teasing <em>a step too far there</em>."</p>
<p>"Uhum... I hope what I'm about to say doesn't come out the wrong way, but..."</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"It's just, <strong>you're our Queen! We believed you were</strong> the one that gave us all life... And that we'd return to you in the end. You were like this awesome being high above... None of us could even dream of talking to you."</p>
<p>"Ngh..."</p>
<p>"And now you're just traveling along with us and chatting like it's an everyday thing. It's just really bizarre to me somehow. Like things have been switched around. It still feels a little strange..."</p>
<p>"Could it be... that it just hasn't sunk in yet?"</p>
<p>"Ngpfff..."</p>
<p>"... <em>I see</em>... Heheh... Well, it's the same for me."</p>
<p>Surprised, "Wh-what?"</p>
<p>"I'm sure I've told you this before, but please indulge me. While I was asleep in the Cloudkeep, I was getting information about what was happening in the world.{{footnote: Presumably, only specific information, or our brain would explode by information overload.}} So I knew, long before, that you were not M, but an independent being called 'Mio'. But... <em>it was nothing more than information. I wanted to truly know you, <strong>more than</strong> anyone else, but I couldn't touch you, couldn't make contact. I felt so close to you... But you were still this <strong>distant</strong> far-off thing... It was so frustrating</em>."</p>
<p>"Uhrrrr..."</p>
<p>"<em>But right now, you're so close I can reach out and touch you... Speak with you, even.</em> I never thought the day would come. <em>It's a <strong>truly</strong> strange feeling</em>."</p>
<p>"I-It's the same for me..."</p>
<p>"<em>Indeed.</em> It's amazing really, the way things worked out, don't you think?"</p>
<p>"Uhuh... For sure. If I hadn't become Ouroboros, I'd never have had the chance to meet you, Nia. Sometimes, <strong><em>a small pebble starts the avalanche which changes your whole future</em></strong>, <em>don't you think</em>?"</p>
<p>"...N-no, I don't think you can put it all down to chance."</p>
<p>"...Uh-huh? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"I think we met because we were supposed to, Mio. It was meant to be. <em>Because, to me, you're...</em>"</p>
<p>She didn't managed to finish her sentence when Eunie interrupted from the entrance, "<strong>Hey! Mio! Nia!</strong>" The group were waiting outside for them. "<strong>We're heading out soon, guys! Get a move on, or you'll get left behind!</strong>"</p>
<p>Mio: "<strong>OK! We're coming!</strong>" Then, turning to Nia, "Shall we go join the others?"</p>
<p>That cut the previous conversation short. She rapidly answered, "Sure. Let's do that." She held her arms by her chest as if to hold something dear close to her heart. Mio, whom had already turned and leaving, turned back when she called out, "Mio!"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"I'm really glad we got to <em>talk like this</em>."</p>
<p>"Yeah, me too... Nia."</p>
<hr />
<p>One morning. By the forest where you could see the dilapidated modern buildings, the group were standing by a ledge overlooking the giant trees and all that, enjoying the sounds of waterfall in the distance, the ever falling leaves from the Yggdrasil-size tree, and the clouds that shrouded the height forever. The brought Nia back in memories, "Ohhhhhhh...."</p>
<p>Noah prompted, "Nia...? Everything all right?"</p>
<p>She turned around and explained, "This place you call Maktha Wildwood... Do you know anything about all the ruins and things scattered around here?"</p>
<p>Shaking his head, "No, to tell the truth."</p>
<p>Eunie: "I never paid them any mind, I guess. But now you mention 'em, they do seem pretty weird."</p>
<p>Sena: "...<em>Oh! Hey</em>, is this also related to stuff from your old world, Nia?"</p>
<p>"<strong>That's a good guess, Sena Not quite right</strong>, but you aren't far off."</p>
<p>Taion: "Please, explain."</p>
<p>She thought about it for a moment, gathered her storyline, before continuing, "All right, I will. This is... <em>probably</em> something you ought to know about." Turning around to look at the ruins, "I told you before about Aionios's creation, right? Well, what I'm about to talk about goes back much further into the past than that."</p>
<p>Mio: "You mean... when the worlds were one?"</p>
<p>"The people of that time had access to absolute power, using it to create and enjoy a flourishing civilization. But, in the end, they started to fight each other for control over that very power... And because of that, the power became a calamity and ripped the world in two." She turned back to face them, "What we're looking at now, is the remnants of the destruction that humanity has wrought... So the true meaning of all this ruin... is to stand as a monument to the history that created this world."</p>
<p>Taion philosophically added, "If you really think about it, we human beings are the cause of all of it..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "<em>I don't get it... Why fight till everything burns?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>The answer is... because they were afraid</em>."</p>
<p>Sena: "Afraid... of what?"</p>
<p>"Afraid of 'ending'..."</p>
<p>Mio: "Hrrr...."</p>
<p>"All life... All civilizations and cultures... Everything comes to an end, in time. Of course, humans are part of the world, too. We can't escape that rule either. But people never stop looking for a way, <strong>even if it means going beyond the rules</strong>. <em>'Eternity'... That's what they were searching for</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>Eternity...</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>If the present moment carries on forever, then the end will never come. That's eternity</em>. With that, the miserable decay that you're looking at now would never come to pass."</p>
<p>Noah: "Hngh..."</p>
<p>"I think you probably all know the rest of the story already. Why this world that we're in now is called 'Aionios'... the realm of eternity."</p>
<p>Mio: "Z also wanted eternity... Just as the people did back then."</p>
<p>Noah: "But... I mean... Even though they were longing for eternity... to sacrifice so many lives to achieve it, it's not... It can't be right!"</p>
<p>"I agree. We might get hurt... and someday, we'll be gone. But <strong><em>we have to keep moving forward, in spite of all that.</em></strong> That's what it means to live. Right, Nia?"</p>
<p>Her eyebrow raised, "...Yes. Exactly right. That must be clear to you all now. You should hold on to that vision of life, cherish it as you go forward." Taking one last look at the ruins, "Keep that in your heart so that you never repeat the mistakes of the past."</p>
<hr />
<p>One evening, when the red sky enhances the redness of the Saffronia's leaves, "Ahh... The scent of Saffronia... This takes me back..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Takes you back...? You mean, you know what this is?"</p>
<p>"Yes, of course! Saffronia trees used to grow in the world that I came from, you see."</p>
<p>Sena: "Huh? For real?"</p>
<p>Mio: "So <em>that's</em> where Saffronia trees come from... <strong>Who'd have guessed?</strong>"</p>
<p>"That's not all... What you call the Urayan Mountains came from my world, too..."</p>
<p>Eunie: "Whoa... Seriously? I always thought they were funny-shaped mountains..."</p>
<p>Looking away, "I mean, now they're mountains... Back then, they weren't so picturesque."</p>
<p>Sena was curious, "Are there more places like this? Stuff that we don't know the true origin of...?"</p>
<p>"Actually, yes! In fact, I daresay, pretty much everywhere you've seen till now!"</p>
<p>Lanz: "Makes sense. If you hadn't been here, we'd have just walked right past like it was no big thing!" Yeah, speak of taking things for granted...</p>
<p>"I suppose it's good for you to know about how things were in the old world. Well now you've all got this new perspective, why not have a look back at the path you've already traced?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Looking back at where we came from... That could be a really valuable experience."</p>
<p>"Yes! Please, give it some thought. The path that you're on now will lead you to <em>the future that you've dreamed of</em>.{{footnote: Or, one daresay, never dreamt of. Not even one that one could imagine.}}"</p>
<hr />
<p>Such many places they've visited. It's time to take a rest at Valdi's colony! Plus, it's another night. Sitting by the tables, Eunie asked, "OK... So what we got next?"</p>
<p>Noah: "Good question! Nia! Anywhere you still want to go?"</p>
<p>"Mmm... Well, if you're asking me to choose, then I may have to ask your advice first."</p>
<p>Mio: "Sure. I hope we can give you a decent answer!"</p>
<p>"In all the places you guys have been so far... was there ever a place where you could... look at the sky up close? Almost touch it..."</p>
<p>Taion immediately rebutted, "But... What do you mean, close to the sky...?"{{footnote: OK, it's not exactly rebutting, but the word 'but' means a lot. If you use 'and' it would mean another meaning.}}</p>
<p>Eunie: "Uh, I guess she means, like, have we ever been to the highest place in the world, right?"</p>
<p>That kept Sena thinking, "The highest place...? Uhm... Have we? Maybe? Maybe not..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Is that where you'd like to go now, Nia?"</p>
<p>"Yes... I mean... I don't have any really major reason for it, but... Just... when you asked where I wanted to go, that was the first thing that popped into my head."</p>
<p>Mio: "What, the sky, you mean?"</p>
<p>"Maybe, when I look up at the sky, I just... long to go back there. A sort of nostalgia.{{footnote: Yeah, Elysium.}}"</p>
<p>"Hmmm..."</p>
<p>Noah: "Well, if that's what you want, then why don't we try and find a high place for you?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Really? You're good with that?"</p>
<p>Eunie: "I'm cool with it. Anyway, it was me who brought up this whole 'where do you want to go' chat in the first place."</p>
<p>Sena was excited, "If there's a way-up-there, sky-scraping place like that, I'd love to check it out myself!"</p>
<p>"You guys... Thank you so much. I guess I'm counting on you all over again. Let's find it together then! The place where we'll be close enough to touch the sky!"</p>

<p><strong>Translator's note on environment:</strong> The frosty snow covered the hilt of the sword; snow eagles and some huge-wingspan-birds roamed the sky at this height. The blizzard never stops, and the wind continually guzzled. This, is <strong>The Cavity</strong>, the remnants after Shania annihilated where the City originally was.</p>

<p>Standing atop one morning, Nia could view the Agnus Castle floating on the far distance. The Castle ground aren't even as tall as the current location, though its 'tip'{{footnote: The jaws of the castle that pointed upward like beams, but aren't hollow within, probably.}} lurks to approximately the same height, probably higher?</p>
<p>"Ahh! Such a blue sky... Though the world changes, no matter what form it may take, the sky up there... it stays the same." Blue and cloudy.</p>
<p>Mio: "Ungh..."</p>
<p>Nia turned to the group, appreciating, "Thank you... I'm grateful to all of you. It's kind of you to indulge me like this."</p>
<p>Noah: "No. It's fine. Don't forget... Asking you along was our idea."</p>
<p>"I'm pleased you all became Ouroboros. I'm glad that you did."</p>
<p>Sena: "N-Nia, what's gotten into you? Why are you saying this now?" As she was speaking, Nia was closing her eyes, perhaps to reminisce, perhaps to appreciate the feelings of gratefulness? After she opened back her eyes, she explained,</p>
<p>"When this battle is over, the stationary worlds will move once again. When the worlds were divided, they knew nothing of each other.{{footnote: A.K.A. all memories will be wiped out.}} In the end, they'll be strangers once again... Perfectly ignorant, as will we."</p>
<p>"Huh..." Mio was startled.</p>
<p>"Even so... I wanted... to make a memory. The day when we part for good... It's coming. But still... I wanted us to share this moment. I wanted to feel that special connection, those ties that bind us together. Not just as your Queen; but also as your friend."</p>
<p>In her appreciation stance, she felt it in her heart, "Nia..."</p>
<p>"So just... thank you." Looking at Mio as she spoke, especially for her. "In the end, it's up to you. My hope, is invested in your future. You must defeat Z, and make a better world, with your own hands!"</p>
<p>Shaking her head, she opposed, "Hey... That's not quite right."</p>
<p>That took her by surprise, "Huh?"</p>
<p>"That better world... You'll be building it together with us, Nia."</p>
<p>"Y-you mean...?"</p>
<p>"I mean, even if we do get separated, someday, we'll see each other again. We want you with us, Nia, in that future. How could we not? We need you. Rather... please stay." And she walked forward and took Nia's right hand, hamburgered it in her own palms. "Because... The connection we share... Nia... That's something... that can never be broken."</p>
<p>"Mio..." She turned to look at the other Ouroboros (and Nopons); they weren't shaking their heads or anything. "Ah... <em>I mean, if that's... the future that you want...</em> <strong>N-No...</strong> Let me try that again." Putting her other hand on Mio's top ones, "That future, I'll share it with you! It's not just yours... It's <em>our</em> future we'll invest in. For that, we need this world to end. Until that time..."</p>
<p>Mio understood, "Yeah... We'll be by your side until then... Nia."</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="postscript"><a class="header" href="#postscript">Postscript</a></h1>
<p>Night after night, one walk with the protagonists of the story. In days one don't feel like it, one'll just do several minutes, usually pushing through (relatively) non-eventful part of the story. When the event is heartbreaking, emotional, it'll take a longer time for one to be immersed with them. And if one is emotional, one'll take a longer time to be with them too; perhaps because one's a coward that needs some cushion to face the calamities in one's own life. And having a fantasy character when no one else wants to be by one's side is what one can gathers.</p>
<p>From time to time, one want to postpone the story from finishing. So one took some diversions and wrote the "More About" section. It's not complete, for some other stories are either not related to the main story, or one just don't like the story (like Triton's, the story one don't like the most). But a story has to end. A story that has a beginning must come to an end. And one end it on the last day of 2024. What must one say, <em>emptiness</em>? Perhaps, but one could always start translating another story again, which perhaps one'll do it soon enough, another Xenoblade, and that's another story.</p>
<p>One was especially grateful for the emotional road it took me on, through one's ups and downs. One can't tough it up, but one can cry alongside them.</p>
<p>As one said, the story was not easy to write. From <em>How to Know a Person</em> by David Brooks, he mentioned; the good novelists don't start with a character and build a story around it; nor do they start with an idea for a plot, then create characters who operate in that story. Instead, they <strong>start with a relationship.</strong> The alikeness and difference between them, arise some tension in between, and cause relationship to grow, falter, or flourish; and in the process, change each other. This story grows around the relationship between each character in the protagonist -- the relationship between Noah and Mio are especially vibrant, for, in their words, they're off-seers that touch the lives of many others, and in turn, many others touch them. Nevertheless, we cannot deny the interaction of other protagonists with each other: the occasional brain-daft of Lanz teasing Eunie; that Eunie now had a guy to think for her so she can choose not to think herself; that Noah can push some analysis to Taion rather than do all by himself, having someone to discuss with analytically; and the interactions with various non-protagonists in the story (soldiers, commander, City dwellers, Monica, Ghondor, Ethel, the Moebiuses, Z, etc.) shape the whole story. Forget about the drawings of the background, what land they stepped on, the beautiful naturalistic scene they were in, and focus in on the most important: the conversations. Words are what kept and change and form a relationship in the most vibrant form possible. Without words, relationship can only be limited at best, far less vibrant.</p>
<p>Another book one read about while writing this, was <em>Excellent Sheep</em> by William Deresiewicz. As college now mostly abandon liberal arts and teach the science, we stopped learning how to live life. And worse, people like me didn't learn how to make friends properly in school. How? One used to ask my classmates, and they couldn't give one an answer, or even a direction, or just outright ignore one. Say, too emotional for them, or they couldn't face it themselves, or, they too don't know how; things just fall into place for them unconsciously, as if by magic. Alas, there's no magic for one. What can't be learned at college, we will have to learn ourselves in life. It's a sad truth, to require a fantasy story to take one on a relatively short journey through life, as a replacement of the missing liberal arts education in school that teach you how to be a person. Sure, it's flawed: the story itself has some perfection, and the director do make sure that everything get resolved; all these aren't true in real life. Taking the next step to facing crisis in real life is still vital. But still, a muted road is also a road to learn from, accompanied later with liberal arts books (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Books_of_the_Western_World">They called it the Great Books, by Mortimer Adler</a>), and the lifelong process of learning how to be a person begins. For example, Joran in the end felt convinced by them; but in real life, it might as well be, no matter what, he's not convinced. And second, it's too black and white. In real life, even if you're not convinced with the other parties, you can sit down and talk, and most importantly, you don't have to agree with them to understand their viewpoint! In the big, Democrats could understand the Republican (and/or Communists). Protestants could sit down and understand the viewpoint of the Catholics. In the small, you might decide that the most important things in nature are the rocks, but your friend decide it's the trees, and you can sit down and discuss about it without criticizing them, hearing why this guy loves the rocks and what makes them appeal, and why that guy adores the trees and what differences does it makes.</p>
<p>There are a lot of unanswered questions. Like, if Z created the world, who created the off-seeing tunes? Who made it part of the world, part of the culture, in a monarchy-controlled world? If the Moebius were the ones that made it, why, then? Does Z, the voices of those that wanted to live in the endless now, also tainted with their wish to send those that had parted, therefore he created those? Or is it originally not, but was introduced latter by some unknown people (soldiers), and as Z saw some 'productivity gain', therefore incorporate it into the whole culture? These are just guesses. We don't know. Ultimately, a beautiful tune in a sad world may be a lucky impossibility, but it could also be a 100% thing, for sadness can't last without happiness. The Yin cannot live without the Yang.</p>
<p>Another stuff to think about is the Flame Clock. The Flame Clock was no different to the 'railway clock' we use nowadays{{footnote: Yes, railway was deprecated half a century ago, with the advent of personal cars. You still see railways in huge countries like US, Britain, and China; and you still see railways in crowded countries like Singapore; but otherwise, those that don't go through industrial revolution probably just skip railway and prefer cars, at least that's in one's country. Even buses are rare, now that mediocre family can afford cars, and rich families have more cars than family members. }}, and let's skip the 'but'. In the old days, clock are local to each cities; but to ensure we have a universal time for the railway that travels, we standardized the clock, hence the railway clock. It was latter adopted by industrials such that, no matter whether you're hungry or not, you must eat between your allocated timeframe (say, 12-1), when in the past, you eat when you naturally feel hungry. The railway clocks make us unnatural today, being confined to it. And we become slaves to it, with all the "time management timetable" for the sake of "productivity". The slavery is no different from those confined by the Flame Clock -- to chase the Clock all the time, to do things <em>for</em> the clock, <em>because</em> of the clock. And there it is, high up there, overlooking us lowly worms. What differences does it make?</p>
<p>And one had to add: writing emotions is hard. Very, very hard. To express emotions in words, is a pain in the arse. Partly because one never learned how (nor searched how); partly because one never practiced before; partly because fiction writing is so different to non-fiction; and partly because, one just don't know! Though one hopes, with improvements, one could bring you something closer to reality despite.</p>
<p>When one was younger, one used to keep a diary; but because one don't know what to write back then, one only records down the content of the cartoon one watched almost everyday. That was for a few years. Latter when one no longer keeps a daily diary, one still have a random-entry diary where, when one feels like it, or when one have something stressed out, one will write an entry in it. The dates are random, depending on when one feels like it. Even later on, one stopped writing diary altogether, because one started writing blogs; that was in 2021 onwards. And because the content one wrote in a diary mostly equate those one wrote in blogs, one no longer write them. Though, one do make some censorship as blogs are public-facing, while diary is only read by one, if one even read back at it; or in the future, if anyone are to write any autobiography for whatever reason on one, that's a reference, if it survives till then. (It's paper, you know, and one isn't keying them into a computer by any method). Ultimately, at the end of chapter 1, when the Kevesis and the Agnians returned together and sat down by the campfire, and Noah walked to Mio whom were keeping entries in her diary while they started talking about philosophical-deep topics, and when she spoke about the shortness of life (10 terms/years = 520 weeks = 3652.5 days), every single day is a blessing. We who lives 8 times longer than them (80 terms = 4160 weeks) indeed, looked away from monday and looked forward to sunday, starting from when we're in school (if you hate school), and do that for about 4000 times, and you're gone. We're gone. Especially in adult life, all we see is, yes, time passed so fast because weeks goes by so fast; and if we predicted we have 6-digit weeks, you don't feel it; but 4-digit weeks? What if you're in your old age, when it became 3-digit? Every day is a blessing. So, make every day interesting by learning new things or doing something happy or anything that keeps life worth living.</p>
<p>For we should not forget,</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>to live, and learn, a whole lot more.</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mio do really changed one in keeping a proper diary that no longer records about cartoon but to be gratitude of what one did the day, to remember and be aware of what one did the day (than to pass through in fogs, can't even recall). If one wasted a day, say, "One wasted today in being addictive to reading x hours of Chinese novels," for example. Even that's a record that says, yes, life is brief, and one wasted it. What a shame oneself is.</p>

<p>We had used Variant B, which included Mio in the scene, and wearing their new shirt, as the one in the book. Here is the one from the second video, without Mio and his team, and before the changed of clothes. This scene probably played out if you got near his dog tag, can't remember; but one played in Chapter 1, variant B in chapter 2.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One morning.</p>
<p>Eunie, wearing her kevesi battle suit, walked up towards where Guernica's shirt was, knelt down and check a triangular dog tag handing on his shirt. "Are these his dog tags?"</p>
<p>Noah, Lanz, and Riku followed behind. Noah knelt to her left. Lanz stood to his left. Noah read out, "Guernica... Vandham... I guess that's his name."</p>
<p>Eunie, looking sad, "That's great..."</p>
<p>"Huh?" Noah didn't know what Eunie meant by that.</p>
<p>In a low tone, "I kinda hated the idea of not even knowing who he was."</p>

<h2 id="appendix-b-carvings-on-the-memorial-hall"><a class="header" href="#appendix-b-carvings-on-the-memorial-hall">Appendix B: Carvings on the Memorial Hall</a></h2>
<p>Here are the writings that described the items. <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Memorial_Hall">Taken from here.</a></p>
<p>Ouroboros Stone Cage:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The object on display upon this plinth is the very first, original Ouroboros Stone's cage. It's important to note that initial designs for the monuments are said to have included a statue of a Seventh Founder in its place. Next to no information remains about the Seventh Founder's identity, and it is possible that this is not due to a simple loss of records. Rather, historians speculate that this is a result of a conscious decision by the Seventh Founder.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Ortiz (Founded by Nikol{{footnote: Shulk's son.}}):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the founder of House Ortiz and the City's Liberator. A Kevesi soldier, this Founder was released from the Flame Clock system by the other Founders, and henceforth, spent every last ounce of his energy for the cause: to liberate the City as one of the first Ouroboros. With surpassing skill in mechanical engineering, the Founder fought not with a Blade, but with a weapon of his own fabrication. He was also responsible for laying the foundations of all the mechanical system supporting the City to this day. Following the fight against Moebius, he poured the remainder of his days into rebuilding the City, before finally perishing at the age of 80 years, though how he attained that feat despite his origins as a Kevesi soldier remains unexplained.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Reid (Shulk being Founder's mentor):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Reid and the City's Liberatrix. Rather than the Founder herself, this statue depicts the Founder's mentor figure, standing as a sign of the deep reverence and devotion she felt for her teacher. The founder's master was unconnected to her by bonds of blood yet he raised her as would befits child of one's own, it is said. Though of calm and constant disposition, the sight of him on the battlefield, great red sword in hand, struck fear into many a Moebius; and though the vicious struggle against Moebius cost this ferocious warrior his right arm, the loss did nothing to diminish his desire to hone his martial skills each day, standing as vivid testament to his indomitable will.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Doyle (Founded by Na'el):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Doyle and the City's Liberatrix. Directly descended from those who established the first, original City. Her whereabouts were lost after N's ravaging of the City of old, but upon encountering the other Founders, she committed herself fully to the fight. This Founder is said to have a familial relation to the Founder of Vandham, with scant extant records suggesting they were likely brother and sister. She fought alongside the Founder of Vandham then, who was the elder of the two, and brought the power of Ouroboros to completion. Said to have been bright and wise, this Founder laid the cornerstones for much of the City's governance and legal systems.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Vandham (Founded by Matthew{{footnote: N's grandson.}}):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Vandham, and the City's Restorer and Liberator. THe original incarnation of the City was once laid to ruin by Moebius N's hand. The Founder realized fully the power of Ouroboros, heretofore limited, and fought against N, ousting him. Once victorious, he gathered the old City's people, scattered to the winds, and reestablished the City. With the City restored, he left its government in the hands of the Founder Doyle, and departed on a lonely expedition. No records exist of his fate thereafter. Heirs of Vandham's lineage only returned to the new City several centuries later. Oral tradition has it that the Founder was master of the classical art of fist fighting, and the scions of House Vandham carry on the custom to this day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Cassini (Rex being Founder's mentor):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In memory of the Founder of House Cassini and the City's Liberatrix. Much like with the Founder of Reid, this statue, too, depicts this Founder's respected mentor rather than the Founder herself. The mentor boasted a robust physique, wielding 2 great swords at once with utmost ease, and facing down Moebius despite the loss of one eye. He lived his life an unsophisticated sort, broad-minded but impassioned, and is said to have aided the Founders in the fight against Moebius, physically and spiritually. He was further reported to have been a free spirit, whose qualities influenced the other Founders, still young and impressible when the City was restored. Indelible proof of this rebellious spirit can be seen time and again in the ethos of the House in generations to come.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>House Rhodes (Founded by Glimmer{{footnote: Rex's daughter, Mio's different-mum's sister.}})</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A soldier of Agnus, this Founder's fight to the death against the Founder of Ortiz, a soldier of Keves, was interrupted by a chance meeting with other Founders. Freed from the bondage of her Flame Clock, she joined the fight against Moebius. Although a soldier, the Founder is reported to have been exceedingly gentle and kind at heart. Additionally, her skill in the healing arts greatly contributed to the development of medical science in the City in later ages. And irrespective of starting life as an Agnian soldier, she is said to have surpassed 80 years of age, though the way she achieved that remains shrouded in mystery.</p>

<li>By "confounded", one used the definition "to confuse/surprise someone, so that they're unable to explain/deal with a situation" <strong>rather than</strong> the other "expressing anger"</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="xenoblade-specific-terms"><a class="header" href="#xenoblade-specific-terms">Xenoblade Specific Terms</a></h3>
<p>Here are some terms highlighted in the book. More of these information could be found in the <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/">Xenoblade Wiki</a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Agnian Welcoming Stance</strong>: Clench your right hand into a fist and put it by your heart. Refer to its use in <code>Kevesi Welcoming Stance</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Annihilator</strong>: A cannon attached to the Keves Castle, capable of drawing energy from the black fog and fire annihilation events at anywhere it wanted to. Noah's group found a weakness in the design and destroyed it.</li>
<li><strong>Automaton:</strong> Called <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Automaton_Sentry">Automaton Sentry</a> in the wiki, they were levnises used by the Lost Numbers.</li>
<li><strong>Black Fog:</strong> Where black fog appears, annihiliation events became high probable. The Kevesi castle had created an annihilator that harness the black fog's power, a man-made annihilation is thus available.</li>
<li><strong>City:</strong> Where the Lost Numbers lived.</li>
<li><strong>Colony Ranks:</strong> (from the Wiki) Assigned by the castle, it determined their priority in receiving supplies and luxury. In reality, they were created to motivate them to fight furiously, and when they reached Gold, a moebius will come and eliminate them, as they had no way to advance anymore, hence lost their motivation. The ranks, from low to high, are:
<ul>
<li>Dirt</li>
<li>Tin</li>
<li>Copper</li>
<li>Iron</li>
<li>Steel</li>
<li>Silver</li>
<li>Gold</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ferronis:</strong> The colony levnis, flame clock levnis, flame clock war machine. People live in it, or under it, when the colony isn't at war.</li>
<li><strong>Ferronis Hulk:</strong> Dilapidated, demolished, and/or abandoned Ferronis. These are usually rusty.</li>
<li><strong>Flame Clock:</strong> The clocklike figure located at the top of a Ferronis. The flame clock determines the strength of its soldiers. If the flame clock falls to zero, those linked to that flame clock lose their lives.</li>
<li><strong>Interlink:</strong> A Kevesi and an Agnian, joined together, to form an interlink. The interlinked form is called <strong>Ouroboros.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Iris:</strong> Every soldier, Agnian or Kevesi, had an Iris that used for transferring information. Though, this Iris also send information back to the castle; hence Noah's team current location was always known prior to wearing the eyepatch. Linked to the flame clock, the moebius could press a button and their mind would be put to sleep, their body continued fighting against their will. Upon waking up, they won't remember what had happened, except for the sore muscles from muscle memory.</li>
<li>"<strong>Kevesi Welcoming Stance:</strong> It's an official stance to acknowledge some information passed from higher ups, or to welcome someone (like the Consul), or just a formal stance for whatever. Put your left hand into a fist, palm facing inwards, hold it slightly in front of your shoulder (lower or higher probably didn't matter), and stood with both feets together, straight as a log.</li>
<li><strong>Levnis:</strong> The war machines that Agnus and Keves soldiers used in their war. With higher technology, the Agnian levnises could be autonomous, while Kevesi levnises were almost always piloted by a living soldier, except for the one the protagonist built, taking inspiration from Agnian's levnises. Agnian levnises also are capable of antigravity technology, floating their torso above a rounded ball, like the tracking ball in a mouse. Keves levnises use the old-fashioned-but-reliable wheels.</li>
<li><strong>Memorial Hall</strong>: A location in the city where the statues of the Founders stood. A Ouroboros Stone's Cage was there too!</li>
<li><strong>Mio's appreciation stance:</strong> Wrapping her fist with another palm and put it to her chest, as if to appreciate. She did this a lot, so one'd give it a name. This will be in use starting chapter 3.</li>
<li><strong>Moebius:</strong> Also called <strong>Consul,</strong> the true ruler of the world. They all ruled under Z, and they controlled both Kevesi and Agnians. They lived forever, all having strong will to live in the (certain) present moment, unwilling to trample into the uncertain future. Yet, it isn't free. They need to drink lives collected from the flame clock to maintain their immortality.</li>
<li><strong>Mondo:</strong> Taion's weapon, a dove-like kite-shaped paper cards with eyes drew to the surface.</li>
<li><strong>Nopon:</strong> Egglike inhabitants, whom shared their head with their torso, hands shaped like wings, and very short legs. Their usual height ranged below moderate human's thigh. Nopon are usually merchants, but like all inhabitants, there are other Nopons with other skills.</li>
<li><strong>Off-Seer:</strong> Soldiers who "oversee" dead soldiers. Performing an off-seer ritual send the souls trapped lingering in the battlefield to Heaven, releasing them of their need and utmost desire to continual fighting even after their death. The off-seer ritual consisted of playing a melody. The melody slightly differs with Kevesi and Agnians, because Kevesi's black flute (Noah's original flute) is longer than Agnian's white flute (Mio's original flute); hence the longer flute produced a deeper and lower tone than the shorter ones. The real flute is/was available for sell, try search online!</li>
<li><strong>Origin:</strong> The spaceship that was created by both Agnian and Kevesi's most skillful engineers, in order to escape from the final destruction when the two worlds collide. Translator don't know how they open a portal and get together to construct such giant ship before the two worlds joined; but they were successful, saving some genetics information onto the ship that allowed the people to reborn afterwards (because storing their body would be a waste of energy than just storing some juice to recreate their body upon reaching their destination, or upon needing them.) The Lucky Seven was made of Origin's metal, which was the strongest metal in the game, designed to withstand and survive the annihilation effect when the two worlds collide. The Origin later sunk under water for a long time as they combined, and Z took control from the Queens; at least, partial control. The theatre where the Moebius met was inside Origin. Where it was sunk, it created a vortex where ferronises traveling there would be rip into pieces, hence rendering it undiscoverable from either Kevesi or Agnians.</li>
<li><strong>Ouroboros:</strong> Upon an interlink between a Kevesi and an Agnian, their joined form that resembles a monster, got stronger, about two to three times taller than normal human. An ouroboros won't die as long as it's ouroboros core isn't overheat, even if it's butchered into pieces (which will joined back instead).</li>
<li><strong>Ouroboros Core:</strong> (the words itself is explaining). They are located at the chest of an Ouroboros. An ouroboros core will overheat if they stay too long in ouroboros form, or used too much of the limited energy for fighting or for recombination if any body parts got cut off. When it overheat, they either forced themselves exit; if not, they'll explode.</li>
<li><strong>Ouroboros Ring:</strong> Which replaced the flame clock on the iris once one became an ouroboros. It resembles a snake biting its own tail.</li>
<li><strong>Ouroboros Stone:</strong> A stone to create Ouroboros. It was created unfinished by Nia, the Queen of Agnus, finished by Nikol and Riku ages before this story took place to enable interlinking.</li>
<li><strong>Power Frame:</strong> Kevesi soldiers are generally weaker than Agnians. To balance the strength, they wore power frame to boost their strength. Moebius probably prevented the spread of power frame to the Agnians, to ensure their balance of power.</li>
<li><strong>Queen:</strong> The assumed ruler of both Kevesi and Agnians. The Kevesi Queen was Melia Antiqua, from Xenoblade 1, resided in the castle that resembles Imperial Capital Alcamoth; the Agnian Queen was Nia, from Xenoblade 2, one is unsure of (or forgot about) the structure resemblance of the castle.</li>
<li><strong>Saffronia:</strong> The tree associated with Nimue's original colony: a peaceful colony away from battle, planted food for themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Sena's encouraging stance</strong>: she put both her arms like a boxing defense move; and if she nod her head, it seems encouraging; if she don't, she seemed curious or asked for pity.</li>
<li><strong>Swordmarch:</strong> The original location of the city before it moved later in the chapter.</li>
<li><strong>Taion's Thinking Stance</strong>: This didn't refer to one single stance. He usually put one arm around his waist or higher, the other resting on it. Sometimes, his fingertips were pushing his glasses up. Sometimes, he put them in front of his mouth, clenched lightly. Sometimes, he puts his arms lower, some distance below his chin.</li>

<li>The cutscenes are taken from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXDE1P7WvI8&amp;list=PLpVpBRIlzWuBPW1F4h7t1bJwl1567hzfY&amp;index=3">this playlist on YouTube</a>. As it has no subtitle, one also refer to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnuRO8WfZWc&amp;t=382s&amp;ab_channel=BeardBear">this (second) video for the subtitles</a>. The latter was used most due to the availability of subtitles. Because the cutscenes are separated by game in between, we would join the cutscenes that seems to match a single scene, than to have them slip into separate chapters. The chapters do not match the game chapters, as if it is, it would be too long a single chapter, which isn't (too long) in video but is when put in words. Both these video evade some non-worded cutscenes, with the second totally evading all. Therefore, in case where one think the scene needs inclusion, one'll get it from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me1dXXWnlbM&amp;t=7711s&amp;ab_channel=Gamer%27sLittlePlayground">this (third) video</a>.
