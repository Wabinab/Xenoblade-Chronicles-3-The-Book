# The Eclipse

(The other not yet finish editing. Finish that first.)

> **Translator's Note on Environment:** Soldiers traversing up and down a dark central alleyway, with only occasional lights mounted on to beams. Another scene: more soldiers walking around a booth that looks like a reception, though no one sit behind the desk. There were doors 'behind' the reception, but we can't see what's the function of the room except some soldiers speaking with each other. Still another scene: on an empty tiled field, buildings around the empty space. Fire torches lined both side of the empty space's central alleyway; at the front was an elevated stage. More pillars grown behind the elevated stage. We could see this is a zoom in version of **Agnus Castle Region.** 

---

One soldier shoved Noah into the cell. Eunie, Taion, Riku and Manana, Lanz, and Sena were already inside. Noah turned around and see the soldier closed the gate. Inside another cell beside theirs, Mio was locked up by herself. Seeing their duties done, the soldiers leave the heavily-guarded prison.{{footnote: In hindsight, this is where the first scene on one's note on environment came: to both side of the alleyway lined the heavily-guarded prisons that locked the group.}}

---

Seconds after seconds, minutes after minutes, Noah forcefully shook and punch the metal grate, to no avail. 

---

Leading a punch was his anger, "**Sparks! It's just a metal grate. Why can't I break it?!**"{{footnote: At least in this page, bold means strongly expressed, loud, heightened voice/tone; while italics meant soft, desperate, desolate, crying, loss of hope; or if used by the enemy, italics meant softly spoken. It if was both italicized and boldened, it was just one highlighting the phrase worth writing down in your diary!}} He punched and punched and launched himself at it, kicked it. 

Taion can't stand it, stood up and remarked, "**Cool it, Noah!** They've stripped us of our powers. There's no way for us to break it! Just give it a rest."

"How can I 'give it a **rest**'?!" All the while he was inching every drop of energy he had at the grate. "We have to get through! **We have to get Mio out...!**"

---

One afternoon. 

The sun shone through the windows into an alleyway, into the cell. Noah tilted his head up to see N arriving outside, speaking to him, "Surprisingly well-behaved. I half-expected you to have blown a hole in the wall by this point. Or what? _Have you resigned yourself wholly to your plight, knowing the extent of my power?_" Noah's breathe got heavier as he looked and listened to the guy that looked at him like a master looking at a slave{{footnote: i.e. how you 'look down' on people.}}.

"Did you come to gloat? Where's Mio?"

"The girl, you'll find... is in the cell beside you."

"Huh?" He was surprised. Despite all the punching and kicking, she didn't made a sound. 

"Call out her name, why don't you? Your voice, at least, should reach." He gritted at the cruelty he did to him and her, to them. Ignoring his anger, he continued, "Oh, I see. You still cling to a sliver of hope.{{footnote: He turned to face the window, back facing Noah.}} **You recall**... I wanted to stage a little sideshow. You expecting applause? _It's the Homecoming._"

"Huh?" Now that wasn't just Noah alone, but his companion too. 

"Hrmph... I'm glad you catch on quick. With the eclipse... _one month from now. The girl will meet her long-awaited end._ **Why don't we honor it at the Castle?**{{footnote: This showing the empty tiled field scene, the final scene translator mentioned in the environment note at the very top of this page. But since the scene before was showing night time, and this is afternoon, we can see Swordmarch in the distance, blurry behind clouds.}} Make it a day to remember?" N turned to face Noah with a grim{{footnote: His hands like a V-shape and shaking them to show strength and elation.}}, "**Well?! Does that not** _please you?_ **What a magnificent sideshow it will be! MUAHAHAHAHAHA!!!**"

Noah lose his patience and jumped on his feet, hands against the metal grate, shaking it. 

N still hadn't finished yet, "Oh, yes... I almost forgot to tell you something. You are now aware of the cycle of rebirth, yes? There is an exception."

"Huh...?" The quivering breath he breathe out as he watched N approached him and spoke quietly toward his ears. 

"_Those whose flame is snuffed out during a Homecoming... will not return._" His iris extended to maximal strain, trembling as they were. The others were so shocked at the news they jumped onto their legs. There on the other cell, Mio was standing, looking inwards, upwards, as if she was reminiscing. 

Noah's eyes wavered left and right, up and down for a moment while he tried to swallow their upcoming fate. His anger not yet fade, "**You monster!!!**" He stuck his hands out and punched N on his shoulder. "Urrrrgggaaahhhh..." N attacked him with a jab in his thigh with the back of his sword. Slowly, his legs lose power and he fell to the ground. 

"_Hehehehe.... So weak._ Amusingly so... Right now, all of you put together... _don't have the strength of a single soldier._" Putting his hands and caressing it, "Not even these flimsy iron bars... _yield to your efforts. Try all you like, but you cannot escape. No amount of toil will help you there._"

Still groaning in pain, he gave N the stern look. 

N continued, "You feel the anguish? _Crippling despair?_ That is the hubris. _Of fools who cling blindly to their hopes... only to find them dashed on the rocks. Of dreamers, _crushed under the sheer weight of reality. Of abject failures._"

---

Another night. 

Repeated punches at the door. "**Come on! Come on! COME ON!!!**" 

Lanz gripped on the punching hand tainted with bleeding knuckles, sternly calling at him, "**That's enough!** You're just gonna break your hands!"

He forcefully swung his hand away from his grip, desperately called out, "**I don't care! I'll shatter every bone in my body... if that's what it takes!**"

"**Just stop! Please!**" 

Noah immediately grabbed the metal grate, trying to look towards the right, to see the shadow of the beauty he'd been worrying all along. Desolately, he asked, "_Mio? A-are you OK?_"

There was a moment of silence, the group had their ears wide opened.{{footnote: Just for your info, the distance between the two adjacent cells were several meters apart: the sheer thickness of the wall between, though!}} Sitting on the ground was Mio, her feet pulled back, her arms wrapped around her feet. She softly replied, "_Don't worry about me. I'm... totally fine._ I've made... my peace. Even if I can never leave here, I'm content. I'll live on in others. Knowing that is enough for me... Please... don't worry." As she finished, she lowered her head into her laps, quietly weeping. 

Tears were aggregating in the eyes of those on the other cells. Taion sit back down besides Eunie. Noah felt his heart ripped apart, "Mio..."

---

Sliding into the cell was some red (tomato/carrot/whatever) soup, a dome-shaped bread, and a spoon on a tray. Manana, seeing that food arrived, brought it and put it in front of Noah, whom was looking down, his back against the wall, in a meditative state. Hearing the sound, he looked up and saw her starry eyes. He shook his head; had no appetite, and went back into meditative state. Manana looked down, feeling sad at his rejection of her favorite. That was the last of the distribution. She walked back to her place beside Riku's. Nobody was touching their plates. 

Lanz suddenly voiced out softly, "Hey... Why d'you think it is, that they look like Noah and Mio...?"

Eunie: "Like I know! Why don't you ask 'em yourself?"

Sena: "When we kick the bucket, we're reborn in those cradles, right? Maybe it's... somehow connected to that?"

Lanz: "You think they're the same people? Is that _even_ possible?"

Taion: "It's strange. Regardless, why would they do this? What possible purpose **could all this serve**? It's almost... like they're **toying with us** just for kicks."

Eunie remarked, recalled from her availability biases, "You know, they've all been like that. When they took away lives... it was like they were enjoying it."

Riku questioned that thought "That{{footnote: Oh my, Riku, you shouldn't say "That's"!!! Nopon had no "'s" in their dictionaries!}} really true?"

"Huh?" The group was confused. Even Noah was surprised. 

"It seem natural **to laugh** when happy. And yet... N had sadness in eyes... _it seemed_.{{footnote: Remember, Riku is really skilled at looking into other people's eyes, or he wouldn't have knew Noah being able to call his blade while he visited him ages ago.}}"

"Huh..." Noah tried to recall what he saw. 

Lanz didn't agreed with him, stood up with anger, "Like spark he did. He's Moebius. Our sworn... _enemy_."

---

After Eunie slid the emptied tray out of their cell, she sighed, "Hmph... We really are hopeless. Can't believe we're stuck in here, behind these snuffin' bars." Even her hope started to wade. 

Taion logically argued, "It wouldn't be much of a prison if they didn't perform that function."

Lanz: "Come on..."

"Hmph..."

Sena desolately questioned, "Was there even any point in all this? In everything we've done?" The group sat around alone or in groups of two, thought about her questioning, or maybe just self-indulged in their own thoughts. 

"Course there was." Noah stood up, affirmative. 

"Huh?" She watched him walked towards a wall. 

"At least... We gave them hope." Above where he was facing was a giant barred window that gave view of the starry night sky. "Urgh..." That doesn't ease his pain. He gave several punches at the wall. 

Lanz turned his head away on his act, "At first... even when Guernica said... he was six times older, it didn't click. **_Past ten years was pure greed_**, I thought. **But now...** I'm scraping... for whatever I can get." The group looked down silently, as if to agree, to want to hold on to their lives as long as possible, to live in the now. 

With wavering breath, Noah shook his head{{footnote: Unsure what he was thinking. Maybe fighting between thought?}}. 

---

Inside the City, by a flying ship. 

Soldiers assembled in front of Ghondor. The Ouroboros candidates nodded at her. After that, they dashed off in several directions, leaving her alone. Monica approached her, questioned her sternly, "_What_ are you doing?"

"Huh?" She looked at to see whom was approaching, only to tilt her head back down, "_Oh, the Bitchqueen herself_."

She don't care about that label, "**Where do you think you're going?**"

"**Where d'you think I'm going?**"

"You know I can't allow this."

"**'Scuse me?!**"

"**That's a direct order. Don't be stupid!**"

"**Whatever...** Up yours."

"**Look, the Castle is on maximum alert now. Are you in that much of a hurry to get back behind bars?!**"

"Tch..."

"This ain't like the time we ambushed Keves, when we **had the element of surprise.**"

"**After all they did for me, I can't just leave 'em! We don't have time for this!**"

"**And I'm telling you its suicide!**" She gave her a shocking breath. "**Noah entrusted everything to us. Hope... The future...**" Looking at the Cloud Keep key which she wore back around her neck, Monica continued, "**Get that through your skull!**"

"Ugh..."

Some purple particles gathered, and someone appeared inside the City, probably a Moebius. Monica was shocked to see his/her arrival. "**You...?!**" Ghondor turned to see who (s)he was. 

---

The moonlight shone into Mio's cell. She stood up, walked under the light, and looked out the window. The half-moon (left side dark) that hung brightly on the sky kept her time. 

---

Not Noah alone, but the whole group helping to bang at the metal grate, trying their hardest to free themselves. More than half the moon shone. 

---

Trying to pull the grate apart; they even managed to get Sena on to the window high above, where she tried to pull it apart, or maybe squeezing through, to no avail. She dropped down thereafter; Lanz caught on to her. Three-quarter of the moon brightly lit. 

---

Tired, some gripped onto the metal grate, while the rest sat down, too tired to try. Taion paced left and right, thinking of another solution. The full moon brightly hung on the sky. 

---

Lanz was the only one still punching the grate. The moon was nearly-full (right side dark). 

---

Noah and Lanz used their elbow to bang against the grate. Lanz fell on his back and slept on the ground, hopeless of their effort. Noah tried harder. The moon was slightly more than half. 

---

Even with both his knuckles bleeding, he continued banging against the grate unwaveringly. His eyes getting watery, he caught hold on the grate and dropped to the ground in a knelt position desolately, his hands lose force and dropped down, hanging. 

---

One evening. The group sat down in their thoughts. Eunie looked deeply on her past's dog tag. Taion was standing up, perhaps still thinking of what unthought ways there were. Manana distributed food when the time came. Not even a nod, not even a look, not even a reaction from any one of them. She put the tray down anyways before wading her way back at her place. 

Riku looked at their lost of hope; his eyes gleaned brightly, never losing hope. He was waiting, waiting, waiting... Noah hadn't yet understood. 

---

Sena looked up and saw her approaching, softly called out, "Shania..."

Lanz: "What are you doing here?"

"Got a little update for you."

Eunie calmly remarked, "This will be good."

"The day your friend departs this world... What did you call it? Homecoming...? That's the day... I've decided to have myself killed too." She pointed at her iris; the thin flame clock glowed on her eyes. 

Sena stood up, surprised, "Shania... Your Iris...!"

"Yep! This right here is proof that I've joined their ranks." As she turned and walked away, she finished her sentence, "And your little friend will vanish from this world forever. But... _I_ will be born once again! **Just the way I should be!**"

"Hurgh!!!" Noah dashed at her and caught hold of the cell door, gritting his teeth at such attacks on his philosophy, or maybe her attacks on Mio. 

"AHAHAHAHA!!!" She was elated at his reaction. "**That's just the reaction I was hoping for.** Ahh, it's beautiful. I hope I can make that face too... when I meet my enemies **on the battlefield.**"

Even Taion can't hear more, "Piss off, eyesore." Eunie stood up with him. 

"Oh, don't you worry. I'll be gone soon. _Pretty much as soon as your friend will_. **HAHAHAHAH!!!**" This time, she's really leaving them alone. 

Sena felt regretful, "It was so obvious, looking back. I knew that something was off about her. I knew deep down. I just... I didn't want to believe that we were the same..."{{footnote: Philosophically, in the real world outside fiction, you can't trust your memory. One could say, one knew deep down that Covid would spread to the whole world, after the last global epidemic hadn't spread for so long, to wipe out any risk we have, just like the stock market crashes every few decades at the very least to wipe out risk. But hey, one's memory had been playing trick on one -- it's called hindsight bias.}}

"You're not the same." 

She rushed to the bars and asked, "Is that Mimi...?"

Sitting down in the arms-around-her-legs position, she looked up as she replied, "I was watching you. Trying so hard. You saved us so many times... never giving up. You helped us get here. Sometimes... you can be really hard on yourself. I think... _that's why you've always been so hungry, always striving for more._"

Her tears started swelling up as she was getting recognized, what she'd hoped for long, "_Yeah..._"

"Come now... I know you've touched so many lives. I think... we've all seen that."

"_Yeah... Hrngh... Yeah. I know. I see it now... I'm sorry..._"

"Come on. You really need to stop saying that you're sorry."

"_Yeah... Sorry!_" Her tears slid down her cheeks and drop to the ground. 

"It's all right. Don't give up." Looking out at the windows, "**_Because time... is still on our side._**" Half moon shone through the giant window (right side dark), slowly engulfing it. 

---

Everyone sat quietly by a corner. Taion had one Mondo on the floor, his fingers touching it.{{footnote: How did he hid it from the enemy's sight, or summon it? Probably it's not summoned but, like the Nimue's clock, it doesn't depend on the Iris. As on how he hid it, we don't know.}} Eunie tugged her legs up, elbow on her knees, making a diamond shape in between, her head on the back of her palm. Taion voiced out calmly, "So then... Tomorrow."

"Do you think an off-seer... can ever reach others? You know... I thought... our lives were like our music... Always in our hands, under our control{{footnote: He look at his palm in the process.}}... I wasn't facing the truth." Looking out at the starry night sky, "_Even if I could reach people, I wouldn't be able to save them. I should've known that._ Pffff" He clenched his fist, gritted his teeth, tears aggregating at the tip of his eyes, "_It's unbearable... seeing lives slip away from you..._ **Even though they're right there... What am I even doing...**"

"It's dark out, huh...? No moon." Mio's calm voice called a halt to the desolating moment. 

"_Huh?_" He turned and looked outside the window. 

"But... the starlight... It's so nice and warm..."

"_Mio..._"

"Hey... When the two of us first met... You asked me if I wanted to survive."

He took a moment to recall, softly answered, "_Yeah._"

"I replied... I didn't mind either way."

He slowly raised his heads in steps, as if his muscles twitched again and again, "_Yeah..._"

Mio took a few moments to muster her courage and her words, "I'll correct that. Now I... want to live. **To live, and learn... a whole lot more...** _Noah..._ There's so much for us to see..."

"Huh..." His eyes widened, "Finally... **_You called me by my name._**"

"Oh, yeah... sorry..." she continued amidst his mixture of tears of relief and desolation, "I guess I felt that... **_if I did... my heart would downright break. Because... I'd be admitting the truth._**"

"Mio..."

"But you know, these feelings that grew within me... They're thanks to you." All the while he kept weeping on her words. She slowly rested her head on the wall and closed her eyes; the dim starlight caressed illumination on her silhouette, "That's why... **_you're not allowed to say... it's been for nothing. You've enriched my life, Noah._** That's clear now."

"Mio..."

Eunie cried out hearing their conversations, "Urgh!" Taion took repeated punch on the floor, feeling effete he can't do anything to release their situation. Sena was deep in tears. Even Lanz can't hold back. Manana hugged Riku from behind, both teary-eyed. 

"You know... I don't want this to be it. _If I were given the chance..._ **If this road I've walked... were to keep on going...** **_I'd like to spend that time... with my Noah._**" She looked up, full of imagination, put up a thin smile before facing her inevitable.{{footnote: Like every other ones whom made it to their homecoming before her; they could do nothing but to embrace.}} 

Noah put his palm on his forehead as tears slid down the side of his cheek. As he weep in the background, she looked out of the window, the stars that had accompanied her for so long. 

---

The morning light rose from the horizon{{footnote: The stars dimmed out from view.}}; the beam brightened the interior of the cell. Mio had her diary on her laps, writing into it the last record she will have in her life. As she sliced out the final diamond with her fountain pen, she gently caressed the final page of her calendar, looking attentively on the currently opened pages, before finally closing it, completing her final chapter. 

---

The moon almost entire covered the Sun: it's beam made a ring around it. The imperfect moon made a "knob"-like circle of light on the left side, allowing more light to pass through.{{footnote: Just like "Apple"'s apple is an imperfect apple that had taken a bite, if you get what one meant.}}

In front of lots of Agnian soldiers, Noah and the others were escorted to kneel before the elevated stage. His eyes were still quivering, deep feelings down within. Even Riku and Manana had electrical chains around them (instead of handcuffs, since they're oval). Noah looked up the stage. Besides some soldiers, probably those participating in the Homecoming tune, he saw X with the apocrypha staff on the left side, Shania standing some distance beside her. On the other side, N and M. The atmosphere was quiet. 

Suddenly, there was a roar of cheering, and someone shouted, "My Queen!" Noah and the others looked up to look at the stage. 

"Your Majesty!"

There was a floating throne above the elevated stage; there stood the Queen of Agnian{{footnote: The fake one, of course.}} with her mask on, opening her arms as if to embrace her fellow citizens. The lot chanted, "Queen Nia! Queen Nia! Queen Nia!" 

She then raised her hands to silenced the soldiers, and started her majestic speech: "Trace our ancestry back a thousand years, and you will find an off-seer, carrying out the first Homecoming. Now, in Agnus, no fewer than nine hundred and ninety-nine lives{{footnote: What the sparks... Just so you know, these are fake numbers used to make something look big.}}... have returned themselves to me. It is an auspicious day. I believe such is your view. Yet, for me, it is a day that brings heartache.{{footnote: Shania look grimly, M looked slightly sad.}} I wish... nothing more than the safe return of all life born of me. Such is my eternal hope. To come home is to find comfort." 

As the speech continued in the background, Taion, listening to the speech, remarked, "Quite the elaborate production."

Lanz effetely replied, "Fancy. Another _puppet_ on display."

Eunie: "Assuming Monica's intel was true."

Sena, with her teary tone, "It's all been so pointless... Fighting for that thing."

"She's a phony, that's what she is. Even if it's her in the flesh up there, **I'll rip her off her high horse!**" She slowly loosen the grip on her hands, asked, "You think, uh... _They're gonna execute us too after this?_"

Lanz: "_Guess so._"

As she got teary, "So it's... back into the cycle. Back into the same old crap _again_. _Wish we could've gone a little further._"

"_Same here._"

Taion: "The key's in Ghondor's hands now. I think we've done enough."

Sena tried to convince herself, "Yeah, we've passed the torch. Now, it's up to the City."

The soldiers standing behind them had had enough, sniped at them, "**Shut up! Keep it quiet!**"

Eunie: "Tch."

The Queen's speech is coming to an end: "...That returns to me. As perpetual raiment{{footnote: The heck, this is how it sounds, not the actual words, nor do we have the subtitles for this.}} warriors." The Eclipse had gone to its full strength, darkening the sky. As she finished her speech, the soldiers standing on the elevated stage brought their flutes on to their lips and chimed the Homecoming tune with full strength, swaying with the melody. Noah could only mustered a sigh. 

"Noah giving up? Now of all time?"

Surprised, he peered over his shoulder at Riku, his eyes still bright with hope, and he rebutted, "_I don't want to give up_. But we're... trapped here. Our Blades... Tchhhhh... I hope at least... _she can... go in peace..._"

Riku had high expectations for him, sighed at his downright depression. He cannot help but give him a direction, as he waited and waited and waited to no avail that he could discover the direction himself. "**Of course Noah trapped. Noah still not tried to draw Lucky Seven!**"

"Huh?"

"Remember? Back when Riku give wisdom? When need of true power, sword will appear."

"_Yeah... I remember._"

"Today is day of need. **_Even at edge, facing sheer drop, must never give up._**"

"Riku..." His attention is disturbed as the sound of door opening from the left. He turned and saw two soldiers pulled open the door, Mio behind the gap, escorted by 2 soldiers. 

"**Mimi...**" Sena knelt higher, followed by Taion. 

"Ahuh..." The calmness that he displayed, the desolation that he emanated, all dissipated as they turned into quivering fear of losing her. Slowly, they watched her taking a step after another towards the stage. 

"**Mio!**" 

She passed in front of them, looking around but not into their eyes, as she turned her back to them as they{{footnote: Mio and her escorting soldiers.}} reached the staircase leading up the stage. A step after another, she did not look back. 

"**MIO!!! MIOOOOOOOO!!!**"  He tried to got up on his feet and ran towards her. Two soldiers from behind quickly reacted and pushed him onto the ground. 

Hearing his shouts, she stopped at the very top of the ledge; or maybe, she'd just reached the end. The two soldiers aggressively came forward, grabbed her shoulders, and pushed her down into a knelt, then released their grab on her. 

On the other side, Noah saw N walking towards him, the soldiers still pushing him on to the floor. N gave the soldiers a look; he remotely broke his handcuffs, and the soldiers followed by releasing the grip on him. He slowly clambered up, only to see N rolling his old flute (the Kevesi one, black flute, the one he used before exchanging with Mio) at him. Sternly, he instructed, "Pick it up." As Noah tried to assess the situation, he continued, "You're an off-seer. _So send her_." 

His iris diminished into a dot, but he didn't move. N continued nudging, "What's wrong? Go on, send her. Isn't that your role? **Isn't she _your_ Mio?!**" 

He slowly climbed up into a knelt, with quivering hands, grabbed on the flute with both hands. As he raised his head, yellow motes already rising from Mio's body. He was too horrified; he lost his strength, his flute{{footnote: together with his hands}} dropped to the ground. The others were deep in desolation; Taion closed his eyes, unable to withstand the situation. 

As the moon totally covered the Sun, making an almost perfect ring, Mio's motes dissipated quicker and quicker. Noah knelt higher as he watched her, as if he wanted to reach out for her. Looking back over her shoulder, her eyes met Noah's. A month of crying had not wipe his tears clean. "**_It's been fun... Noah._**"

"Mio..." The final impression she had carved into their mind was her smile; a globule of yellow swallowed her before her belongings dropped to the floor. Her motes rose like lanterns, carried away were her hopes, her dreams, her feelings, her wishes, her conviction, her legacy. 

The group silently burst into tears amidst Noah's heartbreaking cry, "**MIOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!**" M closed her eyes as she resisted her own feelings. 

With widely-opened arms, the Queen look at the sky, as if to embrace those who returned. All that left on the floor was her shirt and her old flute (the Agnian one, white flute, before exchanging with Noah). 

As the Sun regained its dominance, the darkness shied away, N, full of desolation in his eyes, watched Noah openly shedding tears, both hands and head on the ground. The sideshow hadn't made him happier, nor felt more entertaining. It's like re-walking the road that leads to the loss of hope, again and again, again and again, with no future. He had had enough. It's time to end.

Two soldiers walked forward and grabbed both his hands, pulled him up. N walked to the left of him, pulled out his sword, ready to execute him. After he raised the sword over his head, he forcefully slashed downwards, the sound of metal clashing against metal was last heard of.
