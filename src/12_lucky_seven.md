# Lucky Seven

===

As the night falls, they continued on their path after a nice cool bath. The sandy wind gusted in front of them, where rocks weren't blocking. Mio, at the penultimate line with Riku and Manana, looked back and see Noah falling far behind. She stopped and waited for him to catch up before continued her steps. 

"Hey! Can I ask you something?" He turned his attention to her as she continued, "It's special, isn't it? Your Blade, I mean." 

"Um?" He wasn't sure what she meant. 

"Sometimes, one part of it... glows. Why's that?" 

"Ah...! You can tell? That's amazing..." 

"It's hard not to." 

"Ah, right." There was a moment of silence. 

Mio broke the silence, in a lower tone, "Is it a secret?" 

"No, I can tell you."

### Start of Memories

Back in the training ground. Young Noah, along with other soldiers, drew his blade. He was wearing a helmet and bullet-proof vest like others. His blade wasn't any different from a standard Kevesi sword. The other people were already slashing and practicing with their blades while he tried to get a holding. We could see there are a variety of weapons, like Lanz's broadsword; others uses "boxing's gloves", which emitted cyan glows at its square front, plotted with 4 rows of grid that looked like a well. Still others practiced shooting at humanoid targets with their guns. There were also some using staffs, swirling their staff mid-air while ether aggregated. As they called their ranged arts, balls of energy shot down from high in the air onto the ground in front of them, with small explosion. 

As other people practiced, the group gathered together, Lanz practicing his broadsword. Eunie summoned her blades and swing it around adeptly like how one would swing a long wooden stick. As she pointed her rifle end to an imaginary target, her staff rotated quickly, absorbing the surrounding ether energy and shot it from the front. She almost fall to her back as Newton's third law took effect, but managed to jumped and step on the ground as the force dissipated. She reloaded to try again, panting. 

Joran summoned his short staff that looked like a mace, with a ball of energy already glowing at its tip. As he made some moves, a green ring appeared with him in the center. He tried to launch some attacking moves but failed, however he tried. Going all out, the green ring extends its radius, glowing even brighter before returning to normal glow. He wiped off his sweats from his forehead thereafter. 

Noah's blade was laid on the fence. He took it up and practiced slashing. 

As the group practiced, Garvel's team came forward with their blades, his on his shoulder, "Noah, my man... Are you still playing around with that little toy?" Except for Noah and Lanz, others stopped to look at them approaching. 

The broadsword girl teased, "Have you considered a Nopon weapon? You might actually get somewhere with that." Noah wasn't disturbed. 

Garvel shouted back at him, "Oi! You deaf or what, Noah?!" 

Joran, his sound shaking, "Garvel!? Noah, this is bad..." 

Garvel had walked beside him: "Heh. Not even a peep? Don't need to pay us any attention?" 

Noah continued practicing as he replied, "Oh please... I wasn't ignoring you. Once I finish this set... we can chat!" He turned and made for a slash. It send an air shockwave that shocked Garvel's team. 

Eunie was amused, her staff over her shoulder, standing beside Joran. Noah was still focused on his blade as he stood up slowly. Then, he turned his attention at Garvel. 

"Well? What were you saying?" 

"Noah...," Garvel shouted back at him, "For dead weight, you're a right snuffing peacock!" With his blade, his eyes concentrated on Noah as he dashed at him. Noah dodged his slashes. 

"Ugh, you...!" His agility outpaced Garvel's sword-swinging speed. "You slippery little mudder!" He continued his blows. One thrust forward, Noah managed to step on it with his foot, shocking Garvel, while he placed his blade over his neck while he tried to pull it out. 

Patiently, "Well, anything else?" 

"You... snuffin' weakling!" He pulled his sword upward, then kicked Noah in the chest. He sliced his sword and broke Noah's sword. 

"Blast it all!" Then, he punched Noah in the face as he falls. Wasn't satisfied, he decided to continue the bullying, "Oh, you'll... get it now!" He sliced his sword as Lanz blocked. 

"L-Lanz?!" 

"Break it up now," Lanz told him, "Didn't know you could be so petty, Garvel." 

"Peh. Ain't got no time for this musclehead." He bit his words between his teeth as he put his sword back to his shoulder. 

"Wanna say that again?" Lanz was prepared for another battle. 

"Hmph! We'll settle this properly... In tomorrow's trial!" He sheathed his blade as he turned and walked away, shouting to his group, "Move it!" Noah's group just watched him leave. 

Joran quickly ran up by his side, still sitting on the ground, "Noah, are you OK?" 

---

Noah and his team were sitting by a ladder. Eunie was standing, her back against the wall. Lanz turned his body to face him as he tried to cheer Noah up, "Don't let it get to you. Guys like that are the first ones to snuff it in a real battle." 

"No, I'm not worried about him. I really can't call my weapon, though... I worry I'll end up being a burden." 

"Never thought that here, not even once." 

"Thanks... Kind of you to say." 

"It's just the truth!" As he finished, Noah walked off. "Where are you going?" 

He paused his steps to explain, "To visit Riku. Since it broke. The trial -- it's tomorrow. I'm gonna need a new weapon for that." As he walked off into the alleyway, Lanz and the others followed. 

---

At Riku's place. Some cylinders were placed at the side, but the center of focus is a sword with shiny silver thin blade. Between the blade and the joint was a circle ring. The handle had purple center with backbone-like golden joints, probably to increase grip. It was being hoisted on a sword holder in the center of the room. 

"What's this?" The group looked at the sword as Noah asked. 

Riku folded his wings as he explained its origin, "Magic sword, Lucky Seven! In distant past, were seven legendary swordsmithpon. Over course of seven years, forged sword from seven types of steel. No other sword like it in existing." 

"Magic?" The kids weren't convinced. 

"Lucky Seven?" Lanz questioned. 

Riku wasn't amused, he tried to proof it, "Lanz, please to give good cleave with Blade and split clean in halves." 

"Sure 'bout that? Better not pull some, 'You break it, you bought it' sneaky sorta deal..."  

Riku opened his eyes wide, "Riku would never dream! Just put all of heft into mighty swing!" 

"Weird ask... Eh, sure!" He summoned his blade to try, "You want me to cut it, I'll cut it, I guess." As he put his broadsword over his head, "Here it comes!" 

With a single slice, his broadsword split into half, shocked. Riku smiled, he knew it all along. Lanz recalled his weapon. 

Noah exclaimed, "Queen's beans! There's not even a nick in it!" 

"Friend surprised? Indeed, is most prized of swords. Even armor of Ferronis get sliced to itsy bits!" Noah's eyes couldn't leave Lucky Seven now. 

Without confidence, he mentioned, "I think... I'll pass." Lanz and Eunie looked at him, shocked by his reply. 

"Pass?" Riku himself wasn't sure why. "So, you not have need for?" 

"Yeah. It's too strong." 

"Hmmmm..." Riku thought for a while, asked again, "Noah want Lanz and friends to kick buckets?" 

To which he immediately rebuted, "No, what the spark?!" 

"Same as letting friends die." 

"No it's not." 

"If friends not fight, cannot survive." 

"Sure, but I don't need to use your sword." 

"Then, why Noah not call Blade?" The others was confused what he meant. 

Noah explained, "It's not out of choice, I just can't..." 

Riku cut him off, eyes seriously looking at him, "False! Riku see through like transparent!" Noah drew a step back. He continued, "Noah _can_ call Blade! Just no big desire of fighting spirit!" 

"Riku..." 

Lanz prompted, "Hey, is he serious?" He sighed. Lanz took a step forward, raising his tone "Noah?" A blade appeared before his face. Noah drew out his blade, then sheathed it. Lanz took a step backward. 

"What the... All this time, huh?" he was shocked. Noah's head was looking down on the floor, didn't dare to face him. 

Riku lectured, "If death is not option, should live. Only way is fight like life depends. Thinking of self... alone... is way of coward. Though, Riku know feeling well." 

"I'm afraid..." He spoke tempestuously. 

"Of fighting, you mean?" Lanz asked. He shook his head. 

"Of this world. It's so brutal and relentless. And I'm afraid of what... we might... become." 

"Mate..." Lanz looked at him, felt. 

Riku the mentor cheered him, "Ohoho! Riku knew Noah was hero material!"

"Huh?" Noah wasn't sure what he meant. 

Riku looked at Lucky Seven, explained, "It true this sword possess incredible power. Might even rob enemies of many-much lives, yes. But, only those who understand nature of terror have right to wield..." Then, he looked back at Noah, "Eh, quote masterpon of Riku, anyhaps." 

"So, if Noah can call Blade now, can still keep Lucky Seven, maybe in some kind of disguise. In different words, can turn it into sheath." 

"Sheath...?"

"Can use it in fights like normal. But if ever push come to shove... Time will come when Noah truly need Lucky Seven's strength. Then, is only matter of drawing." 

"When I truly need its... strength." He thought, his eyes on the sword. He didn't understand yet. 

"Exact," Riku assured, "If Noah never lose sight of that feeling, one day, such time surely come." 

He looked back at Riku, "That is, if I can master it..." 

"If fail to master, just give back. Can pick out different one!" Riku assured. 

"Ah, right..." He seemed to be convinced. 

"Please not to feel specially indebted to Riku -- just take! No need for overthinkings!" 

By now, he had cheered up a little, "Hah! OK. I accept your offer. Oh, and... Riku?" 

"What is?" 

"Mind if I... change the name?" 

"Meh?" 

He smiled back and scratched his neck, "'Lucky Seven' just isn't doing it for me..." 

"Aww...." Riku look disappointed.

As the group continued to traverse the desert, Mio was curious, "So... what name did you end up picking?" 

"Huh? Uh... Name?" He turned to look at the sky for a moment.
 
"Uh-huh!" In a teasing tone, "You don't wanna say? Or what, is it that embarrassing?" 

"N-no... It's not embarrassing. That's not it." He looked down at the ground after rebuting. 

Mio giggled, "Haha... I'm getting strong... emotional vibes here." 

"I wouldn't say 'emotional' per se... Rather..." He looked back up into the sky, lost in thoughts, "something I miss. Yeah." Then, he turned to her, "You know, you're the second one that's noticed this weapon." 

"Really? Is that something special?" 

"It is." 

"And the first? Who was it?"

"She's incredible," He didn't reply directly, "And we... owe her our lives." 

---

Ethel's colony. Lights outside the ferronis control room had been lighted red, as if it were in emergency. Soldiers were talking on the extending fenced platform near the roof of the control room. Ethel was inside the control room, looking out of the windows. Her right iris glowed blood red.
