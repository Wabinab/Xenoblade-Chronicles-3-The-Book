# Hope's Rest

(The previous hadn't yet edited. Edit that first.)

===

From an elevated ledge, the Ouroboros overlooked the Castle ground where the Homecoming took place earlier. 

"I can't help but wonder... Would I have been able to save you?" Noah recalled M's final smile as she disappeared. "**I wanted time to stand still... More than anything. I felt completely powerless, I wished time would stop. If the moment could have lasted forever, we... I wished for the unthinkable. Just like N. I proved to be just like him...**"

Mio put her hands in his arms, held it up with both and looked at his bruise on his knuckles, replying, "For my part, this is all I need."

"When did... you two...?"

She nodded, recalling the first shockwave M sent at them, "It was when we first fought against M. Ever since then, M and I were swapped around."

"I see... I... honestly thought you were M, back there. You had me fooled! ...Maybe that's a bad way to put it. In any case, I didn't realize at all."

"I did try my best. I couldn't afford to fail. If anyone suspected me, you'd have all been executed on the spot. _But her feelings..._ I couldn't simply let them go to waste."

"M's... feelings...?"

She nodded and shared, "She wanted to give you everything that she knew about N, to help us escape... to break this never-ending Moebius curse..." She looked up at the sky, as if to reminisce, "**_To lose, and lose, and still stand back up, even in the depths of despair..._** She wanted you to have the strength to defeat those at the root of that despair."

"She sure had a lot of faith in me. Uhh..."

"**She believed, that if anyone in the world could make it possible, it would be you. That's why... she merged our wills so we could act, to further our goal.**" The words that she spoke to Noah while she was imprisoned...

> "To live, and learn... a whole lot more... Noah..."

The smile that she had back there before her disappearance...

> "It's been fun, Noah!"

"Earlier, you said 'it was fun'... But it wasn't you, it was M..."

"I really think she meant it. It was brief, but... Being who I am now... **Passing my thoughts along**, on to you, **and receiving yours in turn...** She was... _grateful_..."

His iris dimmed a little, "_I see..._"

"From that moment, M's words were my words, and my words were now hers. Her life was scattered on the breeze, but her memories, and her will, live on inside my heart..." Her iris activated the half-moebius half-Ouroboros symbol for a brief moment. Then, inviting Noah, "**Come. I have something to show you.**" She immediately took steps forward and the others followed thereafter.

On their way down, they met Ghondor, whom asked, "Where are you going?"

Mio: "Just over there, to Hope's Rest. I'll be back soon. The other 'me' had something she wanted Noah to see."

"He's gonna see **that**?" After thinking for a moment, "Yeah, I'm coming too."

"What?"

"Come on. Let's go. Hope's Rest is a summer stroll from here. Just get off the transport Levnis, saunter out of the west gate... then keep going till you see the hill with a sea view. Easy-peasy, eh?"

"Yes." Turning to Noah, "OK, let's go!" Together, they leave for the Castle main gate. 

---

The group (with Ghondor, but not Oggy nor Aggy) arrived at a protruded platform that overlooked the sea below. Looking down, the group saw remnants of some rusty structure, mostly sunk into the sea, while some parts still stuck out of the waters, creating little island. 

Noah questioned, "Here?"

"M was still unsure to the very last... whether to show you the memory of this place. But... I think it would be best. This place... It was everything to N."

"W-What do you mean...?"

"Well, you see... This is where the City once stood."

"**It did?!**"

"It was long ago. The City back then, it was much more prosperous than now. It positively teemed with people."

Taion hypothesized, "So then, it must've drawn Moebius's ire even more than now?" To which she nodded in return. 

#### Start of Memories

A person laying on a platform; a beam of light shone on him/her. Noah jumped up with eyes wide opened; it was Mio laying on the platform. 

Z: "There it lies before you... Your heart's desire. There is no life within. You must **breathe it into her** _yourself_." He spoke something muted to us that shocked Noah; he gasped! 

"**Life from the people of the City...?!!! YOU WANT ME TO END EVERY ONE OF THEM?!!!**"

"Why the hesitation? Existing in 'this place' is by itself a result of your own choices. You are the one who chose the 'endless now', _are you not_? Your response should already be predetermined."

Noah turned his attention to Mio lifeless body. He turned to Z, which he looked back at him emotionless. "_Such a shame..._" He had to force Noah. With both eyes glowed Moebius, Mio's started to turn into blue motes, disappearing toe to head. 

He started to panic, "Ah! **WAIT!!! PLEASE!!!**" As he held his hands out, he recalled M who stood at the end of the junction waiting to walk the road with him in the cinematic scene, the steps he chose toward that junction without thinking of the other for a second. 

---

N approached the City. They watched his arrival. 

> Mio's narrative: "The City's inhabitants were the descendants of M, N, and others who became Ouroboros in the past."

N pulled out his sword. 

> "In exchange for the lease on life they would get as Moebius, Z ordered N to kill the City's people."

Flames raged the City. No one was alive. 

M was now revived. She walked and stood beside the 'emotionless'{{footnote: at least he maintained his posture outward.}} N, watching the raging flames, in desolation, "Oh no... **Tell me! TELL ME WHY!!!**"

"I didn't... want to lose any more."

"**What do you mean, 'any more'?! EVERYTHING WE HELD DEAR IS GONE! YOU TOOK THEM ALL AWAY, AND YOU DARE TALK ABOUT YOUR FEELINGS OF LOSS?!!!**"

He slowly looked towards Mio, emotionlessly replied, "Now you... will continue to exist as Moebius. The same... as myself."

"Huh..." She don't know him anymore. "**So you did it. Sealed our fate...**" With tears in her eyes, "Now we can live forever. **But this future's been stamped out before its time.** And... **_I can't even disappear._**"

#### End of Memories

Noah looked at his own hands, imagining as if he had killed the City people himself. Then, clenching them into fists, "Only two things were important to him... Impossible... **How could one every choose between them? Surely he couldn't... do it...**"

"And yet... he did make a choice." The moment he'd chose to walk on that junction; that's a choice already decided on. "No one can truly judge him, for the things he did." Mio recalled how he gave his last advice to his son before he disappeared. 

"Repentance."

"Mhm..."

"**The intentions they left behind...** They turned into us..."

"Mhm... Of course it's heartbreaking, but..."

"But still, she was smiling..."

"**We have to change things.**"

"Yeah. And this time, we'll succeed." Turning to the others, "So it's set. **Our new goal.** Agreed?"

Taion: "Yes... He can't get away with this."

Lanz: "I'm not feeling... very forgiving, either."

Eunie: "But guys... now we know there's an even bigger bad behind that snuffer."

Sena: "Z... Making someone choose the impossible...? **It's so cruel!**"

Noah agreed with her. Turning to Mio, she nodded back to him. And so he announced, "**Thanks, everyone.**"

Just then, Ghondor appeared out of nowhere.{{footnote: She said she'd come with them, but she was no where seen after they'd arrived and Mio started her story.}} "Looks like yer minds're made up." She picked out something from her pocket and tossed it at them, "'Ere, this is yours."

Mio caught it in her hands; the Cloud Keep key. 

"**By the by... Who is that Z sleazebag?**"

"He's something like the head of all Moebius. Or so it seemed... I've only met him in... the memories that M showed me, though... We now know his power is vast, far greater than any of the others in Moebius."

"Damn, so he's..."

Mio acknowledged, "Yes. He... is our true adversary. The one who formed... the world we know." Recalling Noah's first time meeting Guernica, 

> "Just who decided that this... was how it should be? **If I knew who they were, or where, I'd...**"

---

In the cinema, Z perhaps had watched what they were doing all along, emotionless. 

---

Ghondor: "Before we blast Z to his just deserts, first we have to find the Queen of Agnus, right?"

Noah: "Right."

Mio: "But I'm not sure right now is-" She turned to look around her friends. 

Lanz: "What's this, you worried about us?"

"I mean... You were all locked in a prison cell for all that time... And you're still hurt from the fight with N..."

Eunie: "Oh whatever, all we need is a bit of exercise and a stretch. Get that good blood pumping."

Ghondor, "Oh yeah? Well, am I ever pleased to hear that. If you can move, then help clean up the square you went mental on."

Noah agreed with the chore she handed them, "Ah, yes, we probably should." The rest had no objections on that.

"Then it's a deal! I'm heading back to the Castle, so get a shift on."

"OK." Noah took a final look at Hope's Rest City. The other had leave except Mio, whom called for his attention, 

"...Noah?"

He turned to her, "Let's go." They dropped behind the others therefore. 

---

Back at the Castle ground. Ghondor was speaking with some Lost Numbers, with Aggy and Oggy becoming her sidekicks again. After the instruction given, she walked towards one side. 

On the other side, Lanz and Sena were seen tossing around scrap levnises, while Riku examining it (perhaps for useful parts?). On the other side, Mio was looking after the injured Agnian, Manana approaching her, and Noah speaking to a Lost Number behind Mio. Finishing his words, Noah walked off in another direction. Taion was seen examining another junk levnis by himself. As he stood up, he announced, "Ahh..."

"Feels like we have one less worry now, eh?" He turned and saw Eunie approaching. 

"Agreed... They should be able to start on repairs now."

"Not what I meant, though... I meant this whole thing." She pointed to her neck{{footnote: If you don't already know, that's where Mio's term symbol was.}}. 

"Mio, that's right... At that moment, everything just felt so utterly hopeless that it hurt. There wasn't a thing I could do."

Cheerily, "But it still worked out, right?"

"Heh... Thanks to all of you being there."

In a teasing elongated tone, "**Ahhhhhh!!**"

"**What?**"

"Surprised you didn't choke on those words."

"Well, of course not! I can express _some_ emotions."

"Tuh huh!" 

He looked up at the sky, reminiscing quietly, "_There has to be... a reason we met... hmm?_"

"Say what?"

"It's something that Noah said once."

"And you found a reason?" He nodded back. 

"We've seen one wish granted..."

"True."

"Still, we've got a way to go. This isn't nearly the end."

"_No rest... for Ouroboros._"

"At least we've won ourselves an extension."

She was too lazy to think of the twist and turn. "Ahhhh, **it'll work out somehow.**"

"Eunie, am I sensing a streak of optimism? I thought you were one to worry about the details a bit more."

"_Now I've got a reliable guy... to stand by me, so._"

His eyebrow raised as he stuttered, "**Oh!** Wh-wha...? And who... m-might that be, then?"

"**Ehehehehe**.... That'll be my secret." And she just walked away, leaving him in solitary watching her walking into the distance. 

---

Evening. Lanz stretches a bit and exclaimed, "Phew! All done and dusted!"

Ghondor approached the group and upvoted, "Good work, team."

Sena: "All squeaky clean!"

Taion turned towards the Great Sword, asked, "We leave tomorrow, correct?"

Eunie: "Yeah, so let's take it easy for the rest of today."

Riku don't agree, "Meh, but where can it be easily taken?"

Ghondor: "Good question, the Castle's swarming with Agnus soldiers and Lost Numbers. If you aren't fussed about fancy bedding, there's a guard station in that building you can lie down in." She pointed to a direction in the same direction as where their prison were. 

Scratching his head, Riku could only appreciate, "Is better than cage cell."
