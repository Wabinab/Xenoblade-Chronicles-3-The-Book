# Ribbi Flats, Valdi, 

> **Writer's note on environment:** By a riverside, some fluffy animals called "kapiba" could be seen, with yellow furs and poop-brown head, short horns, occpying a rocky river bank. Further ahead, green and brown grass carpeted the uneven surface. A triceraptor-like creature lurked in the distance. Trees that shoot up like pine were occasionally seen. Beyond, we could see tall mountaineous regions, sometimes screwlike, other times nail-like. Taos appeared in the distance. Another scene, water falls from a huge circular-ish hole down to a river below. The bank roofed by the water-falling platform looked sandy-white, while the opposite side of the bank, yellow-back green brogs made it their home, together with some trees. Yet another scene. Cloud lurks below the edge of the ground towards infinity. Triceraptor-like creatures occupied the platform. At a distance, we could see a tall cylindrical rock like an island on clouds with some unknown creatures{{footnote: This could only be seen on the morning scene, second video.}}. A Taos flew above the clouds. In the background, some snowy peaks hid behind thin clouds. It was the monster-shaped snowy mountain that got its body destroyed by an annihilation event we seen earlier. Despite being flat, this area had lots of staircased platforms, layer by layer. This, is **Ribbi Flats**, of Fornis Region.

The group were walking up some rocky slope by a body of water to their right when Eunie called out, "Hey! Over there!" At the top of the slope was a tree. She turned to face the group, "If we set up camp there, we'll have good visibility. Think it's time we took a break?" 

"Riku, for one, want to rest, anyway! Relentless walking has left legs like numbed-out sausages..." 

Manana, triggered by food, waved her wings, "Sausages indeed! Mealtime is here!"

Mio: "Sounds good." Turning to Eunie, "Let's go for it, I say. Should we rest in shifts? I can take sentry duty first."

"Ah, Mimi! Let me back you up on that!"

Noah nodded, "OK! Then let's take a break there." 

---

Night time. 

To the right of the path was the tree, a big rock stood beside the tree. The groups, seated in two, formed a diamond. Assuming the tree as the "top" of a diamond, Noah and Riku were on the "right edge" of the diamond, with Riku showing Noah something circular while he listened to him. Taion and Manana, him sitting by a table with his teapot and teacup, and Manana stood on top of a box with her tea served, talking to Taion. They were on the "left edge" of the diamond. Eunie and Lanz, perpedicular to each other, slept with their back on the tree trunk. A waterfall could be seen in the distance, beyond the road. Mio and Sena were looking in their direction, their back facing some laddered ledge, totalled probably a few meters high. Their emotions seemed neutral to one. 

Further "right" of the diamond were ledge that seems to fall down to infinity, just empty space. Further, some taller ledges could be seen. 

Perhaps something came into her mind, Sena sorrowly commented suddenly, "Meanies..."

"What was that, Sena?"

"It's just, I was up all night thinking. Those guys are so selfish."

Mio didn't get it, "Selfish how...?"

"You know what I mean! Every time we Interlink, they're the ones taking the lead! And me? All I do is watch..."

"Ohh, that's what you mean."

"Tell me you don't think so too?"

"Maybe not 'selfish', but like... 'Hey, why didn't you move that way?!', and stuff like that, yeah..."

"Yeah, right?!"

"So, you'd prefer to take the reins?"

Sena looked down, "I just wanna do more! Like, pull my weight... Y'know?" 

Mio laughed at her, "Hahah, that's so you, Sena." She turned to look towards Noah and Riku, shared, "I think it's probably fine, though. They're just being protective, I think." 

Sena looked at her, "Like what Noah said? Yeah.{{footnote: One can't be sure whether she answered her own question or...}}"

"I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure we'll get our turn." Noah was tuned in on Riku he didn't see her glancing at him. 

"You sure?" 

She turned to her and affirmed, "Yeah. Positive." They looked off in Eunie's direction, enjoying the moments of tranquility.

By a watering hole, water fall from a platform that stretched far from a cliff wall. Sena was looking up towards their destination, with a trembling voice, "Probably shouldn't be climbing up this one, huh..."

Taion: "But, this is the route Ethel told us to take, no question."

Mio: "Well, I guess that means... We'll just, uh... have to keep going then." Where the group stood, tall grass grows as high as their ankle, and some patches of dark pink flowers in rarer view. 

From the very top looking down, the person are no larger than a dot on a paper. A male soldier with probably lemon grass colored hair, strapped a barrel-like backpack on his back, skin of assorted colors, looking downwards. 

As he stood up, someone ping him on his iris, "_Hey, **Valdi**? Where are you?_"

"Huh? Outside the colony."

"_Well yeah, I know that! It's bad. The Consul's searching for you._"

"Gotcha! Just make up something." His right hand is maybe a bionic arm, but may also be fitted with a metal glove that strapped up to his elbow, the strap so huge it looked abnormal for his size, and the fingers too! His term symbol still have the central and the left line plus diamond red. 

"_Sorry? 'Make up'?!_" From the front, we could see he wore a button on a forehead patch 2x to 3x the size of an eyepatch that fits him. From behind, two levnises came up, perhaps under his control: one for the wheel model Kevesi levnis, another with the four-legged model Kevesi levnis.{{footnote: If you remember in Chapter 1, before Eunie and the others took off, there are 2 types of Kevesi levnis, and there are also 2 types of Agnian levnis that joined the battle; at least, one only spotted these 2 types so far.}}

Back to the bottom, Noah signaled to the group, "Let's look for a place we can climb from. I'll take a look around here."

Eunie: "OK. I'll check out over here." All of them spread out in different directions individually. As Eunie was strodding slowly towards a cliff wall, Thud! The four-legged levnis landed in front of her, sending dirt blanketing her direction. 

"Oh, crap."{{footnote: Surprisingly, Eunie didn't jump backwards nor drawing her weapons unconsciously.}} She immediately turned and ran with her back facing the levnis. Manana felt the ground trembling, noticing something's not right, turned to her back and ran. The wheeled levnis was going after her. 

Noah, from the distance, saw the group in danger, shouted, "Guys, get back!" The other people ran towards Eunie and Manana, intercepting them, after which they faced the two levnises. Valdi stood on top of one of his levnis, shouted to the group, frivolously{{footnote: Google Translate doesn't translate "中二", which is what describes his behavior right now; basically, it means a person whom read too much Chinese novels and cannot distinguish between living inside a novel or living outside the novel, so whatever they read inside the novel they brought it outside of the novel; similarly, those whom watched anime like Naruto etc. will also move around and not just dressed up like a Naruto, but also behave like Naruto.}}, "Ouroboros! Fight me!" He drew out his weapon, a lance-like gun. 

Manana don't think the situation as dangerous, ran up in front of him and complained, "That was close call! Almost flattened like buttery pancake!"

Valdi looked at the nopon for a while before apologizing, "Ah, sorry."

"Apology grudgingly accepted." The others in the group, in their defensive stance but without weapon drawn, was assessing the situation, floundered. 

Valdi asked Manana politely, "Hey... Are you Ouroboros too?"

"Factually untrue. Manana is just Manana."

"Ahh, that's a relief! I really didn't want to have to fight a Nopon. Oh... Valdi, by the way. If I may?"

"Mmeh? Is pleasu-"

Taion couldn't stand it anymore, his Mondo swept past Manana towards Valdi while shouting at them, "What are you guys doing?!"

Lanz didn't waste the chance either, his broadsword bashed at one leg of the levnis. Valdi dodged Taion's attack and jumped down, landed on the ground, enjoying himself, "Woohoohoo! That was awesome!"

Lanz: "We're the ones you've got beef with. Come on, bring it!" The others drew their blade. 

Valdi walked in front of his levnises, laughed at them, "Hehe... You can't beat me. Here i come!"

---

(After the battle)

Valdi was assessing the damage done to his levnises, exthused, "Whoa. The joints are all burned out... And the state of this armor." Then, turning to the group, "Hey, show me that again!"

Lanz was out of sync with him, "Show you what?" In the distance, we could see some deer-like animal. Further, trees, fan-like leaves with reddish tips, or green pine-like trees. There was also some relatively narrow slopes that curved around the mountain body. 

"Those moves you pulled! I've never seen anyone smash up a Levnis like that! I need to figure out how you guys managed to do it."

Riku disagreed with him, "Nothing to observe. Frame was structurally poor. Evident that driving wheel could not withstand torque."

"The driving wheel, you say..." Turning to assess the wheel and producing hypothesis, "I wonder if it's because it was upgraded from lightweight to a more heavy assault style? Did I mess up the handling? But the armor had to withstand a charge, I had to fudge the weight to keep a good turning circle..."

Riku watched him talking to himself, speechless... Valdi turned to face him after a while, "Yes... You're absolutely right! I can't believe you could tell with just one look! Hey, would you teach me everything you know?"

"Noah..."

"Uh... Who exactly are you?"

"Oh, I'm Valdi. Levnis builder from Colony 30! I heard that anyone who defeats you gets a whole buttload of supplies from the Castle as a reward... But err yeah{{footnote: This had been fitted to the voice than the wordings.}}, you won, so it's all good." 

Lanz was still pissed off, snapped at him "Oh, yeah, everything's just hunky-dory! What the snuff are you playing at?!"

To which he patiently replied, "Not playing anything!"

Noah: "You're really a mechanic? From Colony 30? Who's the commander for that one again?"

"Ohhh, yeah, that would be me."

The group were surprised. Lanz: "Pull the other one!" 

"Woooo{{footnote: Blowing wind without making sound from your throat box out of your mouth}} wow, don't look so surprised!" 

Taion: "I did hear that Colony 30's commander was the greatest mechanic in Keves..."

"Not sure I would say _'greatest'_, but I am bonkers about Levnises!"

As they spoke, **Yuzet** was ringing his iris, shouted to him, "_Valdi!_"

He turned aside for a while to answer the call, "Hey, Yuzet! What's up?"

"_Surely that's my line?! The Levnis signal just cut out... What happened?!_"

"Oh, it just got a bit bashed about. Everything's fine. I'll be back home soon." Then, he cut the line thereafter. 

Sena asked, curiously, "You're going back alone?"

"Huh?"

"I... I was just wondering how you expect to manage that."

"Oh! Oh, it's fine. The Colony's not that far away. I'll just cannibalize these bits and pieces into a new Levnis, quick as you like."

Mio: "That'd take so much salvaging..."

"Oh, huh." After estimating for a while, shook his head, "...Ahahah, maybe I can't do it alone...?" The group just shrugged. 

Noah commented, sighed, "...How did I know it would come to this?"

Lanz refusingly agreed to help, putting his hands by the back of his head, "Ehhh... Guess we'll do your grunt work. All right, hit us. What's the shopping list?"

"You'd really help me?!"

"Well, we're not gonna leave you alone to fend for yourself..."

"Thank you so much, large man!" 

"Lanz, man... I mean, Lanz."

"Then Lanz I shall call you! Let's get cracking! I'll send the likeliest sites for debris to your Iris."

---

(Arriving at one of the site)

The group was standing by a grassy location, below a tree. Valdi was a distance in front of them. Valdi: "Yeah... This is looking good." Then, with a unsatisfied mode, "But man, even so... Seeing all this Levnis wreckage..." There was a broken pile of levnis on the grassy floor in front of him. 

Mio can sympathize, "That's how battle always feels after. Just sad."

"Yeah, pretty tragic. Makes me wanna fix 'em all right back up."

Lanz can't continue listening, "Look here, you..."

Valdi turned to face them, continuing, "Listen... I had this injury once. It really did a number on me, physically and mentally. That's when my masterpon told me-"

Lanz interrupted, "Wait, _'masterpon'_?"

"Oh, it's Nopon for 'really great person'! So anyway, my masterpon told me this: **_'Be a friend to all, and an enemy of none.'_**{{footnote: Writer don't know if one agree with this or not without thinking it thoroughly. May come back to it.}}"

Sena, trying to figure out the meaning behind, "Be a friend to all...?"

"Yyyeah. I guess after that... seeing wrecked Levnises got me thinking about stuff. A little elbow grease and I could just get them back on their feet. My pals here wouldn't want me to give up on them either."

Mio commented, "You're very sweet."

He shook his head, "Ahhh, don't get me wrong. It's just that, as a mechanic, you can't start getting moody just because something's broken. **_'Not all wars are fought on the battlefield'_**{{footnote: Logically speaking, that's correct. One is speechless.}}, right?"

Riku changed the topic a little, "That gauntlet... Valdi built it by self?" He was referring to his right hand huge metal arm and fingers. As an extra, Valdi had something strapped on his waist and a cylindrical object the same side as the gauntlet, which one isn't sure what it's for.

"This? My masterpon gave this to me. To celebrate my recovery!" Then he continued, "Caught your eye, has it? You wanna see more?"

Riku denied his offer, "No... No special interest."

Tucking his hands on his waist, "C'mon, don't be shy now!"

"Riku is not shy!"

Lanz: "What I'm getting from all this is that you really like this 'masterpon' of yours, huh."

"Yeah. He was really harsh on me sometimes, but he was ten times the mechanic I could ever be!" 

Manana wondered, "If compare masterpon and Riku, who is most excellent?"

Valdi couldn't decide, "Hm, good question. I... I think that your friend here has a keen eye. You know, I would love to get to speak with him..."

"Secrets of Riku are closely guarded."

"You don't say! I can't wait!"

"... Friend even listening to Riku?"
