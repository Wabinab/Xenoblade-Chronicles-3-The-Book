# Ribbi Flats, Valdi, 

===

> **Writer's note on environment:** By a riverside, some fluffy animals called "kapiba" could be seen, with yellow furs and poop-brown head, short horns. The river banks were rocky. Further, green and brown grass carpeted the uneven surface. A triceraptor-like creature lurked in the distance. Trees that shoot up like pine were occasional. Beyond, we could see tall mountaineous regions, sometimes arranged in steps around, other times clearly unclimbable. Taos appeared in the distance. Another scene, water falls from a huge circular-ish whole down to a river below. The bank that's roofed by the rocks from above looked sandy-white, while the opposite side, yellow-back green brogs made it their home. Some trees grew on the same side. Yet another scene. At an edge where it seems the platform falls down into infinity, clouds below. Triceraptor-like creatures made it their home, lurking on the platform. At a distance, we could see a rock like an island on clouds with some unknown creatures{{footnote: This could only be seen on the morning scene, second video.}}, it's unsure whether we could travel there or not. A Taos flew from afar. In the background, some snowy peaks hid behind thin clouds. It was the monster-shaped snowy mountain that got its body destroyed by an annihilation event we seen earlier. This, is **Ribbi Flats**, of Fornis Region.

The group were walking up some rocky floor with a body of water to their right, the road sloped upwards as Eunie called out, "Hey! Over there!" She turned to the group, "If we set up camp there, we'll have good visibility. Think it's time we took a break?" 

"Riku, for one, want to rest, anyway! Relentless walking has left legs like numbed-out sausages..." 

Manana was triggered, waving her wings, "Sausages indeed! Mealtime is here!"

Mio: "Sounds good." Turning to Eunie, "Let's go for it, I say. Should we rest in shifts? I can take sentry duty first."

"Ah, Mimi! Let me back you up on that!"

Noah nodded, "OK! Then let's take a break there."

As the group rested themselves by the tree with some rocks beside it, they gathered in groups of two: Lanz and Eunie were sleeping under the tree, their backs on the tree; Noah and Riku were speaking at a distance, Riku showing Noah something; Taion and Manana were enjoying tea by the table with his teapot on it, chatting; Mio and Sena sat further away, near an edge about 3 meters tall (on its shortest point). Their position formed a diamond shape. In the distance, we could see a waterfall when looking at Eunie and Lanz across the path. 

Sena commented sorrowly out of a sudden, "Meanies..."

"What was that, Sena?"

"It's just, I was up all night thinking. Those guys are so selfish."

Mio didn't get it, "Selfish how...?"

"You know what I mean! Every time we Interlink, they're the ones taking the lead! And me? All I do is watch..."

"Ohh, that's what you mean."

"Tell me you don't think so too?"

"Maybe not 'selfish', but like... 'Hey, why didn't you move that way?!', and stuff like that, yeah..."

"Yeah, right?!"

"So, you'd prefer to take the reins?"

Sena looked down, "I just wanna do more! Like, pull my weight... Y'know?" 

Mio laughed at her, "Hahah, that's so you, Sena." Looking up at Noah and Riku, "I think it's probably fine, though. They're just being protective, I think." 

Sena looked at her, "Like what Noah said? Yeah.{{footnote: One can't be sure whether she answered her own question or...}}"

As she focused on him listening to Riku, "I wouldn't worry about it. I'm sure we'll get our turn."

"You sure?" 

She turned to her and affirmed, "Yeah. Positive."
