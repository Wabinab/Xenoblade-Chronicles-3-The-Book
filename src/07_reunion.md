# Hunted Down, Reunion

===

As they walked back via the valley, Riku exclaimed: "Ahhh (yawning)... Riku so sleepy... Could do with long soak in bath." 

Eunie teased, "Oh, to be a carefree Nopon." 

Lanz encouraged, "Just hold out a little longer. We'll be back soo-... Oh!" His face turned into a smile. In the distance, Kevesi soldiers with red irises marching towards them. "Look, friendlies! Hey! It's me! Lanz from-" 

Suddenly, a bullet flew past a head. He would have died if he hadn't dodged as fast as his battle instinct brought him. Numerous soldiers on the front row took out their guns and firing at him relentlessly. They quickly ran behind a tall wall protruded from the cliff. Soldiers second row and beyond summoned their blades. 

Lanz can't believe his eyes, shouted to them from behind their cover, "Cut it out! We're your friends here! From Colony 9!" A bullet shot some rocks out near his face. 

Eunie: "They're not listening, Lanz!" 

Lanz spit out angrily: "The spark? Don't they recognize us?... Noah, erm..."

As they marched forward, Noah only had limited time to think. The first row stopped shooting, stopped in their position. The second row walked past with their blades, towards them. Seeing it's no time left, Lanz raised his voice, "Noah!" 

Noah looked at him, "We'll just have to fight back!" 

At an even higher tone: "Fight back? You crazy?!" 

"Just... don't kill them." Then, he walked out of the cover. Lanz and Eunie followed, Eunie: "Oh, is that all?!" 

Riku too: "Easier said than done." 

Noah: "Whine later... It's time!" 

---

As the last melee soldier fell to the ground, the soldiers from the distance continued their shooting at their direction. Lanz raised the shield, confused, "Crap, what is going on?! We're on the same side!" 

Eunie: "They keep coming, Noah!" More melee soldiers were seen approaching, as the group quickly ducked behind their covers, the same location just now. 

Noah recalled what the moebius had said to them earlier, "And now, the whole world will be your enemy. I wonder how your lives will turn out. I'll enjoy watching you." 

"The world our... enemy...?" Now, he realized what he meant. 

Not Eunie though, "Huh? What was that?" 

"If we get any closer to Colony 9, we're just going to end up getting surrounded. We've no choice. We're gonna have to head back!" The others nodded at him. As the guns blared behind their backs, they ran into the distance. 

---

Meanwhile, Mio and the others were in similar situations, chased by blaring bullets. Soldiers from her colony also had their iris red, clearly controlled by Moebius. As they turned behind cliff wall, Sena asked, "How are they so good at finding us?!" 

Mio was confused, either{{footnote: The intelligent guy to make decision isn't her but Taion}}, "What's going on here? Taion?" 

"I..." As the soldiers approached, he could saw the red glowing in their eyes, their face without emotions, "That light... Is that...?!" 

"What is it?" 

"I'll explain later. Right now, we need to focus on getting out of here." The others agreed. Then, they ran off into the distance.

> **Author's note  on environment:** Where they battled just now, red grass, low undergrowth with red leaves, a waterfall, cliffs surrounding the area, volffs, eagles with 4 wings (two above the other two), trees with silver leaves, but so few leaves it almost looked like none, deers, is called **Melnath's Shoulder**, located in the Aetia Region. 

---

As Mio's team entered Melnath's shoulders, an agnian soldier got in front of them. She stopped in her path, "Oh no! Guess they knew we'd come here..." 

The Gamma{{footnote: "Gamma" means "Colony Gamma".}} Soldier: "You're the ones that raided the Colony! I ain't lettin' you get away!" He drew his halberd and pointed towards them. 

The pink nopon, **Manana**, exclaimed, "Oh! Someone having real bad mood..." 

Sena: "But why...? It's like nobody recognizes us..." 

Taion: "As of this moment, the point is moot. Clearly, we ought to prioritize our physical safety." 

"But..." 

"Sena! Come on. You don't want to get slaughtered by our allies, do you...?" 

Mio: "I don't get it at all... But we can't go back to Colony Gamma with things like this. Taion. Is there somewhere we can hide out?" 

Taion: "I suppose where we bade farewell to our new 'friends' might do." 

"Understood. Let's try to slow him down at most." 

"Exactly my thoughts." 

Sena's emotion: "(sob)". 

---

Where Guernica's ship had fallen, Eunie lad her back by a box. Riku and Lanz talking to each other. Noah sitting on top of one of the boxes. Mio and her team seen walking towards them, when she stopped, shocked that they were here, too. 

"Huh?" Noah raised his head. 

"What?" Sena was shocked. 

Lanz: "You lot..." 

Noah and Mio exchanged eye contact quietly. 

The morning sun shines bright, illuminating the valley. The clouds skirted the top of the hills. A day passed, and it turned night.{{footnote: This, we used the 2nd video described in the prologue's notes. Because time is changeable in the game, the first video moved from night to day; while this we referred to switched vice versa.}}

Taion standing, Mio and Sena sitting, facing each other. Taion: "Much as I love a friendly reunion... What exactly are we doing here?" 

Lanz: "Yeah. Beats me. I'm starting to get antsy here." 

Mio: "Mmm. What he said." 

Taion: "And how do you suppose we feel?" 

Sena: "Taion, don't be like this... Reel it in a little." 

Noah was recalling what Guernica's speaking: "You guys... You wanna survive? Live on? Hold the torch?" Then, he opened his mouth, "Good question." 

Mio: "What?" 

He stood up: "Guys... Let's live. Let's survive." 

Eunie: "What kinda pep talk is that? 'Course we're gonna survive!" 

"Well then... We know where to go. The City." 

Lanz got up from the boxes he was laying his back to: "The Cit-?! What are you even..."

He turned and faced him, "In the eyes of the world at large... we're outlaws now. We can't... go back to the Colony." 

Both recalled their situations, chased down by the soldiers. Taion: "The soldiers... Their Irises glowed blood red. Just like his did." Everyone recalled the moebius's iris. 

Mio: "Right, I remember." 

"This is just conjecture, but what if... those soldiers are perceiving us as enemies?" 

"Because of the red Irises?" 

"Correct." 

Lanz rebuted, "But... what's even up with the Colony? Did that freak do that? How?" 

"We don't know the method, but it's logical to think he did something."

Noah: "That's exactly right. That's it. So, instead of going off our separate ways, we stand a better chance... if we all work together. Right?" 

"I suppose I can't deny that."

"If we are gonna be running, we might as well have some kind of aim, right? People on opposite sides, working together. Do you see?" 

Eunie asked, "You're saying we can survive that way?" Noah turned to her and nod. 

Lanz looked at Noah, "Dude... What are we doing about the Homecoming?" 

He turned and faced him, "Lanz. Are you being serious?" 

Lanz stuttered. Noah continued, "Come on. You have to understand. If you still want to go after all this, I won't stop you. But... before you do..." Noah turned and look at Mio's side, as Lanz followed his glaze, "You'll have to kill our friends here." 

Sena stood up, with Taion, got into a defensive posture. Noah then continued, "Is that even... how our lives are supposed to go?" He turned back to face Lanz. 

"Remember that ceremony, long ago?"{{footnote: He was referring to the Homecoming they saw when they were young.}} 

"But after our Homecoming, what's left?"

Lanz thrusted forward, "Think of the praise they got, up there! Up on that shining platform." 

Noah glanced down, replied, "To me, it was like a pillar of husks." 

Lanz gasped, took a step back. Noah continued, "A terrible altar... built upon countless lives... You want that as your legacy? You're really OK with that?" 

Mio eyes widened. Lanz laid back to the obstacle, hands crossed. "Well... what'd you want me to do?"

"I can't... answer that for you. I don't know everything. But we need answers. I say we go out... and find them. I want to know... Why were we entrusted with these powers? What did he mean by the 'real enemy?'" 

Mio: "So... the City?" 

He turned to look at her, nod, "Yeah."

Sena sat back down, turned her look at Mio's, "What did he say? 'A land pierced by a great sword'?"

Eunie recalled something, "Oh, right. _That_ sword. Y'know, that massive one, way down south."

We couldn't see anything against the night blanket of stars; but in the morning light, a sword seemed to made of rocks pierced in the distant background, it's features faintly seen. 

Mio recalled: "_Defeat the real enemy, and restore the world to order._" She held her hand up in agreement, "Well, then... I guess you can count me in!" 

Taion looked at her: "Mio?!" 

"I think... I'd like to trust that man. Besides, how can we even fight any more, after all we've been through?" She spoke as she lowered her hands. 

Taion disagreed, raised his voice, "They are the enemy!" 

Mio: "They _were_ the enemy." He recalled what Noah's group had done, fighting by their side, with the Moebius. He looked at the side, away from her glance. 

"OK! I'm with Mimi on this one!" Sena followed, raising her hands for a while. Both girl smiled back on him, hoped for his support. 

Taion looked away, putting his hands on his waist, stuttered, "I-it may be to our advantage. I'll admit that, at least." They looked back to Noah's group. Noah and Eunie faced Lanz. 

Lanz don't seem prepared to compromise, turned his head around, "Oi, what's that look for? Don't just stare at me. It's creepy." 

To which Noah replied, "We're gonna need an answer soon." 

"Do I even had a choice?" He tilted his head downward, closed his eyes, then raised his arm refusedly. 

Noah turned his attention to Eunie, "Guess there's nothin' for it!" She raised her hand as she replied, breezily.  

Noah nodded: "Good!" He jumped onto the obstacle where he sat before, looking at his new expanded team, to introduce himself, "My name's Noah. Colony 9, Special Forces Unit. As you know, I'm an off-seer. These three, Lanz, Eunie, and Riku, are my long-term friends. Oh, and..." He brought out his flute, looking at it while he continued, "This is my passion. Someday I'd like to play my own melodies. Not just... the same old music that I learned in training. Ok!" He tucked it backed into his pockets. 

Lanz was perplexed, got up and looked at Noah, "Uh, what is this? Feels like a surprise inspection or something..." 

Noah put his feet on the ground, "It'll help. In the long run." 

"Come on, man... Really?" 

Mio smiled. She stood up to introduce herself, "I'm called Mio. I'm an off-seer in Colony Gamma's musical unit. Erm." She scratched her head for a moment, probably boasting "I can do the hundred metri in seven seconds. Pretty quick on my toes, I guess." 

Eunie was amused: "You go, girl." 

"And... I keep a diary." She brought her diary out from her back pocket.{{footnote: Yeah, they got a secret tunnel in their back pocket that can store infinite amount of things, of any size.}} She held it with both her hands, enthusiastically sharing her interest, "I like writing down what happens. I never miss a single day!" 

Eunie got up as she introduced herself, "Eunie's the name. Special Forces Unit, Colony 9. We act as Noah's escort. Me and the boys? Inseparable since we left the pod. My special move's Group Heal. It's great at healing my allies all at once. My hobby..." She looked to the side, thought for a while, before looking back, "Collecting Fourtune Clovers, I guess." 

Sena stood up, in a lively but stuttering voice, no doubt she was shy: "And I'm Sena! I-I've been Mio's roomie, uhh... ever since I was posted to Colony Gamma!" She turned to face Mio, seeking for affirmation. As she scratched her head, "My special move... I'm just crazy strong... I guess?" Then, she bent her elbows as if to show her (invisible) biceps, "I don't look it, but I can lift far more than my own weight!" As she put it down, "My hobby is... lifting!" She ended with a jiggle. 

Eunie found Lanz a buddie: "Oh! There you go Lanz, got a muscle-buddy!" They all looked at Lanz and Taion. They weren't speaking for the moment. 

Taion looked at Mio and Sena for a moment before he sniped, "Tsk." One moment later, he compromised, raising his head at the others: "Well... I'm Taion. I'm part of Operations and Planning in Colony Gamma's survey branch. For this mission, I was assigned as support for the off-seer."

As he ended, Sena tried to encouraged him, "And...? Go on! Your special move...?"

"I don't have a special move!" The mondo{{footnote: Remember, by his left shoulder, always, in or out of battle}} flapped its wings a little, seemingly disagreed. Then, it looked at Taion, whom looked back. "Urgh... What's the point? Why share details like that? I don't have... hobbies." The mondo demonstrated a sad face, as if depressed, fell on its back towards the ground. 

Eunie smiled back at him: "Wow, Colony Dull." 

He walked up front, "Riku! In Colony 9, Riku was head of maintenance and crafting. And... these are attendants of Riku. They at your disposal."

Lanz wasn't happy, complained, "What's this 'attendants' crap?" 

She stretched her wings, jumped around, as she introduced herself, "I, Manana! Manana was cookypon in Colony of Mio and others! Manana master of food: stews, baked goods, fry-ups... Can even cook up a mean Gonzalez eyeball!" The last with stern voice. 

Eunie was yucked by her sentence, "Eyeball..." 

Sena: "I didn't realize both Agnus and Keves assign Nopon to their off-seer squads. Weird coincidence, huh?" 

Taion agreed, "Yeah. Wouldn't have expected similarities there." Meanwhile, Manana was dancing happily. 

"Hmph..." While everyone looked at him, he was extremely reluctant. Noah had to nudge, "Come on."

"Uh, my name's... Lanz. I'm from the same Colony as Noah. I work as the unit's defense. My special move... Ah, you figure it out! Urgh! Do we have to do this rubbish?" 

Noah assumed patience, "Just bear with us. We can plan, now that you've joined." 

He still can't accept their circumstances, "So you're acting like we're a team already? Urgh... sparks alive! Fine then. I'm with you."

Riku raised his wings. Eunie was shocked with his agreement, "You totally sure?!"

"What else do I do? Not like we've got much choice." Then he faced Noah, "So, what's our angle?" 

"We have made some distance, but we're still in the colony's search zone. Luckily, we don't have any colonies south of here. And you?" He prompted at the agnians, to which Mio replied,

"We shouldn't have any colonies mobilized either."

Sena: "So we... go south, then?" Meanwhile, Eunie stood up and walked towards something else further from the team. 

"Yeah!" Noah nod and agreed with Sena. Then, he turned his head to Eunie, "Um, what are you... doing there?" 

Eunie was searching out the boxes fallen out from the ship earlier. She spoke breezily: "Hm? Well our clothes..._are_ pretty filthy. Just wondered if there was anythin' to change into." As if she found something, "Oh! Fashion and utility!" She turned, with a green shirt held out, displaying it to the team. 

Sena agreed, "I need a change of clothes too." She tucked her hands to her back, embarrassed, "'Cause these are, uh... yeah." 

Noah pushed for more, "Don't stop at clothes. Have a look around. Take anything that could come in useful.
