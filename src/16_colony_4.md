# Cammuravi, Life, Helping Ethel, 

Bolearis was speaking a a guy as he looked beside him. Then, he continued a sentence with him{{footnote: Maybe something like "continue later"?}} before walking off. Noah and the others were entering the ferronis as he approached, asked, "You lot sleep all right?" The person he talked to walked off towards another direction. 

Noah: "Yeah, like a log. Thanks for the room. You cleaned it out just for us?" 

Borealis shook his head, "Nah, don't sweat it. Just a token from us higher-ups. My Iris's clock... I couldn't quite believe it." 

The scene turned to the barren desert outside, "hox" with brown manes, a horn, black fur, and a squirrel-like tail scurried around. A lake or an oasis could be seen by the distance, with a red-leaf tree grew on this side, and some taller rocks that made up walls on the other side. Grass grew sparingly amongst the sandy dirt. 

"So I went outside, hunted down a Hox as a test." 

"And?" 

He shook his head, in an exciting tone: "Didn't get snuff all. The Flame Clock didn't show, and neither did any motes." Then, he calmly spoke, "Looks like it's real." 

Noah nodded: "Yeah. We were baffled too, at first." 

"Anyway, we're all thankful to you. Flame Clocks don't work so good when you're Dirt. Hated having to worry about when my number might be up." 

Lanz instantaneously reacted, "Wait, Dirt...? I thought Ethel's rank was Silver? It was when she saved our hides, wasn't it?" 

Borealis looked for a while, then closed his eyes, "Well. Snuff happens." 

---

#### (Start of Memories)

Borealis continued to speak to the team as he recalled, "Cammuravi... Heard of him?" 

In a battleground covered by dark dirt. Nothing was growing in the area. The distant mountains enclosed the duet ground. A guy with a hand by his forehead, a short beard along his chin to his ears, having a flaming head and flaming red-painted shoulder plate, his weapon that of a broad-tipped yellow-green glowing spear. He was driving a ferronis, inside its control room. 

"Call him the 'Smoldering'." 

His ferronis, a flame clock in the middle of his chest, with some plates that stuck out of his shoulders and back, wielded a flaming spear. At the distance, we could see another Agnian ferronis not joining the fight. Levnises were seen lined up in front of the "living quarter" ferronis. 

"The greatest warrior in all of Agnus. The commander loves to spar with the guy." 

Ethel wielded another ferronis, with rings to its shouders, wielding dual sword, fighting Cammuravi. 

Mio: "I know him. They say his spear technique is unparalled; that and he's an ace Ferronis pilot. Wow... So Cammuravi and Ethel were rivals..." 

Soldiers, including Bolearis, stood straight with levnises behind them, watched the duel. 

Borealis continued, "That's right. We've fought against him who knows how many times now. Took our share of damage... But then, so did they." 

"One time, one of his Ferronis's knee joints blew clean out." Electric sparks appeared on Cammuravi's ferronis's right knee joint, causing it to fell to the ground. Ethel took the chance and slayed fragments out of Cammuravi's ferronis as it fell backwards. Cammuravi climbed out of his ferronis thereafter. 

"Ahh, most likely, it was a failure of maintenance. The commander could've ended it then and there." 

Ethel's ferronis's sword pointed at Cammuravi as he knelt{{footnote: Because he was getting up, so he knelt, of course.}} Ethel did nothing to him. They looked at each other, not moving. Ethel looked through the eyes of her ferronis. 

"But no..."

#### (End of Memories)

Ethel approached from behind him, "Telling other people's tales again? Not very endearing. Cut it out." She stopped beside Bolearis, looking at him. 

Bolearis was shocked by her appearing, shouted, "C-Commander?! A-apologies, ma'am..." 

She scoffed, "I'm joking." 

Noah prompted for a continuation, or maybe, for an explanation: "Ethel." 

Ethel continued, "It became a tremendous scandal. The Castle stripped our colony of our Silver rank, demoting us to Dirt." Then, she turned to her right, looking over Bolearis, "but look!" The other faced where she looked. 

Soldiers were meddling with the hexagonal-prism-shaped cylinder. Some soldier were soldering something. Others stood as they listened to a higher ups speaking, then did the Kevesi welcoming stance. 

"They were made the lowest of the low... and still they chose to stick by me. Even though it meant having to live day to day... That, is why I must prevail, over him."

Mio, in her **appreciation stance** (palms wraping around fist, put it to her chest, optionally looking down if she's thinking): "Huh? But you're..."

"Free from the yoke of the Flame Clock, yes certainly. However, this is another matter." She folded her hands and shook her head. 

Noah wanted something more precise: "What is it about, then?" 

"Hunger. Pride. Desire. Joy, maybe... It's a little hard to put into words... But something along those lines. I haven't all the time in the world,... and my troops understand this full well. For me..." She paused for a while, "well, all of us, really... a rematch with Cammuravi is everything. And that... will give purpose to the remainder of our lives."

Mio: "A purpose... to life..." 

As Mio was thinking and absorbing, Taion interrupted, "Right, OK... On an emotional level, I could understand."

Eunie was fascinated that a logic-head could be 'emotional', folded her hand and teased, "Wow, really?"

Taion rebuted, "I didn't say I agreed. I just see her point of view, that's all." 

Ethel: "Ahh all right now. Let's put a pin in the philosophizing." She turned to Noah, changing the topic, "When we talked last night, you said your destination was... Swordmarch, as I recall?" 

"Right." Noah nodded. 

"Come along." She and Bolearis lead the way. 

--- 

Inside the ferronis commander's room, tables arranged in a rectangular shape with 3 sides closed, the only side opened was towards the entrance. The group stood there facing the glass panes (windows). Ethel was transferring data to their iris. 

"This right here is Swordmarch." A map came onto their screen. There was a huge hole in the middle of the map, presumably not land, or maybe impassable. "Well, that part is common knowledge, I suppose." 

Ethel continued, "To get there, you have a few possible routes." Plotted on the left of the 'impassable'{{footnote: We'll assume it's impassable without special transport.}} was their current location, and they need to get to the right. "Mainly, the northern and the southern." (Both routes go around the impassable). The southern route seemed like lands, nothing too special. The northern route seemed to be joined by something "empty", and since they aren't impassable, we'll assume it's water bodies for now, maybe sea or ocean, given their wideness. 

"And then, the direct route, cutting through the ocean vortex." This directly cut through the 'impassable', the ocean vortex as they called it. 

Taion, in a shocking voice, "You don't say... That works?" 

Ethel shook her head, "Nobody's done it before."

Eunie: "Such a tease..."

Strong winds, that comparable to a giant hurricane or giant tornadoes, blew on the surface of a sea, drawing misty water vapor with it. A Kevesi ferronis is seen trying to penetrate the strong wind. "You can try to approach it from sea or from air..."

"but soon as you're close to it, you'll end up being ripped to shreds." Electric sparkles from the ferronis, itself blasting into flames, taken up into the tornado as it blasted completely. 

"Trust me, it's not just the waves and the wind. We believe there's some other force at play there. And so... Through elimination then, these two." The line that cut through the 'impassable' was erased from the map, and she continued, "and quite frankly, I wouldn't advise going north." The northern line changed from blue to red. 

Noah asked, "Why's that?" 

Ethel took her fingers off her temple, "the road's dangerous, and it runs right past Agnus Castle territory. You'd have a hard time getting through." She shook her head. 

Sena praised Taion, "Taion, turns out you were right!"

Taion pushed up his glasses as he enjoyed the vanity, "As always." 

Ethel added, "Additionally, you are Ouroboros. If you face another Colony, you may find the same thing happening as did with us."

Lanz folded his arms: "I'd feel safe betting on it."

Ethel continued, "If you go south, the battle lines are relatively fixed. If you can proceed along this route, you'll get there in about two months." 

Mio looked down, "Two months..." 

Noah sighed. 

Ethel degraded their hope even more: "But..." 

Sena: "But? There's more?" 

"Even if you reach the Sword... This... 'City', yes? It's hard to believe you would find it there. It seems far-fetched." 

Noah: "How so?" 

Ethel shared an experience, shooked her head "Once, we had to advance across this region ourselves. It was empty. Nothing but the Sword piercing the landscape. And then... There's that word you mentioned, 'City'. What could that possibly mean? Is it a person? Or a thing?" 

Eunie turned to Lanz, "When Guernica talked about it, it sounded kinda like a colony...?"

Lanz: "Uh...? I was pretty sure it was an object..." 

Ethel pressed on, "Will you still go there? Regardless?"

Noah nodded, affirmed, "Yeah... That was the idea... For a chance to live on." Mio looked at him, as well as Ethel. There was a moment of silence. 

Ethel disrupted the silence, closed her eyes, "Then there's no more to say. Bolearis!" She turned to face him, whom stood straight like a palm. 

"Ma'am!" He shouted back. 

"Our guests will be leaving soon. Let's give them any assistance we can." 

"No worries!" 

Then, she turned to the group: "Feel free to use the facilities here at your leisure. Get ready for what's ahead." 

---

In front of a canteen, Mio and Sena could be seen lining up by a canteen to take some food. A kevesi soldier before them took two rolls with mixed stuffs inside, unrecognizable to the writer, two brown buns maybe, and some tomato-colored soup, all on a tray with sections, before he walked off. Two trays could be seen put in front of Mio and Sena, the rolls weren't ready yet so they waited. Sena was looking down nervously. Soldiers like the brute guy who talked about Ardun meat to the nurse-hat stood at one leg of the tent with another female soldier, looking at them. Other soldiers seated by the table or walking in the canteen looked in their direction too. Mio was undisturbed. 

Sena turned to Mio, "Uhh, Mimi...?" 

She loudly replied without shame, "Relax. We're just doing what Ethel said. Just using the facilities at our leisure. You have to eat, else you won't grow." 

Sena eyed the soldiers from the tip of her eyes, whispered, "It's just..." 

"Don't let them get to you, yeah?" She smiled back at Sena.

"Ummm...{{footnote: On the verge of crying sound.}}"

Someone sounded from behind, "Hey." They turned. It was the third guy when they first released their flame clocks, stood beside Bolearis and behind Ethel when they first drove the fallen ferronis back to its original location. He had some weird scruffy hairs covering one side of his forehead, and his ears too. He stood behind the girls as they turned to face him.

He showed them something, to which Mio asked, "What is this?" Writer couldn't recognize the object, probably a brown hankerchief? Or some remnants of clothes? 

He continued, "It used to belong to my friend. He always wore it, till last year." Mio breathed in deeply. 

"Yes. He died. Fighting against Colony Psi. You animals killed him. Shot him right here." He pointed his index finger at Mio's glabella{{footnote: Actually, moving up the glabella, you'd find a hole. Unfortunately, one couldn't find what it's called.}}, "Clean through." He put his index finger down. 

Sena shouted back at him, "You're wrong! We're actually from Colony Gam-" 

Mio raised her hand in front of Sena to silence her. 

"Mimi, what?" 

Mio ignored Sena, looked at him as she put down her hand, "If that's what you want, go ahead and shoot. It's not like I'm a hard target." 

"Now we're talking." He looked at her term symbol, sneered, "Oh, what? You're nearly done anyway. Well then, keep your lousy embers. Die today, or in three months' time... Not much difference." Mio gasped. 

He turned his body to his side, head still on Mio, "Ah, just... mind you don't get poisoned before your time's up." They watched as he walked away. 

Sena commented, "What a jerk! So uncalled for." 

"Sena. It's fine. He was right, we did kill people. Maybe not his friend, but certainly others." They turned back to face where their food tray was. 

Sena rebuted, "We had no choice! If we hadn't've, we'd be goners." 

Mio repeated: "We had no choice... Yeah, that was clear, until now. But not any more. Right?" 

"Uh-huh!" Sena nodded. 

She turned to look at the guy, still walking in the distance, as Mio continued, "There's a chance... we can make amends. Even if we're misunderstood..." 

Suddenly, some food was put on her tray. Hearing the sound, they turned and and found extra portions piling up, like hills, which writer counted 10 of them{{footnote: Oh, boy, that soldier whom only got two...}}. "Huh?"

The person whom served them, wearing a black short chef hat, having tanner skin to both sides, split at the middle of both his eyes, red iris, smiled to the girls, "On the house. Eat your fill, friend." 

Mio: "Huh?"

"We're Dirt rank, remember? Life ain't easy here, but you did help. Besides... You gave us a choice. (pause) The choice not to fight. Now, we won't have to take others' lives. I've... I've wished for this. And you made it true. Thanks for that." He added the same mountaineous portion to Sena's tray before moving off. 

Mio saw him off, smiling. At least she had made someone's life happier, despite.

#### (Start of Ethel's Hero Quest) {{footnote: After completing this quest, Ethel could join the group, fighting as the 7th character.}}

One morning. Seated by the dining table, Lanz, at the short edge of the rectangular table, took the lead, "OK. So what now?"

Taion, to his left, analyzed the situation: "I believe the southward route is currently blocked by rockfall. I would estimate that clearing it will take some time..."

Noah, to Lanz's right, agreed: "I guess we'll just have to wait till it's done..."

Mio, sitting next to Taion: "Uh, guys. Can I say something?"

Eunie, hamburgering Riku with Noah, got into a focused position, "Huh? Sounds heavy..."

"I've been thinking and... I think there might be something else that we could try."

Taion: "You mean, about Colony 4...? It's hardly your responsibility."

"Taion, it's not quite like that... I mean, if I see someone in trouble, I just want to help them. Maybe it's not a sense of responsibility, exactly. It's more like a natural reaction."

"Oh... You feel that even for a former enemy?" 

She nodded. "That's how I feel about it... Right now, at least."

Sena, sitting next to Mio, "Mimi... Your heart's big enough for everone to have a slice."

Noah seconded Mio, "OK, well, no time like the present! Let's do something to help!" 

Lanz agreed. "Yeah, why not? Ethel helped us out way back, after all." 

Eunie, getting back to her relaxed position{{footnote: With one foot on her chair.}}: "Now we've got a chance to give something back, right?"

Taion: "... I suppose it'll help us earn their trust. And kill a bit of time, maybe."

"I... I think Mimi's right!"

"Guys... Thanks." 

Lanz, proceeding, "Right, well, that was heartwarming, to be sure. But what are we going to do the help exactly?"

"Lanz, you need to expend some mental energy on it yourself instead of blurting questions. I get this may be tricky for you."

"Oi, watch it, buddy!" Lanz snapped back at Taion. 

Noah suggested: "Well, if we're going to do that, perhaps a little intelligence-gathering is in order."

Eunie seconded, "Yeah, I guess we gotta. It's one thing to want to lend a hand, another to know where to stick it."

Mio: "I guess we'd better ask around the colony then!"

Sena looked down, "Hmm..."

Mio asked, "Still feeling weird about this?"

"N-no... It's just..."

Eunie: "What, worried about helping the bad guys? It's a bit late for that, love. Anyway, if anyone tries to stir the pot again, we'll just punt 'em under a Levnis, right?" Then, she wryly glanced sidewards, "And by _'we'_, I mean Lanz, obviously."

Before Lanz could reply, Taion interrupted, "I'd like to call ixnay on the punting, if it's not too much bother. I'm afraid it would get quite messy."

Lanz: "C'mon... It was just a figure of speech, mate." Taion tilted his head to think for a while, to no avail. 

Noah: "OK then! Everyone good to start asking round the colony to find out how we can help?"

---

(A day passed, evening. They were seating around another dining table at the canteen, after they gathered the intel.)

Noah took the head start: "All right, let's recap." 

Taion: "Injuries from local monsters, trouble owing to the Colony's location... There were also some more urgent cases, with more wounded appearing by the day."

Sena: "Yeah, the medic team seemed super busy..."

Mio: "It sounded like they couldn't provide adequate care, so they had always more patients coming in."

Lanz suggested, folded his arms, "I got the feeling they could deal with the staffing problem if they didn't also have a 'not enough stuff' problem..."

Sena: "You mean, if they had, like, drugs and bandages?"

Taion: "Those kinds of medical supplies are difficult to craft without specialized facilities."

Eunie: "Well, we're in the arse end of nowhere, and therefore bang out of luck."{{footnote: This is an unspeeched scene, so without the voice, one couldn't put emphasis or commas between sentences by one's ears.}}

Taion: "Precisely. It's only a matter of time before all the supplies start running out."

Lanz: "Spark it all. So what, we're up a creek with no paddle...?" The group breathed out the compressed air in their lungs. 

Mio: "But we have to do something...!" 

"Hmm..." Noah was thinking for a solution, eyes closed. 

Taion: "...Ah! Hang on... No, that wouldn't... Or would it...?"

Eunie got annoyed, "Taion, if you've got something to say, then do, or by the Queen's knuckles, I'll slap you."

"Yes, but... Hmm, then again..." He clearly wasn't understanding Eunie. 

Noah prompted, "What is it, Taion?"

Mio: "Did you come up with something?"

"... First of all, I have to say there's no guarantee."

Lanz: "Spit it out, man. We can work out the kinks later."

"... I hear you. Then let's leave, this instant."

Eunie didn't find that acceptable, "You wot? Oi! Where are we off to now?!" 

"Galghour's Menhir. If we're lucky, we might make it in time."

"In time for what? You're not making sense!"

"I said we have to go this instant. I'll explain when we get there."

Noah: "Eunie, drop it. Let's just do as he says." Eunie shook her head, but whatever. 

---

The group left the tables, on their way, when Bolearis ran up to them, "Hey, you lot! Got a second?" He sounded agitated. 

Noah prompted, "What's up, Bolearis?"

"It's the commander!"

Eunie: "What's the commander?"

"I haven't seen her for ages! Do you know where she is?"

Sena: "Um, I don't think we've seen her?"

"Are you sure? You haven't seen her at all? Think very carefully!" He spoke really fast and really worried. The group looked at each other, they shook their head, raised their arms, shrugged. 

Bolearis was disappointed, spitting out his thoughts, "She wouldn't hesitate to die for the colony if it came down to it! And she's so strong, that she'll bear any burden alone, however heavy! If anything were to happen to her, then Colony 4... then we'd...!"

Lanz: "OK, OK, calm down."

"Ugh... S-sorry. Got carried away."

"Yeah... Yeah, don't worry about it."

"If you see her, just tell me, OK? Sorry to have kept you."

Noah: "Y-yeah..." Then, he walked off towards the ferronis, the others towards the left facing the ferronis. 

---

(Outside, probably at Galghour's Menhir)

Noah saw Ethel outside of the colony: "Ethel?" In the distance, the ferronis was to the left. They were above a platform. 

Ethel turned to his call, "Oh, it's you..." The group approached her. 

Mio prompted, "What are you doing here?"

"That's what I was-" Ethel shook her head. 

Something caught Sena's eyes, "Wait, look over there!" 

There was a red smoke rising over the distant to their right. It came from either on the ring, or behind the ring, which is half hidden into the ground, in the distance. 

Noah: "Was that a supply drop?"

Ethel replied, "Yes. Sent from Agnus."

Noah: "How can you tell?" Behind their platform, we could now see quicksand flowing down from a higher platform. 

"We got word that an advance troop from Agnus had been seen in the area. And if they're in the middle of enemy territory, it has to be due to some kind of operation. The supply drop must be timed for the arrival of a main force." 

Taion: "Funnily enough, it's that supply drop we're after."

Noah and the others were surprised, "Did you know about the Agnian troops, Taion?"

"I've known about the presence of Agnian forces in this region for a while. I could never verify that supplies were being dropped, but I won't say I didn't suspect."

Eunie stoically replied, "Oh yeah? Well, looks like you can verify it now." 

Ethel just figured out their motives: "From the way that you're talking, it sounds as though you're after supplies too."

Noah explained, "Well, medical supplies specifically. We thought Colony 4 might need them."

"I see. Then it looks as though we happen to have the same goal."

Mio was surprised: "Really...?"

Lanz complained: "Bolearis was looking for you. You didn't actually come alone, did you?"

"Uh-huh... I actually did. Your understanding of the situation is correct." She shook her head, "and I can't risk any more casualties."

"So you thought you'd go and take care of this yourself, huh." One fun fact, a giant triceraptor-like creature lurked in the distance, before the ferronis wheel. 

Mio: "In that case, we-"

"I said I couldn't afford any more casualties, and that includes you. I appreciate that you're willing, but Colony 4 is my responsibility."

Noah reprimanded, "We want to work with you, Ethel."

"Be that as it may..."

Mio cut her off, "We've already made our minds up. That's why we're here."

Ethel still tried to convince, "You might end up having to cross swords with people from your own country.{{footnote: Do they have the idea of 'country'?}}" Noah looked at Mio. She held her hands together, palm wrapped against fist as she considered the possibility. 

She looked at Noah as he helped her redirect the question, turning back to Ethel: "Talking about avoiding casualties... You know that includes you too, Ethel, don't you?" Mio nodded in agreement. 

"Hm..." Ethel sternly looked at him, didn't reply. Noah frowned back, weren't willing to let go. 

Ethel compromised, "... I yield. I can't very well refuse you now."

Lanz affirmed, "Don't worry, Ethel. We're not who we used to be." Referring to their kids stage. 

Eunie: "Yeah, we won't drag you down."

Taion ushered, "Then if we're agreed, let's hurry and pick up those supplies."

"Apologies. And thank you all."

---

(Night fall. A group of agnians were defending those supplies. Wolves surrounded them. Dead Agnians "lives" were floating into the air.)

Lanz: "H-Hey... Something's not right."

Sena: "W-what do we do?"

TAion: "Huh?"

Noah: "No time to daydream. We have to hurry!" Ethel already summoned her blade as she rushed towards the wolves, knocking one down in the progress. 

The group caught up from behind, Noah shouting to her, "Ethel!"

"You're right, Noah. We have no time to waste... Let's rout those nuisances." They summoned their blades as the Agnian soldiers ran off to the side. The wolves now turned their attention on them. 

---

(After the fight.)

Lanz, after sheathing his blade: "Phew, glad that's over."

The rest of the group sheathed their blade too, except Ethel. Eunie: "Yeah, just one thing left." The two injured Agnian soldiers were standing between them and the supplies. 

Mio: "Ethel."

"Huh." Ethel sheathed her blade to the Agnus soldier's surprise. 

"Wh-what?"

She shouted at them: "Take your wounded and get out." A second later, she shouted to them sternly, "Leave now." They quickly ran off into the distance as she watched them off. 

She closed her eyes, directing her question, "Did I do the right thing just now... as a Kevesi commander?"

Noah reaffirmed, "There was never a reason for any of us to fight in the first place. You did the right thing, in my opinion."

She turned and faced him, "The actions you believe to be correct don't always lead to good outcomes. Some situations aren't salvageable. That's the nature of war." Then, she looked down, "It's beyond anyone's control..."

"Ethel..."

After having some time for herself, "I'm sorry. What a tedious thing to talk about." Then, she looked at the supply drop, "We'll recover the supplies and head back to Colony 4. I'm afraid I'll need you all a while longer."

---

(After they recover the supply drop, as they crossed the barricades around the colony.)

Bolearis shouted from a distance, "Commander! Commander! Commander Ethel!!!" He ran up to her and complained, "I looked for you everywhere! Where in blazes were you?!" 

Ethel patiently replied, "I went to fetch medical supplies. Distribute them to the med team." 

Bolearis unconsciously acknowledged, "Yes ma'am, I'll-" Then, he realized he almost got sidetracked, "W- ah, wait! No, Oh no, no you don't!" 

"I'm sorry for making you worry. Just, please. I did this for everyone." 

"I understand your feelings, but... Agh! Well, I suppose at least you're unharmed." 

Ethel turned to Noah's team: "That's twice you've helped me out. I owe you another one."

Lanz: "Nah, don't worry about it. We were acting of our own free will."

Ethel smiled back, "Then to reward your efforts, I'll work on getting our injured up and about again." Then, she turned to Bolearis, "Come, Bolearis." 

Bolearis did the Kevesi welcoming stance, "Uh! Coming!" Noah and the team watched as they walked off into the distance. Bolearis walked in line with Ethel than behind her this time. 

Noah called out, "Ethel."

"Hm? What's wrong, Noah?" As both turned to face him, Noah closed the distance between them. The rest of the group did _not_ followed, still standing at their original position. 

"I was thinking about what you said. **_'The actions you believe to be correct don't always lead to good outcomes.'_** "

"Mm..." 

"If someone like you says it, then I don't doubt it's probably true... But, back then. You helped us. You saved us. You risked your life. Thanks to you, we're alive right now. I can say with certainty, that's a good outcome. That's the only thing I'm certain of, actually."

"Noah, you..." She felt speechless. Lanz and Eunie came in front and stood slightly behind Noah to support him. "And we never properly thanked you." 

Lanz was reminded: "Huh, so we didn't." 

Eunie too: "Oh, yeah!" 

Together, they did the Kevesi welcoming stance, with Noah speaking, "Silvercoat Ethel, we want to formally thank you for your courage."

Ethel lowered her eyebrow, "Heh..." She and Bolearis replied back with the Kevesi welcoming stance. She admitted, "I can hardly recognize the three of you." As she turned to her back, "I'll continue to do my best to live up to my nickname." Then, she walked off into the distance as Bolearis followed. 

Mio got into her appreciation stance as she looked at the three.
