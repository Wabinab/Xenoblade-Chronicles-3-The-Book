# More About Melia

===

Inside Keves Castle's factory alleyway. The blood red sky forever illuminates the interior. The group was traversing when someone called out, "Excuse me." She just walked between them and walked past them. 

Mio: "That voice..."

Noah: "Wait... I know who you are!"

They hadn't managed to speak more when Aizel called out, "Your Majesty!" He approached with several soldiers. 

Melia shook her head and sighed, "Huh... Did it fail?"

She approached Aizel, whom spoke, "I understand... how you feel, but... you must think of your own well-being! _Please... have patience, I beg you!_"

"Surely I've been patient enough. Stuck there in Origin, it's enough to send one insane."

Mio cut into their conversation, "Um... Can we help you?"
