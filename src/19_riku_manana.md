# Riku and Manana

===

> **Translator's note on environment:** Metal pillars supported the rock above the tunnel/cave. Small animals that crawl on the floor, had some green glow on their backs (caterpillars{{footnote: One knew this later.}}), and bats with copper wings, lurked the area. Another scene. Some grass growed on a platform in the distance, with an entrance, and some krabble-like animals, which one couldn't distinguish from afar. Stingray-shaped creatures soared on the air, in the place enshrouded by clouds, with a hole where lights shone from atop, illuminating the clouds. Some jelly-like crystals hung from the top. Yet another scene. Some spider webs cobbled around some rocks, and some rusty metal fences. Final scene: unending tunnels with supports, their walls glowed with specks of blue This, is **Urayan Tunnels**, in the Pentelas Region.

#### (Start of Riku and Manana's Hero Quest){{footnote: You'll know why it's Riku _and_ Manana as you progress on with the story.}}

As the group entered the tunnel, we could see a caterpillar crawing in front of them, at the end of a slope which they were on, and there seemed like a lift in the distance that could take them down. Noah turned around to the group, warned, "We don't know what lies ahead, so let's go carefully."

Taion agreed, "Indeed. I want to be out of here as fast as possible, but haste can only spell trouble." 

Riku walked forward and scanned the area, commented, "This place rich in ore and gemstone! Speed is of essence! All treasure will belong to Riku!" 

Manana: "Oho? Riku seem mighty excitey." 

Riku turned a serious face as he turned to Manana and the other audiences, "... Gemstone have many use. They probably useful later to us."

"Riku sound unusually enthused. Took to be cool and brooding type."

Riku scratched his head with his wings, explaining, "... It something of a hobby."

"Ohhhh... hobby of Manana is cooking!" 

"Riku well aware..."

Noah asked, "Riku, if we find any nice gemstones, should we bring them to you?"

"If friends get chance, then please. Gemstone with good potential will be good investment for future."

Lanz wasn't too optimistic, "I don't think we're just gonna happen across priceless gemstones, but OK."{{footnote: If you look behind the scene with the first video, you could see a character that was never introduced. That person actually could be anybody, because in game, there's a 7th slot for a hero like Ethel or Cammuravi to join in and appear in scene, but they never spoke or do anything out of the common, so we'll omit them in the future unless they participated. And by the way, that hero was actually <a href="https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Teach" target="_blank">Teach</a>.}}

"Nopon very pacifistic and don't fight, but would hate not to lend support."

"If Manana fight, that mean Manana not become burden?"

Eunie cut in, don't see her as a burden, encouraged, "Don't you worry about things like that. Everyone has their bit to do."

"If Manana could Interlink, Manana surely to be of good use."

Riku seemed to be reminded of something, "If we could do such thing, would have done ages ago..." 

Noah cut the conversation short, "Right. Anyway, getting out of these tunnels is the main priority. But let's keep an eye out for any ore along the way. We can't afford to overlook anything that might help us later."

Riku agreed, "Understood. That good enough." 

Lanz grudgingly, lazily replied, his hands put behind his head, "Yeaaaah, go on. I'll give you a hand."

Riku was surprised. "Even Lanz? That turn up for the books..." 

"Always good to have a few favors to call in, yeah?"

"...Riku knew it."

---

(As they got up to the lift)

Sena tried to activate the button that call the lift. It turned red, failed. "Hmm, doesn't look like it's working, guys."

Riku walked forward and inspect for the cause, "It need electricity. But if no ether cylinder, no electricity."

Mio suggested, "Let's have a look around, shall we?"

Taion agreed, "That sounds like a plan."

---

(After they found the lift control room)

They were in a room with window panes in front of them, and electronic panels installed in the room. Surprisingly, it has lights inside. Noah installed an ether cylinder at the power receiver, (cave) lights around the bottom area immediately turned on. 

With the lights, we could now see metallic floor installed above rocky floors, and some ladders leading up to an elevated platform with some chests. There seemed to be wires hanging above, but translator couldn't make up what it is. The surrounding area is mostly barren: metal pillars, rocks, platforms, lights, floors, that accounted for most. 

The lift light, now turned green, they could call it. 

---

(In the control room)

Manana happily danced as they saw the elevator coming to the upper floor, where they were at, "Ohoho! It move!" 

Riku: "Now elevator behave self."

Eunie praised, "Nice job, Riku. Always good to have a grease-Nopon that knows their way around techy things."

His 'nose' stood high, "This? Piece of pollen orb{{footnote: Pollen orb was something that originated in the Nopon village. First introduced in Xenoblade Chronicles 1, it was said to have some addictive effect, like the addictive drugs we abused today.}} for Riku."

Noah: "OK, let's go."

---

(Arriving at the lift)

Some spiders, brown torso, and yellow abdomen with patches of irregularly shaped browns, dropped onto the floor. The group got into defensive posture as Lanz complained, "Gah, 'course there's monsters!" 

Taion: "Oh well, then. Nothing else for it, it seems."

Eunie agreed: "We don't have time to burn here. Let's ash 'em up, yeah?" They drew their blades as she finished. 

Manana, making her mind up, eyes shining, brought out her Wok originally on her back on her wings. It was silvery with two loop handles, its diameter slightly smaller than her torso, and there was a "cross" in the middle, made of one fork and one knife, with a circle on top of where the cross intercepted. The cross contained three diamond shape stars, like those stars inside Manana's iris. "Manana help with fighting!" 

"...Huh?" Mio was surprised as she looked to where she was. She held the pan over her head as she twisted herself, spinning in the direction of the spiders. The group watched her off. "Meeeeeeeeeh-eh-eh!" The spiders fell to the ground where she spun. 

Sena was now worried, raised her voice by an octave of two, "Manana?!"

Taion was shocked as well, "Don't be so rash-!"

"Manana did it!" She spoke as she was still spinning past the spiders. Riku closed his eyes, foreboding something. 

Mio shouted out, "Oh no! Manana, stop!" 

"Manana cannot stop pot in mid-spiiin!" 

Sena called out, "Watch out!" Then closed her eyes as she heard the wok smashed against the rocks behind. Manana laid on the floor with the wok by her side. 

The group quickly ran up to her, Mio first, "Um, Manana? Are you OK?!" She probably fainted, but the author didn't draw spinning wheels on her eyes, so maybe not? 

Sena, seemingly about to cry (in a worried voice), "Manana, please be OK!" 

As she finished, Manana's eyes opened, swooped her way up on her feet as she drew her wok concurrently, and stuffed it to her back, spoke in a serene tone, "Manana is fine! Only heart go pitter-patter."

Noah scratched his head, "Just watching you made my heart go pitter-patter."

Lanz shook his head, "Seriously, Manana, that was wild."

Mio, in her appreciation stance: "Phew... I'm glad you're safe, anyway."

As if proven herself, "See, Manana is good for many-much things beside cooking!" 

Riku disagreed with her, his wings wide opened as if trying to embrace, "Manana rush in like _crazypon_ just to prove that?!" 

Manana nodded, "Is important to demonstrate through action!" 

Riku rebuted sternly, "Manana did not just throw pot. Threw whole self along with it."

Manana turned to her back to show her pot, explaining, "Is special heavy-duty pot, also for self-defense. Exclusive Nopon brand!" 

"Th-that not a thing..." Riku was speechless... 

Mio stood in to explain for him, "Manana, you have to understand that poor Riku was worried about you!" 

Manana turned to look at Riku, trying to ascertain, "Is truth?!" 

Riku, perhaps shy, or perhaps to save face, turned to his right away from looking at her, "Not so much truth..."

"That very considerate! But Manana is really fine." 

Lanz looked at Riku, "Yeah, that's right. Worrying too much isn't good for you either." 

"Exactly. That why Riku not worry."

Eunie teased him, "Your blushy little cheeks aren't fooling anyone. Don't be ashamed!" 

He turned to Noah for final backup, "No shame here! Noah, please come to defense of Riku."

Noah laughed at his reaction, "Hehehehe, you just didn't want your friend to be hurt. Shall we leave it at that?"

"Meh." Riku could only sighed, seeing no one to back him up, drop his head. 

That did cheer up the group, and Noah cheerily turned to Manana, warning her, "But Riku's right. No more crazy antics in the name of helping each other out, OK?"

"Manana understand! Not to do crazy antic in future."

Noah nodded, and Taion concluded, "Then it's settled. Let us descend." The group took for the lift. 

---

(After walking down from the ladder leading up to the bottom of the lift.)

There was a huge rock to their right. Behind it, there was some glowing "liquid lime colored" crystal. Sena first saw it, asked out, "Huh? Is it just me or is that rock sparkling?"

That caught Riku's attention, "Hoho! Maybe is-" Before he could finish his sentence, he ran off towards it. There was a tunnel towards the left of the glowing crystal. 

As the group stopped by the crystal, Riku inspected it. The excitement, died down, "No. Just ordinary rock." 

Mio: "What about this? I can't tell them apart..."

Riku assured, "That OK! That what RIku here for!"

"It's a good thing you're with us, Riku."

"Leave to Riku! First, Riku and friends search area!" 

---

Sena: "Hey, I found one!" They stopped by another "liquid lime" crystal stuck between a rock cavity. There were darker greens that looks like liquid incorporated in it. 

Riku walk towards it, inspecting, and rejecting, "No, this not right.But is useful, so Riku take it." He scrapped a piece from the rock and kept it in his pocket. 

---

By yet another site, Eunie asked, "Isn't this one?" Still lime-colored, but seemingly glowing dimmer than the one before. 

"It look like, but is not. Observe here precisely. Intensity of luster grow dim."

Eunie squatted down to look at it, didn't see any difference, lazily replied, "OK, I believe you." 

"But it not useless! Keep hold for now." 

---

By yet another site, we could see some supporting metal beams to the left of the crystal. Taion squatted beside Riku, already losing hope on finding one, "This is... not one."

Riku: "Oho? This might be valuable at later time, so we should keep." This crystal part glowed more brighter than the others. 

"OK, got it."

---

As the group exit the tunnel into the second scene from the description at the very top of this page (the clouds, lights shone from tunnel into the cloud sea, hanging strings of crystals), Manana stopped and spoke, "Riku seem to find great joy in rocks. He pick up so many!" 

He stopped and turned around to look at her, "Gemstone and ore are different from normal rock scattered around. And ore we pick up from before have great utility." Sena and the others stopped to eavesdrop on their conversations. 

In a disappointed tone, "Manana not rock scientist..."

Sena was stoked by his hobby, "You can identify them all, Riku! You sure know a lot about rocks."

"Riku know thing or two."

Lanz didn't agree with his self-deprecation, "Don't be modest. You've got skills, mate. You should be an appraiser." 

"Cease with flattering."

Sena disagree, "It's not flattery! It's good to have a hobby!" 

"Manana in agreement!" Riku faced away from the group after he spoke. 

Teasingly sounded, Lanz: "It's pretty good that we were able to come out rock-collecting, huh, Riku?"

Riku was seriously offended, spoke in a stern voice, "Ore and gemstone! Not rock! From supply material to maintenance work, that Riku's job. It solemn responsibility to keep important equipment in tip-top order so everyone can come back alive." Then, looking sideways, "Just doing own job. Not like Lanz." 

"You what? I'm pretty much almost sort of doing it!" 

Sena was impressed, "Wow... You really give yourself a lot of responsibility, Riku."

Riku, scratching his head, put a halt to the conversation, "Too much talking. Out of Riku's character."

Noah debated, "Not at all. Understanding each other better isn't a bad thing, is it?"

Manana agreed. She walked a few steps and stoop beside Riku, to look at his eyes, "That right. Become better friends is important."

Mio: "We need to learn more about each other to become better friends, right?"

"That exactly truth. Learning about each other very important deal!" Manana backed her up. As if a light bulb came into her head, "Ah, Manana has idea! Next, Manana will show faaaavorite thing!" 

Riku was confused, "Next? It not about taking turns..."

Manana seemed not to listen, nor offended by Riku's sternness, flapping her wings as she danced up and down, "Bate breath in readiness! Manana show you her specialty! You learn soon!"

As she look into the distance, with some rock pillars that formed a semicircular shape, originally several storey tall, perhaps the side facing them had lost its building structure. Plants made it their home. A bonfire was lit in the middle of the structure. Other dilapidated remnants were seen to the right. There was also another island, joined to somewhere, perhaps top of the first structure, by a rope. On that island, some structure shaped like "top" stood on. Surrounded their current island were empty space, and the "cloud sea". 

"Over there is good place. Time for break!" 

---

As the group sat around the bonfire, Lanz appreciated, "Mmm, so tasty! Nothing like a hearty meal to keep you going for the long haul!" 

Noah nodded, "It even wakes you up somehow." 

Sena: "Endless rations{{footnote: These were the foods given to the colony, in 'rations', when the colony had lower rankings.}} are so boring. You need to spice it up like this!"

"Manana couldn't agree more!" Then, she 'logically' targeted someone, "Taion only cook tragedies, so Manana work hard to learn cooking!" 

Eunie was enthused, curious to learn more as she bent forward to keep her attention on her, "Ha! First I've heard of it. Is he that bad?"

In a very low tone, as if to remind her of something, "It very horrible."

To explain himself, his hands crossed, "Actually, my cooking just focuses more on efficient absorption of nutrients, and convenient portability. And I've actually optimized it."

Jokingly, Eunie: "...You mean it used to be even worse?"

Mio backed Taion up, sharing her thought enthusiastically, "H-hey, now, I like Taion's cooking! It's... unique!" 

Noah suggested a solution, "It's OK. Swallow it down quickly and you'll probably be fine." 

Sena was astonished. "Do you... Do you really think you're helping...?"

"Is there second helping?" Riku confusingly asked, perhaps for an extra portion?

"Oh yeah?" Lanz asked. 

"...What?"

"What's this, Riku? Your favorite food or something?"

Rejecting hypothesis to save his face, as usual, "Is not favorite. Is taste of Manana hard work, and is rude not to clean plate." 

"Actually, Manana season with frazzlefish to bring out hidden flavor. Manana pleased Riku notice!" She was touching the ends of her feathers together, like how a human would used his/her index finger, gently touching the tip of each other as one speak. 

With a more trembling voice, as if to disappoint her, "Meeeehhh... Riku not know that actually." 

Manana was surprised. "You not know? Well, Manana only happy you know now! And... Manana bring Riku whole mountain of seconds!" She immediately walked off in the distance, away from the bonfire.

Lanz: "You think he minds?"

Mio answered, "It was so good he had seconds. And Manana knows how much he liked her cooking. I don't see the problem."

Sena added, "She was so happy."

Noah praised, "I think her ability to accept people's words upfront is one of her best points." 

Mio: "Haha, maybe she's a little _too_ upfront."

Taion added, "And her air of innocence is... characteristic of Nopon." Behind, we could see some brick-red walls covered with cement-colored, cement? Low grass grew on the ground. To the right of Taion, there was a path that makes a perpendicular turn to the right. 

Eunie: "Upfront and innocent, huh..." She turned to look at Riku, as if to mean something. 

In a loud voice, "Riku is also good honest Nopon." 

"Let's not get into that..." Eunie seemed unconvinced. 

Sena: You were so serious when you were looking for the ore and gems. It's really good to be able to throw yourself into stuff like that so passionately. Like, into the things you love!" 

"Sena is good person. Is shame Lanz lacking this quality..."

"Why are you always picking on me?!" 

Noah: "Just up ahead might be Riku's treasure." Perhaps he was pointing at the ores. 

Sena, stoked, "Then let's go treasure-hunting!" 

"Yes! Riku get mighty whiff of treasure here!" 

Noah put an end on the conversation, "OK, let's have a quick breather and then start the search." Manana still hadn't come back, though...

"As Noah wish! We definitely find it!" 

---

As they entered a cave with some grass growing in a semicircle on the dry soil, Mio looked beyond the distance, some reddish ore-like structure revealed itself. Spiderwebs blocked their way in between them and the ore. "Huh? Hey isn't that...?"

They were actually stepping on spiderwebs, those behind and beside Mio. "Ohoho! Now that what Riku call a gemstone!"{{footnote: Manana is now back online!}}

"Manana will bring back!" She dashed into the distance as she finished her sentence. 

"Gemstone need careful handling. Riku will also go." She dashed and followed Manana in the direction towards the spider webs. The group strodded slowly behind them. Noah meticulously looked up, alarmed and shouted, "Wait! Riku! Manana!" 

Too late. They already arrived at the reddish ore. As they heard Noah, they turned and saw a spider with buff muscles on its cursive legs, two pair of fangs that feeds into its bat-like fae and mouth, with two bat-like ears that had lime-green liquid flowing through stretching from where the "ears" are supposingly located, and patches of glowing turquoise on its abdomen. The spider approached Riku and Manana. 

Manana: "Meh-meh-meh?!" 

Riku: "This blight on personal record..." 

Lanz shouted to them, "Wait there, we're coming!" Yet, smaller arachnids appeared behind the giant spider that block the group's way from disturbing their "mother" about to devour Riku and Manana. 

Taion: "No good, they're coming this way too!" 

Mio warned, "Drop the gem! The monsters seem to be after them!" 

Riku wasn't willing, "Meeeeeeehhhh...!" 

Manana pugnaciously disagreed, "That is precious thing! Cannot be thrown away!" 

Riku turned to Manana with a sorry look, apologized, "Sorry to bundle Manana up in recklessness of Riku. Manana must throw gemstone over that way." 

"But it your treasure, Riku!" Manana was surprised Riku willingly gave up the gemstone. 

With a shaking voice, perhaps trying to suppress the difficulty in choosing, "True... But if Manana throw, then monsters go also."

Manana encouraged, "Riku giving up too easy!" 

"Meh-meh?!" 

As if everything was under control, "This nothing-trouble! And also... Riku say he get every treasure!" 

"But Nopon not fight!" He still looked scared, down.{{footnote: Bro! The spider is really patient watching them quarrel, huh?!}}

"That irrelevant! Should become like Mio and Noah! If Riku and Manana work together, this piece of pollen orb! Riku not agree?"

"Manana..." His eyes met hers, encouraged his, "Riku agree. Riku not give up in this place!" Then, walked up to face the giant spider, "Riku here to get treasures and beat monsters!" 

Manana joined in, "Manana can be behind that!" 

"Is not yet time..." He drew out the weapon he attached to his back on his wings that shaped like a gun. 

"... for give up!" Manana finished his sentence, drew out the wok as she joined him. 

"One, two..." Riku counted, they dashed past, sending the queen arachnid into the air by dashing below it, dashed past it as it dropped to the ground, and arrived in front of Noah and the others. 

Manana, fluttering her wings, "Magnificent success!" 

Lanz was amazed, "Nice job, you two! What a team!" 

Sena, with a worried voice, "I'm so glad you made it back!" 

"Manana sorry for causing worry." She answered in a lower tone. 

As Riku and Manana turned to face the queen arachnid, now got on its feet and turning its attention towards the group, Riku commented, "Now we see real Nopon potential!" 

"That right! Maybe it impossible for one Nopon..." 

"But not for two!" 

"Together-fighting is better!" The group drew their blades and face the arachnids. 

--- 

(After the fight.)

The group stood to face Riku and Manana. Lanz was relieved, "Phew. I didn't know how that was going to end." 

Noah added, "Right? I was so surprised to see that from Riku and Manana!" We could see a tree growing in the background, by the way. They were also growing on top of a taller platform filled with spiderwebs, behind Lanz, if Riku looked up at him.  

Mio too, "I didn't know they could fight like that." 

Riku, back with his sternness, clarified, "Riku is superior Nopon! Everyone know still Nopon run deep." 

Lanz couldn't stand it, "Come off it, you aren't running anywhere." 

Sena, "But now we know you can fight with us. How reassuring is that?!" 

Manana, twinkles in her eyes, "We sorry for worry. But we learn that combine power together mean we can fight!" As she drew out the extracted magenta-ish crystal, "And that not all! We fetch back nice stash of gemstone!" 

"Thanks for doing that, guys!" 

Riku accepted it, "Yes! Getting best treasure is thanks to Riku."

Lanz, shaking his head, "Someone sounds chuffed with himself." 

Taion suggested an end to the conversation, "Looks like the danger's passed for now. Let's keep going." 

Noah agreed, "Right. We're still not out of these tunnels. Keep your guards up, everyone." 

"Manana do Manana's best!" 

Mio was enthused, "Haha, you're an asset to the team, you two!" 

Riku looked away, explained away humbly, "... Riku just doing job." Manana looked at him, silently knew he was enjoying himself.
