# Joran, Off to the Sea

(The previous hadn't edited yet. Check it out before this!)

===

The group exited Samon's engineering department into the road by some park, waiting for his completion. There were some kids gathered in the park under a tree by the grass, knelt down on the first rows and standing up with their back bent forward for those on the second row, playing something together. That caught Lanz's eyes. 

"There. All done!" One of the kids knead a puppet out of grass (or is it carved out of wood?) that signifies some warrior holding a sword. 

"Wow! Amazing!" Another exclaimed. He took it over from him and ran off in the distance with another standing kid going after him while another said to him, 

"'Kay, I'll bagsie the next one! I even brought the materials an' stuff. Make me something mega cool, yeah?" It's not just Lanz stood still, but Noah noticed him standing still, stood back and watched what he's up to. The others had entered the lodge's entrance. 

"Sure. What kinda Blade do you want? Sword? Gun?" They were discussing what next to knead, the other two kids ran around, the other after the guy holding the sword blade puppet in the park, while the last kid played herself. 

"Fist."

"Okey dokey."

Lanz, seeing them played all along, knew Noah had been beside him, "Hey."

"Mm?" He turned to look at him. 

"If we didn't have to fight each other... you think.. that could have been Joran?"

##### Start of Memories

Joran was meddling with something inside their tent himself, while the group of three went up to him, Lanz calling out, "Joran! Didja ditch training again, just to work on this stuff?"

"Did not! I'm not skiving!" He was using a carving knife to carve something. He didn't lay his eyes on them, continued with his carving even while he was explaining himself away, "I just... had a bad headache. I gave notice, too..."

Eunie couldn't believe her ears: "'Scuse me? Noah did that for you. Right?"

He just laughed it off, "Huh huh, err, I'm used to doing it."

"OK, it's done!" Joran held it out for the others to peer closer at it. 

Lanz: "Hold on! Isn't that..."

"Ahahahah..." He tucked it to the side of his belt. There was already 3 figurines hanging on it, all wearing war suits, one male with gray spiky hair, a female with short blond hair and wings on her head, and the last with dark hair and a strand of hair slicing through between his eyes, ending on the side of his nose. 

Eunie asked, "Who's that? Lanz?"

"This one's Eunie... and, this is Noah."

Eunie was impressed! "Hey! That looks just like me! Good job, matey!"

Lanz: "Huuuh...?"

Noah: "I love it, Joran!"

"Uh? Yeah...?" 

"Yeah!" He nodded with confirmation. "We don't have your talent. All we can do... is slash and shoot each other... But you create things!"

"Hahaha..." He was humble to hear it. 

Lanz broke into their conversation, asking, "Hey! So who's this?"

Joran looked down at the last figure, the one wearing red striped shirt, thick hair that covered both side of his eyes. He seemed intentionally covering it. 

"We know someone like that?" Lanz continued. 

Eunie: "Look like a real tough fella."

"Umm, that's... Err... It's me..." He felt embarrassed. 

All three in unison, "Whaaattt???!!!"

Lanz: "This _is_ you?"

Eunie: "It looks nothin' like you!"

"M...mm... Yeah... But, like... That's what I wanna end up like, someday. Haha... Silly, huh?"

Noah: "It's not silly! I believe in you. I've seen exactly what you can do!"

Lanz disagreed, "You think _he's_ got what it takes? You're talking out your bum."

"No, I'm not! He can do it! Right, Joran?"

"Uh... Uh... I'll... try, then. I'll... try really hard!" Noah nodded back at him. The others mentioned nothing to disappoint him. 

##### End of memories

Lanz, in a regretful tone, "He looked up to me, man... Smiling..."

"Sometimes it's hard to judge, huh? What we're supposed to be protecting. It all gets a bit blurry."

"Yeah..."

"Even so... His smile... was the real thing. We should cherish that."

He resignedly sighed. Then, he looked at his hand for a while, until Noah held out his fist straight to him. He turned to meet his eyes, and Noah continued, "Next time, we'll think twice. About... who really needs punching." He withdrew his fist from him. 

Lanz looked down at his fist once more, closed his eyes, agreed, "Yeah... **Yeah**... I hear you." Noah held out his fist once more; this time, Lanz punched back, and their fist met, a sign of agreement.
