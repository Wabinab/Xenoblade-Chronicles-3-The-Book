# Consul K and Silvercoat Ethel

Inside a workshop. Several Kevesi soldiers overlooking a hanging levnis with two giant copper wheel, two horns 45Â° pointing at the top, and one facing down, it's head faced down. It was hung by several threads. An faceless soldier was shouting instructions, "No, no, no! More to the right!" The threads hanging the levnis moves with it. "Right there! Start lowering!" 

The sound of engines revved as the levnis come down. Thud. Soldiers walked towards it for inspection. He shouted more commands, "Make sure it's airtight. Sand around here? Finer than Ruska flour." 

A soldier, thick hair, slightly dark skin, not wearing a helmet, suggested, "I could do a triple weld."{{footnote: A fact, his height is about the radius of the levnis' wheel.}}

"Sure. Long as the output's stable." He gave a green light before walking off.

"Yessir." 

Meanwhile, a soldier wearing a green hat like that of a nurse, thick hair covering his ears, moved towards a guy half a head taller than him, buff, his hair also thick and long. The tall guy was overlooking some hexagonal-prism-shaped metal containers. As he approached, he asked, "What's up with the K rounds? We're two caches short! Hope you didn't snuff up the order!" 

The guy turned and face him. He had two groups of hairs dangling in front of his eyes. As if being attacked, he sniped back, "I don't know, OK? Got a problem, take it up with logistics." 

The guy with the nurse hat, we could see his irises red. He stated, "We're just a Dirt-rank colony, low as they come. You think the Castle gives a crap?" He looked to the other side, slightly lowering his voice with the last sentence. 

"Queen's Oath, this pisses me off. We get better scores than any sparkin' colony out there." 

The nurse-hat whispered to him, "Did you know? For Tin-rank field rations, I hear they get Ardun meat."

"Really? And... us mudders?" He also lowered his voice to a whisper. 

"Trust me, you really don't wanna know." 

"Ahhh..." He sighed, his left arm tucked to his waist. We could see his eyebrows shaped like a glisser. He wore a heavy jacket with zips that ends around his chest, and a sweater inside. From behind, we could blurry see a woman with silver hair and silver coat, accompanied by a man, walking towards their direction. The workshop was huge, and there was a huge workshop door that linked to the outside. All we could see was yellow sky. The interior walls looked rusty. The floor were metallic. 

"I miss the good old Silver days. Didn't have to rely on rations back then. We had cooks come and serve us right on the front line. Used to get Armu sirloin, we did." 

As he spoke, other soldiers, seeing the silver-coat, her silver hair spreaded like waterfall, length to her waist, continued walking with the accompanying guys. Other soldiers bent their arms, palm facing inwards just over their shoulders, held into a fist, legs together and stood straight, stopped whatever they were doing, as she passed. They didn't notice her arrival. 

"Seriously?!" Perhaps the nurse-hat guy wasn't from their Silver rank colony before. As the woman stopped, they still hadn't noticed her. A soldier working at the levnis wheel had to signaled at them in a loud whispering tone, "Ah- Hey!" 

The buff guy turned to face him, sniped impatiently, "What now?" As he turned, his eyes glanced the silvercoat. "...Urk!" He quickly do the welcoming pose, chest forward. Here, we could see he had yellow irises. He probably felt scared or awkward, being found out complaining of their situations than getting the work done. 

The nurse-hat guy only reacted after he did the welcoming pose. He quickly face his direction, gritted his teeth as if biting his tongue, and did the same pose. 

The woman, irises mostly turquoise with some magenta, long thick forward-pointing brown eyelashes, wore metal plates at her shoulder, "My own indiscretion... has caused you difficulties. I'm sorry." 

The guy standing behind her had brown skin, wore a power suit, thick hair that curved at its edge, and no other features the author could describe other than strips of orange on his power suit. 

The nurse-hat guy anxiously blurted out, "N-no! We would never... Our apologies, Commander Ethel!" 

To which the tall guy added immediately, "That was all, uh, just banter! Believe me, we had... no intention of-"

Ethel cut her explanations short, "You enjoyed eating Armu steak, did you?" 

The guy relaxed his eyebrows, probably known Ethel for long that she won't punish him for this time, or maybe just recalling, "Uh... Yes, I did! Tastiest food I ever ate!"{{footnote: Ahem, ahem, unconscious reaction to delicious food.}}

"I liked it as well. And I hope we will have it again. So lend me your strength." She scanned the both of them. 

The nurse-hat replied, "Ma'am! Yes, ma'am!" And the tall guy nodded. 

Ethel maintained her eye contact for a second before turning and walking off, the guy followed closely behind. Their watched her leaving, fist up.

After they got out, the guy behind Ethel prompted, "I don't see what's wrong with **Volff**, personally." 

Ethel, in a light tone: "Pfft. That's because you have poor taste. I'm jealous." 

"Well, trade you my taste buds?" 

"No, thank you." The outside ground was composed of dirt, perhaps a stone or two, but nothing else except some tenacious-growing grass. She continued, jokingly, "My mouth'd turn as foul as yours." 

"Hahaha! True that." They stopped overlooking the distant. A few patches of grass could be seen growing here and there, but these are rare. There was a bonfire in the distance, to which it was sandwiched by two tall pillars of rocks slightly left to the bonfire, from Ethel's point of view. 

Looking from the side, we can see the surrounding was dusty. The flame clock levnis wheel almost occurred the whole screen. Some tall structure like watchtower stood, and barriers were lifted with door opened only at the watchtower. A tent could be seen on the left of the picture. 

Looking in front of them, we can see barracks set up behind them. The guy, hands on his waist, scanned the horizon, exclaimed, "They cleared out real fast." 

Ethel replied, "I hear the attending Consul... is a particularly punctual sort of character." 

"Please not another stickler for the rules..." 

"Can't be long now..." She slightly glanced back at him from the tip of her eyes. He crossed his hands by his chest. 

As he put them down, "Yeah... Got about five minutes to go... Whoa!" Suddenly, he looked to his right, raising his voice a bit, exclaimed, "Well, well, Consul dear. Your reputation certainly precedes you..." Ethel followed his glance. We could see some tall plateau standing in the distance. Zooming in, there were a few short trees with very few branches, red leaves. Out of the foggy air, a flying transporting levnis approaching from the distance. 

From around the flying levnis, we could see the flame clock levnis had two big wheels by its body, its arms stretched outwards and kept low, having two giant wheels on each hand, diameter almost approaching the radius of those two big wheels by its side. Some claw-like features stretched above the four smaller wheels. Barracks, garrison, and watchtowers formed a square residency area, as if hugged by the flame clock levnis. The air was foggy, but we could see some translucent lofty plateau, and a taller tree with red leaves by the left. 

As the transporter approached,  it stretched out its six legs and landed just in front of Ethel and the guy. 

"Ugh! Sparks' sake, a hover type...?" The guy screamed as the high-pitch noise and the dust showered him and Ethel. "I mean, did they not get the memo about the terrain here?"{{footnote: How he got to talk amidst the dust was incredulous.}}

The door opened. More soldiers joined Ethel and the guy, lining up behind them. Consul K, or rather, Moebius K, walked down the platform. Streetlights lighted up the surrounding. All held their fist up to welcome him. 

"(coughing)... Ohh, why is it so insufferably dusty around here?" He shook his right hand like how you would pinch a dirty piece of table cloth. "Clearly... the place befits its Dirt-rank status." 

Ethel replied, "The rainy season will soon be upon us. I ask your patience, for just this short while." 

As if to think, putting his hands on his chin, "Is that so? Then, leaving aside the issue of cleanliness... " As he scanned the distance, his vision blood-red-tinted, some purple spots were visible, "Just what is with all this fog? I don't take kindly to my vision being obfuscated..." 

Perhaps he reminded himself he didn't came to complain, "Oh, forget it. So? Where are my quarters?" 

"Yes, this way." Ethel lead the way, K followed, and the guy followed behind before the rest of the soldiers. 

---

A wooden huge room, there were windows with metal grids slanting by the top side of the roof. Fluorescent light emitting yellow lights stuck to the wooden wall below. A metal plaque with a Kevesi sign hung below, and a table with an oil lamp laid on the ground below it. K was walking to his seat while Ethel and the guy stood in front of the table. 

K complained, "Guh, what a filthy room! How the Dirt rank has fallen..." As he scanned the room, there were empty two-layer cupboard, some dustbin or stationary holder? And a paper with something written stuck to one of the wall. "Ah, I suppose that would be something to take up with the Castle." 

Ethel explained, "Our **Ferronis**{{footnote: Ferronis means "flame clock levnis". From now onwards, we'll call it a ferronis.}} is an old model. I understand your displeasure... but please don't escalate this." 

"Do I detect some defiance?" K wasn't happy with things outside his control. 

"N-No, no, that was never my-" She furiously tried to explain, shaking her head. 

"Relax, girl. I jest. Now then, let's cut the chitchat and talk business." Be brought both hands together, his right folded on his left fist. "I'd like you to eradicate some vermin for me." 

"Vermin? By your leave, sir, we've detected no movement from Agnian Ferronises around this area..." She reported, turned to look at the guy who followed her around, whom nod in agreement.

K explained himself, "Not Agnus! People. Soldiers. A band of deserters from both sides. Well, something like that." 

Ethel was curious, "Agnus and Keves... both?" 

As he put his hands on his cheek, "Hah! I think it's best you see for yourself. Hmm? This is expressly at the Queen's behest. Don't foul this up." As he finished, he opened his eyelids, and the moebius icon glowed. 

Back at where the Kevesi queen is, the pods still beside. She stood before the giant structure, her "seat," holding her staff. OK. Her seat isn't actually a seat. It is a metal platform, 5 metal "arms" stretches from its center at about equal distance. Two "armrest" like feature stood beside{{footnote: But if those were armrest, even if the queen held out her hand straight, she wouldn't have touch both at once, for her hands can't reach both.}}. Above, we could see a flame clock, the left filled yellow like Agnian, the right glowed blue like Kevesi, touching each other at 12 o'clock. Two of "<" and  ">" each lay at both sides.
