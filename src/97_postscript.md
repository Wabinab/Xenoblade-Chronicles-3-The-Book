- story based on relationship (How to Know a Person by David Brooks.)

Someone asked two very good novelist, when writing a story, do they start with a character and build the story around that; or do they start with an idea for a plot, then create characters who operate within that story? None at all! They **start with a relationship.** How relationships would be alike and different, what tensions there would be, how the relationship would grow, falter, or flourish. Then, the characters will go on to change each other. 

- what college can't offer, you find yourself. (Excellent Sheep by William Deresiewicz)

It's a sad truth, that what young people can't get in college, they'd to find it themselves. If they'd realized early, they'd force it, unwilling to comply with peer and family pressure, to have a life of their own. If they don't, or if it wasn't enough, due to whatever reason (like Covid strike, in one's case), the need for a fantasy story to change your life, to make you realize by putting yourself as an explorer, a traveler, along with the group, to realize something in oneself, and to unleash it, without anyone's help. What before found in real life, in college, are now substituted by other means; and what if they'd never watched this? And if they did, what if they'd never resonated, because peer pressure and other pressure are too hard to overcome, too frightening to overcome, or the story just doesn't yield to their emotions? It's a sad, sad truth. Can we... wake up?
