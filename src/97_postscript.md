- story based on relationship (How to Know a Person by David Brooks.)

Someone asked two very good novelist, when writing a story, do they start with a character and build the story around that; or do they start with an idea for a plot, then create characters who operate within that story? None at all! They **start with a relationship.** How relationships would be alike and different, what tensions there would be, how the relationship would grow, falter, or flourish. Then, the characters will go on to change each other.
