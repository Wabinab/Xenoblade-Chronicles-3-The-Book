# Day 2 at the City

===
Very early in the morning{{footnote: The sky was still dark, not because it was not at noon, but because the city was enclosed to prevent Moebius detection, so no sunlight can enter the City.}}. Noah, Eunie, Riku, and Lanz gathered outside the dorm, with Lanz stretching, with Lanz commenting, "Wow, soft beds are really comfy. Who knew?"

Noah: "I'm fairly sure you've always slept well, even in sleeping bags."

Eunie nodded, "Same." Riku seemed to be in agreement with them. He tried to reject their comments. 

Just then, the other four (including Manana) walked out and joined them, Taion asking, "You lot... Weren't you even a little nervous?"

Lanz: "Clearly you were nervous enough for all of us, judging by those dark circles under your eyes."

"I couldn't just meekly go to sleep after getting here and processing all that information."

Eunie: "That sounds more like excitement than nerves{{footnote: Someone published a book that said nervous is excitement, they're the same feelings. Don't remember which book it is, and too lazy to search for it.}}, if you ask me..." He could only push his glasses up. 

Mio took step forward to speak with Noah, "Well, it looks like last night's jumble of information will be sorted out in the war room."

"Right." They turned to face Taion, to attempt to calm his nerves. Sena gripped her fist, perhaps giving herself some strength to walk on. 

Taion: "...We should probably start making a move over to the war room, then."

"Right, agreed."

Sena: "Monica said-"

Mio: "You take the lift down from near by the Praetorian Hill, right? That's the sword's hilt guard..."

Eunie complained, "All the way there, huh?{{footnote: It was on the other side of the city, if one remembered correctly.}} OK then."

Sena gave her the encouragement, "Yep!" The group started their morning walk. 

---

Inside the war room, by a "pool table" it looks to the Translator. The group gathered around it, with Monica giving the talk. 

Noah, his arm around his chest, "OK then. Sneaking into Agnus Castle, huh...?"

Taion: "Seems we won't be catching a break any time soon..."

Eunie: "So this person who knows where the true Queens are... Uhh... Who was it again?"

Monica: "You're looking for Ghondor."

"Ah, that's right! So then... we've just gotta find this Ghondor, break 'em out of the prison camp, and get the spark outta there?"

"Mm. Luckily, they don't kill us immediately after we've been captured. We're held beneath the Castle, in a detention facility."

Taion: "To perform forced labor?"

"There's that as well. But mostly, it's to set an example."

"Example?"

"On the day of an eclipse, once a year,{{footnote: OK, their eclipse was once a year, not like us irregular dates.}} they hold a massive execution of prisoners at Hope's Rest, a hill on the Castle's south edge. The whole event gets projected... High into the sky."

> From wherever looking, it was like a screen with oval blurry edge, zooming into Lost Number's soldiers. Someone pushed him down, face down. An Agnian walked beside him, pulled out his/her sword. In a row, each wait. The commander of some Agnian colony, probably, standing half a step behind a duck helmet Moebius, the commander slash his hand down, signifying the execution begin. The soldiers each raised their sword over their head, and slammed. 

Mio, in her appreciation stance, "Oh no... So that's what you meant." Perhaps they had seen it before? We don't know.

"It's to show us we're powerless."

Lanz: "And the place they do this is 'Hope's Rest'? What kinda sick joke is that?" The group were in a low mood for a moment, until Monica broke the silence, touching her temple to bring up her iris{{footnote: Wait, they have irises???}}. 

"The next eclipse falls, about a month from now... So that's our deadline for what we've gotta do: contact the prisoner and get the intel on the Queens."

Mio: "A month..." She gently touched her term symbol on her neck. Now that's a real **dead**line. 

Noah noticed, "Mio..." Taion too. 

Lanz was enthusiastic, breaking the down feelings temporarily, "Well, no two ways about it. We better get started... now!"

Noah: "Yeah. And we better hurry. **We can't waste a single day.**"

Eunie asked for the next step, "Let's say we make it in without a hitch. Won't the you-know-what give us away?"

Sena was confused, "Eunie, I don't think we do know..." What does "you-know-what" means?

"The red glowing Moebius eye thing." She do a pinch around her eyes to demonstrate. 

"Ohhh, thaaaaat..."

Monica: "Those eyepatches I gave ya? There's a special alloy embedded in 'em. Long as you got that, you'll be near invisible -- slip clean under their noses."

Noah: "And after we've got the info? How do we get out?"

"You've put the Kevesi Annihilator out of commission. I'm sure you'll think of something." Urrrr.... okay???

Lanz: "Even if _we_ get out, what about your lot?"

"You don't need to worry about them. They knew the risk."

Taion don't agree, "That doesn't make it OK."

Monica folded her arms, "Yeah, well. That's how we do things."{{footnote: When all is against odds, you use lives to fill the void, the difference.}}

"But still..."

She spoke it crystal clear: "I'll tell you too. Be prepared to make sacrifices."

After the group digested, Noah agreed, "All right."

"Huh?" Mio was shocked at his agreement. They'd made their lives top priority till now, and then a sudden change? "However... **Only as our absolute last resort.** Is that fair?"

She was surprised too at their agreement, "That's awfully kind of you. But 'kind' doesn't win wars. There's a Nopon called Samon in engineering. He'll be able to find you a way into the Castle. Get the details from him."

---

Outside the war room, the group was asking a Lost Numbers the exact whereabouts of Mr. Samon. Someone called Olive replied, "Mr. Samon's engineering department? Go down the lift near Dolgan Cliff and you'll find it in no time. It's the big lift you took to get up here. You know the one?" 

Noah nodded, "Right."

"Wel, that's it! Ciao!" She then turned to join her group, where 4 others were waiting. There was a crazy automaton that stood by a beam of green light that monitor the surrounding. The group seems to the the Ouroboros candidates? They looked similar...

Lanz: "Oh what, you're not gonna show us the way?"

A guy called Jensen from the group overheard his complaint, "There's a strategy meeting we have to be at, discussing what to do after the infiltration. "

Mio: "Oh, you're infiltrating the prison too?"

"Well, it was originally _our_ plan." Still bitter at the group. 

Noah: "I see. Looking forward to working with you, then."

He shook his head, "Yeah, sorry, not going to be al buddy-buddy with you." Then, the group turned and leave them alone. 

As they watched them leave, Eunie finally spit out, "Wow, what crawled up his arse?"

Taion: "Look at it from their perspective. We essentially took the Ouroboros powers that were originally intended for them."

Sena: "But..."

Lanz continued her statement, "What does that have to do with any of this?"

Noah stopped them lingering on the topic for too long, "Let's just play our part for now. We should head to engineering."

---

The group stop beside a puddle of water, where there seems to be a boat parked in it. Perhaps it linked to some body mass of water? The roads on top of the water was metal mesh. At one side where they descended, 'behind' the body of water, parked several transporting levnises (similar to the ones that grabbed the growth modules before). On the other side of where the group stood were presumably Mr. Samon's engineering department.

Noah spoke to a yellow Nopon standing beside the ship, asking for attention, "Excuse me, are you Samon?"

Yellow Nopon wearing a vest, with a hammer behind, and long moustache, "Most indeed! And are friends famed Ouroboros? I hear everything from Monica. Will lend spare ship to friends, no worry."

"Thank you very much for this."{{footnote: The extra hero accompanying was [Ashera](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Ashera). She was the commander of Colony 11, Colony 11 being the 'final gate' located directly outside of the Keves Castle main entrance. We saw it before: the group moved aside and swing through the hovering reefs instead.}}

Looking at the ship with soldier green coating, some lights, and looked like a train shape (to cut waves and winds), Samon told them, "She good ship. 'Boundary' the name. Friends feel free to use."

Lanz was impressed, "Whoa, nice piece of kit, this!"

Eunie too, "I've never seen a real ship before, except in the textbooks..."

Samon: "If friends feeling gratitude, can show respect by adding Mr. to start of name." He sure wants the privilege, eh! 

Taion: "...Mr. Samon. Uh, sorry to cut the pleasantries short, but could you tell us more about the infiltration plan?"

"At least ask about boat first, meh..." A Nopon engineers' desire to show off his engineering design cannot be matched by anything unrelated to engineering! "Bah... Fine. Samon explain, so listen up. Surrounding of Agnus Castle under exceptionally strict guard. Nothing to unexpect. Even with the most state-of-art cloaking device, approach by Levnis greeted with shooting and shouting and short sharp landing. That why, we plan approach on route that go around Erythia Sea."

Taion: "From the sea, huh..."

Eunie: "Wait, if they discover us in the drink, then aren't we really royally snuffed?"

"Erythia Sea shrouded in black fog. If use ship to glide along on surface of sea, will now show up on radar scan from above."

Mio: "Right, good thinking."

Samon: "Before proceed to explain nitty-gritty, we must make ship ship-shape. Friends have to help also."

Riku was surprised, "It not run as is?"

Shaking his head, "There not enough fuel for runnage of Boundary."

Noah: "Ah, so that's the problem."

Sena: "Sounds like you need some good old-fashioned physical labor. Sign me up!" Sure, muscle girl! 

"Samon happy to see friend so enthusiastic! Could never hope to even carry 300 ether cylinder by own self, so things were looking choppy."

Now that shocked the group, with Eunie taking a step back, "Th-th-three hundred?!"

Mio: "Do we really need that many...?"

Samon: "Friends must remember, once depart on ship, there nowhere to top up before land of destination."

Noah, scratching his head, "That does make sense..."

Lanz: "Sure, but where the spark are we gonna find that many cylinders?"

"Not here, that for sure. We pour all fuel we had into making prototype."

Taion: "In other words... We have to figure out the whole supply chain from nothing?"

Samon tightened his eyes for a moment, "Perish thought, friend! Samon never expect friends could provide alone. Only need to assist associate of Samon. Would like friends to go see Timna and explain situation."

Mio: "And that person can get us the cylinders?"

"Assuredly! Timna come from one of Six mighty Houses. Should be no big deal to part with hundred ether cylinder, or even thousand."

Sena was curious, "What are these Six Houses?"

"Very fancy houses, in holding of very important people."

Mio don't care about the explanation for now, at least this isn't the time, "All right, we got it. Where can we find this Timna?"

"In Caelum Residential Quarter of City."

Noah: "Great. Let's go, then."

---

In front of a house, inside the city. The group saw an old woman wearing a anti-cold brown jacket. Noah: "Ms. Timna? We've come on an errand from Samon."

Correct person. She replied, "Oh, really? And what might he need?"

Scratching his head, "Well, he's found himself quite urgently needing a large quantity of fuel, so..."

"I don't need the preambles, duck. This is Samon we're talking about. I'm sure he's got a whole lot of guff to sell me."

Mio: "Well, I wouldn't quite-"

She cut her short, "It's quite all right. What's he after? Tell me plainly."

Noah blurted out, "300 ether cylinders..."

"Planning something big again, isn't he?" She wasn't surprised, nodded, "Not to worry. I'll have them prepared... Or, well, I'd love to do that for you, but lately, the conservative lot have been buzzing around. Such a pain." Shaking her head, "The truth is, we haven't been able to secure a surplus for ourselves, either."

Sena haven't heard of the word before, "The conserva-what now?"

Taion suggested, "They're the people who don't welcome war, perhaps."

Timna was impressed, "It seems you know enough to recognize. Not all of this great City's people think the same way." Closing her eyes, a feeling on lacking of choice, "Some are happy to remain spectators in the conflict taking place outside our door. Not fight Moebius, maintain the status quo... They want nothing more than to seal the City's hatches, build up our defenses. Lots of conservative people like that here. But... do pardon an old woman for that tangent. We were talking about ether cylinders... Their lot has been stockpiling more than they need, all just to cock a snook at us. You should get what you need from them." 

Eunie was confused, "Huh? Didn't you just say you didn't like each other...?"

"That doesn't mean there aren't any sensible people on that side too."

Taion got the picture, "I see... So even your separate factions are comprised of varying types, then?"

Noah suggested, "Well, maybe we should pay a visit to one of these sensible people, then!"

Timna agreed, "Please do. Speak to Miyori. She's the person in charge of the material storage warehouse. If you tell her that 'the Nopon's needs are many', the conversation should go smoothly."

Sena wondered what that means, "'The Nopon's needs are many'...?" Manana turned to her and showed her curiosity too...

Timna gave a warning, "The material storage warehouse is outside the City. Mind how you go." Yeah, the inhabitants! 

Noah acknowledged, "Understood. Thanks for your help."

---

Outside the city, amidst the Great Sword's Hilt, standing on snowy floor, the wind blew hard. The group had their eyepatches on, speaking to a short hair woman wearing buckled-up dark green shirt, long pants, and knee-long boots, gloves, and her own eyepatches with the Lost Number's symbol on it, and displayed a bright green iris on her other eye. Eunie prompted, "Hey, are you Miyori?"

Miyori impatiently asked, "What?"

Noah explained, "Ms. Timna sent us. We're trying to get some ether cylinders..."

"Timna did...? Well, is that all? She didn't give you a message or something?"

Scratching his head, "Huh? A message?" He'd already forgotten about _the_ message. 

Eunie: "Don't think I remember anything like that..."

She was firm. "Right. No deal, then. You can leave now."

Lanz: "Whuh?!"

Taion tried to convince, "Look, this isn't what we were told..."

She don't care how they were told, turned her back to them, "I'm a busy gal, OK? Beat it." She then walked away, leaving the group in the cold snow. 

Mio shouted, "Hey wait!"

Riku: "Suggest to abandon hope."

Manana: "She give coldest shoulder."

Sena thought for a while, "Erm... **Oh, right!** She said to mention that 'the Nopon needs his money'!"

"...!" Miyori turned to her message, walked to her for code confirmation{{footnote: Felt like 'Open Sesame' said wrongly.}}, "Is that really what she said? To the word, to the letter? Are you sure?"

Scratching her head to try and recall, "Huh? Oh, uhhh... Was it 'needs are many', instead?"

"**Yes.** Now I get it. I'll get them ready for you."

"Really?! Thanks so much!"

Manana was surprised, "Great success!"

Taion got the connection, "... I see. So that's what she meant by 'the conversation going smoothly'." They haven't bothered with the message before, thought it worth nothing. 

Lanz didn't get it yet, "Huh?"

Manana explained, in the best of her guess, "It mean this person big Nopon fan! Only reasonable, really."

Timna asked for the quantities, "So, how many do you need?"

Noah: "Erm, 300 ether cylinders. Is that... manageable...?"

"I'll check. Hold tight. Also, don't let anyone near the storage."

"Sure thing..." She turned back into the storage, closing the bulky door behind her. 

Lanz can now complain outside her hearing range, throwing his hands high into the air, "Don't let anyone near? Pfft, like anyone'd bother coming out here without a rock-solid reason..."

Taion suggested, "It sounded like the faction she belongs to doesn't want any involvement with us. I imagine she doesn't want to be suspected of helping Ouroboros."

Lanz: "Hmph... Well then, should we give her a hand? The faster it's done, the sooner we can be out of her hair."

(Here, the player get to choose to 'help her' or 'stay put'. The video player one derived this from decided to 'help her'.)

Noah nodded, "You're right. We did ask for quite a few..."

Mio convinced themselves with the logic, "It'll be quicker with more hands, right? ...Huh?" She heard something suddenly, turned around and looked into the air. 

Sena questioned, "Something up, Mimi?"

Getting into defensive stance, "I just heard something. It's coming this way..." The group saw blue-winged white-torso eagles, five of them, descended in front of them. 

Lanz: "Whoa! Check 'em out..."

Sena: "Why are they so big...?" Ok, wrong focus but oh well...

Noah withdrew his blades, gave instructions for attack, "Let's take them out before things get messy."

Mio followed, "I'm with you!" The rest called their blades after the two. 

---

After the battle. The group sheathed their weapons as Miyori exited the storage, questioning, "I heard a ruckus out here. Anything I need to worry about?"

Lanz affirmed, "Not even slightly. Nobody's here."

"Right. I've prepared the ether cylinders. Take them and go."

Noah nodded with "Thanks." They went inside and helped transporting it to Samon. 

---

Samon flapped his wings in excitement, "Job well done. Samon pull all-nighter to install. Expect to be ship-shape by tomorrow morning!"

Eunie was impressed at his speed, "That soon?!"

With pride, "Samon never flounder. Always get job done."

Mio appreciated it, "Thank you, so much."

He shook his head, "Thanking not necessary. Samon is fixer-upper-er by trade!"

The blueprints on the table behind Samon caught Noah's attention, "What's that?"

He turned to it, looked at what he was referring to, and explained, "Ah, this is ultimate vessel."

"Ultimate... vessel?"

"That right." It was the blueprints of the ship from different point of view, but seemingly had four boosters attached to its side, like the rocket boosters on the levnises/ships. "Even vortex in raging Great Sea not slow advance. It go down in history as queen of boats!{{footnote: One don't really understand what these two sentences meant, but assumed it was a boat meant to penetrate the vortex.}} Still work in progress, but sure to bring to fruition someday. Is Samon's dream!"

"Wow..." That surely carved deep into Noah's mind.
