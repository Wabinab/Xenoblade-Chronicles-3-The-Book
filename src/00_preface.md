# Preface

One wrote lots of blogs, but all styled non-fictitious. Reading lots of non-fiction books made one not adept at writing fictitious style. Yet, there are histories one read which wrote in fictitious style. This is the book one tries to first write. 

Yet, creating a story from scratch proved too hard for one. Translating the cutscenes into words, with an existing movie, allow one to focus on the writing. Furthermore, one really like Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Perhaps, it's time to put it into words. That's one's principle. Write what one like. 

Perhaps this book will never be publicized, for it's the first attempt. Plus, one might get into copyright trouble, who knows? It'll stay private, for now. 

### Other Notes

- What to include, what not to include, to prevent too much detail or too little, is difficult to judge. 
- To leave out things that the reader could judge for oneself, to reduce the no. of "because" or explanation used. 
- We use "translator" to mean one who translated this book from the video, distinguishing it from "author" who both _create_ the story and share it in any forms, and the original "writer" whom wrote the book.
- By "confounded", one used the definition "to confuse/surprise someone, so that they're unable to explain/deal with a situation" **rather than** the other "expressing anger"
- (In Postscript) The Flame Clock were no different from the 'railway clock' we use nowadays, how we're confined to the clock, that everything, natural or unnatural, are confined to the clock. 

### Notes

1. The cutscenes are taken from [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXDE1P7WvI8&list=PLpVpBRIlzWuBPW1F4h7t1bJwl1567hzfY&index=3). As it has no subtitle, one also refer to [this (second) video for the subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnuRO8WfZWc&t=382s&ab_channel=BeardBear). The latter was used most due to the availability of subtitles. Because the cutscenes are separated by game in between, we would join the cutscenes that seems to match a single scene, than to have them slip into separate chapters. The chapters do not match the game chapters, as if it is, it would be too long a single chapter, which isn't (too long) in video but is when put in words. Both these video evade some non-worded cutscenes, with the second totally evading all. Therefore, in case where one think the scene needs inclusion, one'll get it from [this (third) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me1dXXWnlbM&t=7711s&ab_channel=Gamer%27sLittlePlayground)
