# Colony Theta in Memories

===

A training ground exposed to the searing sun, in front of a Ferronis. Agnian soldiers were practicing their skills. Guns, swords, lance, you name it. The only hammer? Sena she is, practicing alone. Every slash sent with her hammer cuts the air so harshly, it sent shockwaves to its vicinity. "Huh! Hah! Huh! Hah!"

After several practice, she sighed in relief, perhaps on for a break. Then, someone sounded from behind, the voice altered due to speaking behind a helmet, dubiously questioning, "You gonna hit something or not?"

"Huh?" She turned to saw some Agnian soldiers with their bullying look on their helmet. 

"What use is swinging that slab, if you ain't gonna swing it at one of the actual targets?"

"But I'm just... practicing..."

Another soldier beside the helmet guy, female voice, cut her off fiendishly, "Say, why a hammer?"

"Uh..."

She didn't even give her the chance to speak, draw her dual guns and commented, "This looks more your style." Then, she continued to dance, taking the center of the stage, showing off her skills of flinching the guns. 

"Huh..."

The first guy agreed, "Totally..."

"Right?" Then, they laughed in unison before leaving. Sena felt down. 

"Ah..."

Suddenly, "Whoa!" A group of soldiers were impressed by someone at a distance. Sena turned to look in that direction. Other soldiers stopped behind a fence and peered through the holes. Inside the 'ring', Mio was battling against a faceless dual-sword soldier. She dashed towards him/her, and with one slash, sent one of the sword high up into the air. 

"Whoa!"

Sena was equally impressed, and saw Mio helped the guy up, someone near her chatting, "Spark me silly... She beat five eighth-termers in a row. Mio, eh? She that off-seer?"

"Yeah. She should be the one heading to the front lines, not us."

Sena turned to look at her hammer; the contrast between praise and bully. 

While the people walked away to do their job, she stood still, feeling down. Mio walked out of the ring, walking towards her. Though feeling down, she wouldn't show it to her; turning to greet her, she enthusiastically called out and started walking towards her, "Nice one, Mimi! That was awesome. Poor eighth-termers... You mopped the floor with them!"

She brought out a water bottle from her pocket and handed it to Mio, "Thank you, Sena."

"Hahaha!"

"Hang on... Where's Miyabi?"

"Oh, Miyabi? The commander and Consul wanted to see her in Command."

"Oh... OK." The atmosphere suddenly felt cold... Mio broke the ice, "Hey, fancy a bite?"

"Mmm... Mmm, sure, I'm a bit peckish."

"It's a bit early, I s'pose."

"Nope! I'm ready if you are!" Then, they walked off into the distance, presumably the canteen.

Sitting on the 2-person table facing each other, they were having 2 bread, 2 slices of fish on a leaves, and some red soup (carrot? tomato? other ingredients?). Both took the same set of plates.

Mio took a look at her plates, "Huh? I was under the impression that you didn't like fish."

"Huh? Ah... That is true... But... Can't be too picky! My muscles need protein, y'know! Hahahah...." She tries to shake off the nervousness. Yet, Mio looked seriously at her, wasn't diverted by her recourseful{{footnote: The translator invented the word, probably (at least it's not in standard dictionary): meaning 'full of recourse'.}} tone. 

In a strict tone, "Hey, Sena...? There's no need for this."

"Huh?"

"Just be yourself. You know you don't have to do what I do, right?"

Nervously shaking her head, "N... no, that's not..."

Then, Mio put one of her hands on Sena's palm, to reassure her. Sena looked up and saw her stood up, bent forward on her, "Sena..."

Her tone back to low, "Uh... Sorry."

"C'mon... You say that too often. You've nothing to apologize for, Sena."

"Uh... OK..."

"Eat what you enjoy. Never stop being you, 'Kay?"

"Uhh..." She looked down, don't know what to say, nor promise anything.

The group just slid through a rope onto an island, escaped from the castle. They continued running with Noah and Mio in lead, not yet safe with the castle behind them. Sena was running behind Mio, kept her vision fixated on her as they ran, her mind somewhere else. She recalled how she and Mio worked together, trying to destroy the annihilator. She recalled how she slammed into the frequency shield the Queen raised, did not leave a dent, and how the Queen lost herself with a short circuit. 

The island was barren as usual; brown grass presumably unhealthy. Hills to the right of where the group was running. There were some larger patch of grass that were dark green. 

Suddenly, Noah stopped, turned to face the Castle, remarked, "I think that should... be far enough." The group followed his glance after they stopped. The Castle still lurked close, though, still gigantic and tall. We could see black smoke rising from one of the part; presumably that's the damage of an exploding annihilator not put out. 

Sena self-questioned her actions, "Did I... do good out there...?"

Lanz overheard her, "Hm? What was that?"

She raised her tone into an uplifting one, to shake off his doubt, "Huh? What's that? Haha... D-did I say something?"

"Uhh... I mean, you just said something about doing good or whatever?"

"Hah! That's funny, musta just slipped out. Ahahah..." She scratched her head in nervousness. Lanz sensed some story in her that she wasn't willing to share yet. The atmosphere got cold as she don't know how to face him. 

Lanz, after a while, commented, "You seem so... lonely."

"Huh?"

Recalling from what he saw when they Interlinked, he questioned out, "*At training, in camp, at night...*" Others were speaking with each other or other soldiers, even Mio standing beside her spoke to another soldier; only herself, back laid on the fence, arms made a V (both fist joined in front of thigh), looked down, alone. "*She's always got friends right by her.*" Another scene, other people sat by a table, Sena sat beside Mio, but Mio spoke with others than her. "*But... why's it seem like... she's all alone?*" "How come?"

Her breath was unsteady, "So that's the way you see me, huh? A loner."

"Sena..."

She tried to kept her uplifting tone, even by force, "I was hoping more... 'Plucky heroine girl', or 'one-track musclehead'. That's more what I kinda shoot for..."

"Now, look..."

"Oh, no, you don't. I think you're just being nosy!" Her tone getting more reverberating, compressing her urge to cry behind her 'happiness'. 

"Sena... Please..."

"I'm fine! Really. Don't worry about me." That halts the conversation.

Still at the same place, but zooming out to a group conversation at a later time,

Eunie: "...Can you believe we've just had to run all that way?"

Taion: "I don't know who they were, but had that force not intervened... I shudder to think what would have happened."

"What would have happened was, it would have been curtains for us."

"Usually a strategy is something you're supposed to prepare beforehand."

Noah kept quiet, lost in his thought for the moment, until Lanz turned to wake him up, "Noah?" After he turned his attention to him, Lanz continued, "I guess we have no more use for Castles and Queens, huh."

Eunie added, "We're not going back, I know that much."

Mio concur, "Nope, we're going forward now."

Noah: "...You're right." They turned their attention to the other direction, the great sword pierced near; though, they still have some distance to go. The small hill made a bridge on top of the valley they were going to cross. "Not far now before we reach Swordmarch. Let's go."
