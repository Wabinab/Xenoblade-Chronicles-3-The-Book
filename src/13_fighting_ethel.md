# Fighting Ethel and K

===

They were traversing the route when Lanz noticed something that stood out in the bleak environment. As he walked towards it, Eunie was wondering what he found. He kneel on the ground to find footprints, Eunie followed behind him. 

"This'll be sketchy." 

Eunie: "Yeah... Agreed." 

By now, the rest had noticed their deviation and walked towards them, Manana prompting, "What friends afraid of, hmm?" 

Noah: "I'm seeing signs of patrols. Was it Colony 4...?" 

Mio wasn't sure why he's so sure: "Colony 4?"

Riku explained, "Colony of badbutt elites, led by commander of great repute. Whole rest of Keves acknowledge their superiority." 

Taion: "Are you certain? This is Nih'l Valley!" 

We could see a very tall platform behind them that formed the valley. Though, a lower platform half the height shrouded their current low point. Behind Taion, there's even a platform that looks like an entrance into a cave, but it may just be green moss on the wall of the valley that caused an optical illusion.

Lanz stood up, "Right. Like Riku said." 

"But how can this be? How can their zone of control extend this far out...?" 

Suddenly, there was a loud noise from afar, the ground's shaking. Sena was the first to fell it, "Huh? Anyone feel that?" They turned around, alerted. 

"A quake?" Mio asked. 

Noah was the only one not in defensive posture: "No, it's..." He turned and looked at a far distance, shouted, "Over there!" 

From behind a rock, we could see the claws of Ethel's ferronis emerged. The wheels destroyed the mound as it tramples over it, crushing it into smaller rocks.  The flame clock was quarterly filled, driving towards their location. The ferronis was so huge that it almost scratch against the wall of the valley, and its body was almost as high as the taller platforms that made up the valley. As it stopped in the distance, levnises were deployed and lead their way, while solders running closely behind. 

The ferronis didn't stay idle either. From its back, it fired two cannonballs which landed just in front of the group, sending flares bursting as it throws up sand and dirt into the sky. The group ran for their lives while dodging the blasts. 

Suddenly, two of the blasts landed at the walls of the valley, smashed rocks came trampling down and blocked their road. They quickly stopped in their path, turned and ran towards where they came from. 

From atop the Ferronis, ethel and the guy whom followed her around stood and watched. "There you are. You monsters." The blastings did not stop while she exclaimed. 

The guy raised his hands for the cannons to halt. The blast had sent up so much dust that they were having a difficult time looking through it. It also means they group had time to hide behind a huge rock while Taion is thinking how to solve the problem. 

"Us, monsters?" Noah was confused. 

Eunie came out and pointed to a direction, "Noah, look!" 

"That's... Ethel!" 

Mio: "You said... Ethel? You mean Silvercoat Ethel?" 

Lanz: "You know about her?" 

"Even in Agnus, the name has spread far and wide. Silvercoat Ethel... A veteral soldier unmatched in strength. People would whisper... about how she felled three colonies at once with just a hundred troops!" 

Eunie rebuted, "Yeah, but... this is Ethel!" 

Taion immediately spit out, "We know her name! So?" 

"So, she helped us out once before! She was strong, but kind. She could still help." All this while, Noah hadn't lose his glance on Ethel. He took bold steps out into the open. 

Eunie: "Noah?" 

"It might not work, but..." 

Taion, realized what he was gonna do: "Noah!" 

"It's all right!" Then, he dashed off into the distance, towards Ethel's ferronis. Ethel was watching him, but she, instead of seeing him as a normal person, was a dark figure enshrouded in thick black clouds, with two red eyes. He stopped just right before the ferronis, shouted out, "Ethel! It's me! Noah, from Colony 9! You know us, you saved us back in Colony 14! You praised my Blade... You must remember!" 

Ethel: "You say I helped you... in Colony 14?" 

"You did!" 

"Really?" She closed her eyes and peered, unable to see through the think cloud. "I've no recollection of helping, you!" The ferronis blasted its cannot just as she landed the last word, blasting where he stood before, if he hadn't got out quickly enough. As cannons blasted behind him, Lanz got out and gave him a hand, throwing Noah aside behind the giant rock where they hid once he reached his location as he blocked the blast. 

"This is far from 'all right'!" Taion complained as they gathered around him, sitting on the ground. 

Mio: "It's pointless..." 

"Sorry. I thought I could convince her. Should've known it wouldn't work." 

By now, the ferronis had launched strikes like crazy, inch by inch. The guy again called for a stop to let the dust cleaned out. 

Ethel: "Taking cover? Bad move." The blood red in her iris glowed redder. She activated her iris, now seeing everything red but gained X-ray vision to glance past any obstacles, including where the group hid. 

"Very well done, Ethel." K's sounded in her head as he was sitting by the table in his quarters, he borrowed her his power as the moebius sign glowed in his right eye, "I do so love your loyalty. Now, the enemy is before you. Chase them to the ends of the world. Not a single one of them can escape." 

The guy ordered the levnises and soldiers to advance forward. 

---

Lanz knocked out a soldier as he shouted, "Ngh! Yep, just keem 'em coming, no problem!" 

Noah was looking into the sky beside him, blasts from the ferronis coming in their direction. They quickly ran from their current location. 

"Risky business!" Riku wasn't amazed. 

Eunie looked towards the ferronis, exclaimed, "Doesn't help that their cannons are way too accurate!" 

Mio: "They shouldn't be able to see us from over there." They were currently at a diversion blocked from direct view of the ferronis. 

"How they know location of Manana and friends?!" 

As they stopped, Taion: "The Iris." Others looked at him. 

"Meh?" 

He explained, "Her red Iris is doing this. It's relaying our exact position to her troops!" 

Lanz scratched his head, wasn't sure how to deal with this: "Snuff this..."

Eunie suddenly shouted, "Lanz! 6 o'clock!" 

"Spark!" He immediately summoned his broadsword as soldiers were running towards them from afar. 

"Again!?" The cannons hadn't stop blasting their way as they were chased by soldiers. Lanz and Taion defended their location as blast landed before them. 

"The soldiers!" One of the blast cleared the soldiers for them. 

"Their whole squad?! Those heartless mudders..." Lanz was angry. 

Noah: "Guys, pull back to the cave!" 

Sena: "What cave?"

Looking behind them, there was an entrance to a cave. "We're sitting Bunnits out here. In there, we can take cover from the volleys." 

Lanz: "And after that?" 

"Think about that later." 

"No Plan B?" 

"I didn't have time!" He lead the way and took for a run while the others followed. K was watching all along, both his eyelids opened. 

"You can't run from me, brats." He continued to close his eyelids as the moebius signed glowed inside his eyes. "I've got my eye on you!" 

He peered through the cave; yet the cave was covered in black fog. Taion looked around them, stopped and exclaimed, "Black fog...?" 

K wasn't amused either, "Ugh, really? Suddenly fog? Heh! Ah, no big deal. It'll hardly slow me down. I still have eyes on the prize." His vision can still see where the group was running, though with stuttering interruptions. 

---

They stopped inside the cave. The brightness wasn't justified by a blocked sunlight.{{footnote: This, from second video, with "morning" time.}} Taion was leaning on a rock, noticed something, now that he had time to think and to connect the dots: "Hmmm..."

Lanz: "Hey, Taion! Have you been hit?" 

"No..." 

"Then what?" 

"The enemy's acting strangely. Something's off." 

Mio: "Off how?" 

"Even when we engage, the other soldiers don't provide backup. It's like none of them have been given orders." 

Eunie, from behind him, "You're overthinkin' it." 

"I thought I was, at first..." Then, he turned to get someone who could get him second him, "Hey, Noah!"

Noah nodded, "Yeah. I agree with Taion. They did seem kind of slow to respond." 

Taion thought for a while, his speech triggered something, "Oh, no." He looked back at the entrance. The cave wall lurked about 5 meters from the ground. 

---

As they arrived at the end of the tunnel, an oasis was seen beyond the edge below them. Noah: "We can get down from the left side. With any luck, we can lead them the wrong way. (gasp)" 

Suddenly, there was a shaking and rumbling coming from behind them. From the side, the ferronis droved itself to block their path, waited for them at the entrance. It parked very near them. We could see only Ethel standing by the head of the ferronis, the other guy was gone. 

Eunie: "Ethel!" 

She jumped off the ferronis and landed in front of them. "So unfortunate." Soldiers and levnises had cut their retreat route into the cave. 

Taion: "Huh! She read us like a book!" 

Noah: "Ethel! Do you really not recognize us at all?!" 

"Disgusting..."

"Huh?" 

"The sight of you _things_ speaking the words of man... It makes my skin crawl!" She drew her blades, prepared to fight. 

"Ugh... We'll never get through..." 

Lanz: "Come off it! Just what the spark does she see us as, Gogols{{footnote: Gogols are a gorilla-like monster in the game}}?" 

Eunie drew her blade, "She's right there. Why don't you ask her?" 

"Like we'll get a straight answer!" Her eyes is now not glowing red but orange, like someone stuffed the sun into her right eye. 

---

One of her blade dug into the ground as she slid backward. As she looked up, she cut the air so furiously that a sword wave was released, traversed through the air, towards the groud, whom now had their backs on the ferronis. Lanz blocked the attack, but the shockwave sent a plateau above lose its skeleton, breaking into 3 pieces as it crashed into the ground. 

"Ugh! She's way too good!" Lanz exclaimed as he had to resummon his blade, which had been sheathed as it was zeroed in the last attack. Same for the others. 

Eunie: "Well, I guess we don't call her Silvercoat Ethel for nothing, eh?!" 

"Tight pinch keeps getting tighter!!!" Manana exclaimed. 

"Mimi?" 

"Understood." She looked at Noah, asked, "Ready?" 

Noah: "We can't." 

"But... why not?" She don't understand. 

"It's too powerful. We could just wind up killing her." Ethel strode slowly towards their location as they were making decisions, stopped by a distance. 

"Yes, but..." 

Suddenly, there was a stronger glow of red in her iris. She dropped both her blade and covered her right iris with both hands, crying in pain. 

"What happened? She just stopped...?" 

The pain was enough for her to see clearly as their real humanoid form flashes before flashing back to the monster form. "Whh-what's... What am I... fighting against here...?" 

Noah saw the chance, withdrew his blade, "Maybe now..." Then, he shouted out to her, "Ethel! It's me! It's Noah!" 

"Did... you say... Noah...?" 

He took a step forward. "Ethel!" 

She, still seeing in blood-red-tinted vision, can see their form despite, shuffling with the monster form. K's eyes glowed stronger, trying to regain control. 

"Oh, if needs must." He finally can't sit behind the curtain, teleported. Ethel fell to the ground, Noah tried to run towards her while a purple barrage of electricity fell from the sky, landed one step in front of him. He took his step back to evade it. 

K appeared in front of Ethel. She looked up, "C...Consul..." 

"Really. This is why I can't stand fog." He shook his hands of the surrounding air. "And we were just getting to the good part..." 

Noah, resummoned his blade, was now vibrating furiously. 

"C-Consul... I... I'm... What..." She looked up at him, but her eyes felt too painful she lowered her head, or maybe she was just confused and regretted. "What am I...?" 

K looked back at her and sniped, "Silence! You were pathetic!" He sent one barrage of electrical beam at her, she groaned in pain and fainted thereafter. He took his step towards the ground. 

"Ethel!!!" 

"Heh. I suppose it's more fun this way." He get into a boxing stance, facing them, without transforming. "Well...? Don't you agree? It's the big bad boss. Boo!" 

--- 

K dragged along the ground as he was knocked back, panting. 

"Did we do it?" Eunie was panting as well. 

Noah: "Wait! Something's wrong." Purple electricity and pink fog appeared around K, resurrecting and regenerating him. The electricity grew to encircle a region around him, Noah and his team slightly outside the circumference. 

Taion: "The light's being drawn in..." K was glowing bright purple as he absorbed energy from the surrounding. As he disappeared, he transformed his true form. 

"The same as when Noah and Mimi...?" They gasped. 

Mio: "He transformed... He looks exactly like that other one...!"

Well, not exactly _the same_. The one before had sharp (canines) teeth, this had flat teeth (molars). His right iris glowing red with the moebius symbol. He had a fin-like structure on his chin. His head had a fan-like very thick structure, like that of a bull. He had very strong muscles, a single moebius core{{footnote: This was the double-ring with an infinity sign in the middle, transparent purple}} attached to his chest (the last one got two, if you remember), and "leaf-like veins" on his hips and the under of back of his arm. A hula-hoop ring encircled his waist, floating. 

"That Iris... So he was the one controlling the troops?!" Taion noticed. 

Noah: "Moebius..." Noah's blade vibrate even more furiously, at a higher pitch, it's ring that joined the blade and the handle glowed with the ouroboros sign. 

Lanz: "But he's looking pretty hurt... Come on!" 

"Waaaaaaa!" K opened his arms wide opened, "lives" were drawn in both from the battlefield and from the flame clock. The "lives" from the flame clock was "filtered" so it shone green than red (particles). 

"Wha...?!" Lanz was shocked. The "green" was so bright it illuminates his body. 

Eunie: "His wounds... They look like they're healing!" 

Soldiers, even alive, cannot lock their lives in their vessel. Their lives were forcibly sucked out from their vessel as they collapsed to the ground. Levnises fell as the soldiers controlling died inside it. 

Lanz and Sena can't continue watching. Both ran towards K as they slashed/smashed him, but to no avail. They were deflected. 

Lanz looked back immediately after landing on the floor, "Any good?!" 

By now, the flame clock had only one-fifth filled, with more soldiers falling onto the floor. Taion looked around, "He did it again!" Then, he looked at the flame clock, "No way... He's stealing from the Clocks?!" 

Noah gasped as K laughed, "Hahahahahah! My dear boy... Your vaunted intuition... is shit!!!" With the last word, he mustered a purple energy ball wrapped around his right fist and punched it on the floor, sending shockwaves that threw the group into the air, apart from the dirt and dust. Eunie and Taion didn't stop their attacks even while they lost their balance, she fired her rifle while he fired his mondo from a "mondo launcher." Yet, he don't even care blocking those attacks as it doesn't even injured him much.

K continued, "I'm not 'stealing' from them. I, as Moebius, have the right to do with the Flame Clocks as I please." Mio and Lanz also cut his back, only to get themselves reflected. 

By now, the flame clock had diminished to a tenth of its full gauge, as he continued to draw more lives in, replenished from the soldiers, "You may hurt me as much as your hearts desire... But where there is life and vitality... I'm afraid I... shall... not... fall." The holes on his body, perhaps from their attacks, were glowing with green particles. Noah was holding his sword up as the Moebius bent and touched it with his right index finger, dragging it along, cutting his fingers as he got injured and immediately healed. 

"Come now. Whyyy don't you give it your best shot..." Then, he stood up, dancing, "and **HAVE AT ME!!!**" As he turned to Lanz, back facing Noah, "Hahahaha... If you think you can!" He turned his head over his back and laughed at Noah. 

Noah turned and saw that Ethel's life was being sucked out of her body. He shouted at the others, "Stop attacking! Eunie! Lanz!" 

Lanz didn't obey his commands, sliced K on his legs as he replied, "You must be sparkin' joking!" 

Eunie jumped on his shoulders and stuck her rifle in between his muscles (which have holes, for some design reasons), "If we let up now, he'll take **US** down!" 

"But... our friends from Colony 4...!" All except him continued their attacks. 

The moebius punched the floor in front of him, sending rocks and smoke in a ripple. Noah was knocked back by a rock as a Mondo saved him. 

Taion: "Wake up, Noah! They're not your friends any more. They're his fuel!" 

"Even so...!" Mio had ran by his side as he spoke. 

"Haaaaahahahahahah! These soldiers will nourish me like Glitter Radishes in season, and we can always grow plenty more!" He danced while he laughed at them. "If I need a little extra, I can pluck them whenever I want!" 

Noah gritted his teeth, "He's killing more of our friends... the more we hit him! There has got to be a way..." And, he looked up at the flame clock as he thought, "What if we... But then..." 

Mio urged, "What? Did you think of something? Come on!" 

"The Flame Clock... What if we smashed it?" 

"You what? How should I know something li-{{footnote: "li-" is "like" in full.}}... Do you mean..." Mio realized something as she replied. 

The Moebius, glowed in purple, now floated up to the front of the Flame Clock. Noah continued to doubt, "But... What if we just end up killing everybody...?" 

"If we keep fighting like this... we're all dead." Both Noah and Mio were now half-knelt (with one leg) on the ground. 

"Rock and a hard place, huh..." He looked up, seemingly made up his decision. 

The ferronis was reversing. 

"Whatever life is lost... I won't let you shoulder it all alone!" She looked at the direction of the ferronis with intensity. 

"Mio..."

Atop the ferronis, above the head, were two "lightning receiver" kind of structure, separated at a distance parallel to each other. At the tip, purple electric glows as electricity flowed from one joint to another, a purple ball of energy were aggregating in the middle of the two tips. The ferronis stood on its foot as K controlled it to rose and gathered energy.

"Hah. I think it's about time we entered the final act!" He ordered the electron beam launched at them, slicing through the land. Noah and Mio quickly dodged sideways as it sliced through their former position. 

Noah, looking at the flaming ground like fire smearing from hell hole, spoke to Mio: "All right... We'll try it!" Mio nodded back. Then, he turned and shouted, "Lanz!" 

"What's up?" The group were on the other side of the flames, behind covers. Taion and Eunie were together, Sena in front of them while Lanz beside them on another rock. 

"Draw his attention for me!" 

"And then what?" 

"I'll get in close... and destroy the Flame Clock!" 

"Wha- But... If you do that..." 

Noah and Mio looked at him sternly and obstinately, "We've got to. It's the only way. On my head be it!" 

Lanz was shocked by their determination, but he's not gonna let them down. "(gasp) The spark are you on about? I'm not gonna let you take the fall alone!" 

He waited as he analyzed the situation. Another beam barrage was coming their way. K held his hand up high, ready to launch. Lanz seek the situation and complained, "Nngh, snuff it. Fine! Have it your way. Get going! Eunie!" 

"Cover fire? Leave it to me!" 

"Taion! Sena! We need you too!" 

Taion was shocked and confused for an instruction from a dumb head, "Huh?" Then, he laughed. "Understood!" 

"Just say when, guys!" 

Noah: "Thanks, everyone... I'll count down from three!" Noah moved to face the other side of their hiding place as he counted, "Three... Two... One...!" The group stood up as they got ready. The ball of energy finally reached its maximum, ready for another blow. "Let's go!" 

All of them dashed out of their hiding place as K watched them with his blood-red-tinted vision. "Heh. I know what you're thinking. However..." 

The ball of energy shot electricity high up into the air, then it fired in multiple directions. "If I keep on firing potshots... I'm bound to hit one of you sooner or later." The electricity landed like lighting coming down on the floor (but much longer and as a beam than a nanosecond shock) at random. "Preferably SOONER!" 

One of the beam hit Noah's leg as he fell to the ground. Mio turned, wanted to save him, but herself got hit. 

Lanz, back to back with Sena, saw their situation and was worried, "Oh crap!" They quickly ran towards them. 

Noah saw Mio fall, he quickly got up and dashed to her, hands held up as a beam barrage landed just right of him. 

"Noaaaah!!!" Lanz was shouting to him as he dashed full speed with Sena towards them. "Mimi!!!!" Both held their hands out as time paused. 

A blue light glowed on both soldier. Their will of protect had gained them the power they wished for so long. With a swirling blue light, they disappeared into thin air, sent into the yellow-smoke space. 

Lanz, still floating in the air with hands held out position, Sena's memory floated around him. He quickly regained his step on the ground. Sena was no different with Lanz's memory instead. Their iris glowed with the ouroboros ring as they watched the shared memory fragments. Lanz turned into a smile as the yellow swirling circle engulfed them into one blue one yellow ball, collided together than formed an Ouroboros Core. The Ouroboros Core teleported to the outside world as they transformed. 

This was a purple cone-shaped head monster, with two string-shaped structure curled around their back, it's sword-like tip pointed to the front. There was a hula-hoop ring by their neck. Two spikes protruded from their back up, as if you sheathed two spears on both side of your shoulder with its tip pointing up. There are four eyes that replaced the ears and cheeks. Two shields were located at the back of their arms. It's leg 'wore' a high heeled.{{footnote: Meaning, as if it was wearing a high heel shoes; but it's an integrated one, not an external 'shoes'.}}

They held out their hands as a purple frequency shield protected them from the ferronis beam barrages, floating above Noah and Mio. Mio was in Noah's hand. Eunie and Taion looked from afar. 

As Lanz's ouroboros landed in front of them, Noah prompted: "Lanz... That form... You mean..." He released Mio as she got up on her feet. 

Sena didn't like to be forgotten, "Hey, I'm here too!" 

Mio: "Sena as well? So then..." 

K did not give them time to figure out what happened, interrupted "Well, lookee here... Fooound you." A single beam barrage was launched at them, which Lanz's ouroboros blocked it. 

Lanz: "That mudder..."

Taion spreaded out his Mondo, Eunie stuck her staff onto the ground; both created a huge healing ring that included the other four. 

As Lanz's ouroboros glowed green, Sena warned, "Lanz! We can't keep this up!" They had their backs while the attack launched, so the shield was like a turtle's shell at their back. 

"Gotta... stick it out..." Lanz persisted. Eunie and Taion was having a hard time healing them to keep a balance between damage and healing. "(disappointed grunt) Was that it?" 

K: "All right. Now for the coup de grâce." He gathered an even larger ball of energy, so large it's almost as large as the head of the ferronis, and certainly larger than his transformed form. With both hands on top of his head, "Get a load of this!" The launch was so strong it broke Lanz's ouroboros shield and strike through the ouroboros, sending Noah and Mio flew backwards. 

Eunie was covering her face as she shouted, "Noah! Lanz!" She glowed in blue and was brought into the yellow-cloud space, eyes closed. 

As she opened her eyes to figure what happened, her iris glowing with the blue ouroboros ring, Taion's memory floated around her. Taion was no different, but he seemed shocked and scared as he watched Eunie's memory fragments. The yellow ring engulfed them as they turned into the a core, blue and yellow, collided and formed the ouroboros core. A huge healing ring formed a dome as a shockwave was sent into the distance, replenishing the others. 

Noah looked at his hands, "My wounds..." 

Lanz's ouroboros also looked at his hands, "They're already gone." 

As the dust thinned out, a thin ouroboros with two wings on hear head, with two broadsord-like structure  floated at both of her sides; some pikes or tails stuck out the back of her feet, and two eye-like structure on her ears, appeared. There was a hula-hoop ring stretched from her back, pointing upwards, two spike-like structure at slightly less than halfway through the ring. 

Looking at herself, Eunie exclaimed, "Did I... Uh... I did this?!" 

Lanz's ouroboros: "Whoa..."

Taion sounded, "There's time for that later!" 

Eunie was reminded, "Ah, right!" Then, looked at Noah and Mio, "Noah! Mio! Now's our chance!" 

"Yeah!" 

Meanwhile, K was confused as dust and black fog covered both his true vision and his x-ray vision, "Wha... The fog?!" As he tilted his head left to right to left, complained, "This is absurd! Can't see a damn thing... Ugggh!!! Where are they?! Where?" 

Actually, he didn't even removed his x-ray vision for some stupid reason, so the only thing he seen was totally dark if not for the UI displays at bottom left and right of the screen. "Where have they gone? I can't see... Can't see anything!" He covered both of his eyes with his hands. 

Meanwhile, Lanz's ouroboros {{footnote: From now on, we'll name the Ouroboros based on who was the main control. As a hindsight bias, there were 6 forms of ouroboros, for all 6 protagonists, so you won't get confused.}} had got behind, launched himself high into the air as he shouted at K, "Hey, mudder... Catch!"

As K heard him and turned his head back, he got punched by his fist before he could do anything, and launched off into the ground below him. While he was flying, which seemed to take somewhat too long for the distance between his original position and the floor, and his flying velocity, he didn't stop complaining, "Why you little... When did you get the jump on me? Well, in that case..." 

Suddenly, Eunie's ouroboros appeared before his eyes before reaching the ground, "Now you decide to open your eyes? Bad sparking shout!" She caught him on the hand and launched him harder onto the floor. Her blades on both sides opened up like the wings of a butterfly. He crashed on the floor, sending dirt flying up but didn't create a crater. 

As he struggled to stood up, he realized something, "I... can't heal...!" 

"Now, ain't that a snuffin' shame?!" While he was "three" on the ground, one hand on one of his bent leg, Lanz's ouroboros caught him on the ground just as he was standing up, like a police pressing the criminal face on the floor. He shouted at Noah and Mio, "Go now! Do it!!!!"

Noah's ouroboros launched from the ground straight at the Flame Clock, withdrew the sword on his back, "Mio!"

"Yeah!" 

They sliced at the Flame Clock, but their attacks got reflected, didn't even made a scratch. He was shocked as he looked back at it, "Huh?! What the?! Did that not do it?!" 

Mio: "How is it so strong?" 

"Then... we'll try!" Lanz's ouroboros and Eunie's ouroboros flew past them as they floated slowly back to the ground, punching on the Flame Clock, to no avail. 

Lanz: "No use... Bloody embers..." They saw themselves floating back to the ground. 

K stood up on the ground, laughing at them, dancing{{footnote: God knows how he had been beaten so badly and still didn't forgot the dance.}} as he explained to them, "Haaaaaahahahahaha! Oh, the futility! The Flame Clock... is life itself. One might say, a coalescence of the will to live." They dropped to the floor in front of him. "I very much doubt it's going to break _THAT_ easily now, is it?" 

Lanz, in a low tone: "Sparks... We almost had it, too..."

"Hah. A fool's errand indeed." The flame clock continued to heal his wounds. "But you now, I appreciate what you've done. For bringing your lovely selves... SO. CLOSE. UP. Because now I can look upon you in all your radiance." He pointed at his eyes. "Wahahahah" Then, he rose into the air, gathering the electrical beam barrage again. 

"M-meeeeeh..." Suddenly, Manana sounded from the side, with very short rocks surrounded them. "Lightning... s-so frightening!" 

Riku tried to calm her down as she cried, "I-it all be OK... Noah and friends will set things right!" He looked at them. 

Noah, looking at Riku and Manana, got reminded by Riku's speech long time ago: 

> Even armor of Ferronis get sliced to itsy bits!

That's the last piece of the puzzle he need. "If it can really take a Ferronis clean out..." Noah's ouroboros looked at his Ouroboros's blade as he thought. "then maybe...!" 

Back facing the Ferronis's left leg, he called out, "Mio! Try again! Cancel the Interlink after we jump!" 

Mio didn't reject immediately, "What's the plan?" 

He told her, "Looks like the time's come!" 

She didn't recall, "What are you talking about...?" As if realized something, "Fine then. Ready when you are!" 

They jumped back up at the Flame Clock as Lanz sounded from behind, "Noah! What are you-"

K was coming down, blocking Noah's ouroboros way. He put both his feet on him and jumped off him, launching them backward. The purple glow of energy ball were just below them, slightly to the side. Then, they cancelled the Interlink. 

K was controlling the ball of energy as he falls, shocked, "Y-your Interlink... But why?" 

Noah had both his hands on his sword, the sheathe that gripped Lucky Seven on the handle had been opened. Mio was flying beside him. He withdrew it from the sheathe, slicing it into pieces (though, it seemed the sheathed were supposed to be sliced into pieces as it formed a glove around his left hands, like a bionic arm). 

With the bionic arm on his left and holding Lucky Seven on his right, he gripped Mio's hand. He dragged her closer so he could put his hands around her chest/waist, hers around his chest. Together, they sliced the Flame Clock, it carved right deep as blood "lives" spilled out from the wounds of the Flame Clock, all the way from top to bottom. The "lives" escaped the Flame Clock thereafter like when you accidentally cut your arteries{{footnote: Because for you to spit blood like fountain, it has to be arteries, not veins.}}

K looked at it and gasped, still on his way towards the ground, "Im...impossible!" He held out his hands, trying to reach the Flame Clock, "The Flame Clocks cannot be broken! What is this?! Who are these people?!" 

The 'lives' released fell on the ground, though it didn't seem to enter the fallen soldiers yet. K looked at his body, "Waaaa... The Flame Clock's power, utterly lost... No..." The light purple glow on his body now stopped glowing, revealing his dark purple 'skin'. "But hooow?!"

The Ferronis, losing its flame clock, couldn't maintain standing, crashed onto the floor. 

In the meantime, Lanz and Mio had landed on top of Lanz's ouroboros. Noah had sheathed the Lucky Seven back into its sheathed form. He asked, "How's Ethel? Everyone OK?" 

Then, he and Mio stood up, jumping onto the floor as they landed. Eunie and Taion had already cancelled their interlink, Eunie replying, "She's gonna be fine." 

Taion added, "Seems she only lost consciousness." They were facing K, who wasn't awake from the shock. Lanz didn't cancel the interlink. 

"Right... That's good." Mio was scanning Lanz's ouroboros for a while, as he turned and saw Noah took a few steps forward, pointing his sword at K, one-foot-knelt on the ground. "Which leaves..."

Eunie finished his sentence, "Someone who deserves a real thrashin'!" 

Lanz and Sena now cancelled the Interlink before Eunie spoke, but they haven't summoned their blades like others, walked up and joined them, "Playing with our lives like they're nothing... You're dead meat!" They summoned their blades. 

K had now stood up and faced them.

"No... Nooooo!" Black smoke came escaped his wounds on his neck/check as he held to it, preventing it from escaping. He held up one of his hands, looked at the sky, asked, "But... why?! How could I have failed?!" He held out his hands at the Ferronis, as if to grasp it in his hands. "I just... wanted to play around a little more!{{footnote: Yeah, your dance, yeah.}} Nooo... I don't want to diiiiieeee!!" Black smoke now cannot be suppressed, escaping him and engulfing him as he fell flat on his back. 

Noah heard his speech all along, panting. As they were sure he had fallen for now and ever, they sheathed their blades. The moebius transformed back into the humanoid form. 

As they walked up to him, dead, Eunie angry, "Just playin' around, was he? Let's take a look at this ugly mudder's face." 

Lanz knelt down beside his corpse as he tried to remove his helmet. "Stuck tight. How d'you get this thing off?" He found the button to release, a click sounded. "Ah!" The helmet evaporates like how they teleported in red glows. An old man's face with wrinkles, short hair combed back into a fashion with applied gel, pointed ears with earrings, huge nose, thick brows, eyes wide opened grasping for more lives, mouth opened too, triangular chin. "(gasp) This guy..."

Taion: "He's so different from us... Is this what Consuls look like?" 

Eunie: "All wrinkled... Just like Guernica. Is this what aging's like?" She turned and asked Noah. 

To which he replied, "I dunno." 

Ethel, awaken, got up from the ground. Noah first saw her as she stood up. She slowly gathered her vision, turned to look at the group to her left. By now, the others were alerted and turned to face her. "Ah... It's you..."

---

Noah was telling her about what had happened, as she replied "I see. I'm so sorry. All I remember is that I was fighting against some abhorrent creatures... And you tell me it was you..." Then, she turned and looked at K, laid flat on the ground. She walked towards him just as he started particlize. Blue moat floated from his remains. 

She took a clear look at his face, "So this is the Consul... This is how he really looks." Then, he totally faded into blue moats. 

Eunie exclaimed, "He's fading... Just like during a Homecoming..." 

Noah looked at his moat, reminded of his final speech, or perhaps, heard it as the moats brushed through him "_Nooo... I don't want to diiiieeee!!!_" THen, he looked up as they floated into the dusty sky beyond, realizing something. 

He drew out his flute from his back pocket and put it by his lips, Lanz looking at him, rejecting him without question, cutting him before he started "Nope, no way. You're not sending him on. You realize how messed up that is?" 

"Huh? You think so?" He put down his flute. Taion and Sena also focused on him. 

"How do you not... Think about the things this guy did!" 

Taion agreed and added, "He tried to kill us all, and rob the soldiers of their remaining life!" 

Noah didn't reject their explanation, "You're right. Both of you are right." Then, she turned and asked, "And Mio?" 

Mio got awestruck for a second before replying, "Honestly..." She looked down to not face him, "I'm not... sure I would." 

"OK..."

She looked up at the remaining floating moats. A moment of silence befalled them. He made up his mind, pick up his flute, Lanz exclaimed to cut him off once again, "Oh, well just do it anyway!" 

He had to explain, as he put down his flute slowly, "Just now... I felt his essence... brush past me.It felt just the same as ours." Then, brought it just in front of his lips but not on his lips, "So... I feel I have to do this, y'know?" 

Mio looked at him, then, she recalled, 

> **Mio's memories:** Miyabi, crouched with hands hugging her legs, asked her once, "Mio... Have you ever touched a mote of light from a Kevesi?" 
>
> Mio was standing beside her, holding on her flute, sighed and shook her head. 
>
> Miyabi held out her left hand, "They're the same as ours. On the other side, the people live hoping the same things as us." 

Mio looked up at Noah for a second, then brought out her flute and joined him. He was awestruck for a second, turned to look at her. Then, both played the melody in harmony. More blue moats rise from the remains of his costume. 

Taion: "Well, he's started now." 

Lanz explained, "Sometimes... he's just... too kind." 

Sena tried to support them, "That or he just loves his job." 

Manana asked, "He too 'by the book'!" 

Eunie replied, "An airhead -- that's what he is. Don't think he's thinkin' about it too deeply." 

Lanz crossed his arms, "Just doing it because it's part of his nature, eh?" Then, closed his eyes and shook his head, "Mmm... Weirdo." 

Taion: "I concur." 

"Mimi..."

As the melody came to an end, most of the essence floated straight up, like going into heaven. 

After Mio kept her flute and Noah held it down, Noah looked at her and apologized, "Sorry... You didn't have to help." 

She shook her head, "It's fine. It's our duty." 

"I'm worried... I didn't play well." 

"But why? You did it expertly, just like last time." 

His hands was shaking as he held his flute, "I still... can't stop shaking." 

"Because of the Flame Clock?" 

"Yeah... I was... terrified." 

She looked up, "Still... All thanks to your decision, we're alive." Then, she looked back at him, "You're really... something." 

He was back-facing her, deny his sole effort "It was... a team effort." Then, he turned and face the others, Ethel inclusive. Then, he looked up and see the final of the moats floated into the distance.
