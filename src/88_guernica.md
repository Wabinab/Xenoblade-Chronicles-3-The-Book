# More About Guernica

(Edit Taion's side story first before this.)

===

"Monica! Can we talk?" In the war room, Noah and his group met Monica and Travis. 

"What's up? Sounds ominous."

"We were... hoping we could ask you about someone... Guernica, in fact."

Her eyebrows raised, "About Dad?"

Mio commented, "Everyone in the City speaks so highly of him. But we still don't know a whole lot about him. I think we owe him that much."

Without further thinking, she proceeded, "All right. Where do you wanna start?"

Noah: "You were brought up by him, right? So... we thought you'd probably understand him better than anyone else."

"**HAH!** I wish that _were_ the case." After a short pause, she continued, "The Guernica Vandham that I knew, was a man that _I always looked up to._ He was always _busy keeping the City together, or fighting out on the front line..._ Always distant... After I chose a military life, _he didn't even talk to me like a parent any more._"

"You mean... you weren't on very good terms?"

"I got to know the man, _I think_. But not the father. _I just thought... that we'd have more time together..._"

"_Huh..._" All dropped their head in unison, the mood dark. Perhaps that's why she also treated her daughter the same? 

Just then, Travis intercepted, "'Ey, Boss... _You're making the kids feel guilty..._"

"Huh, Ah, sorry. I don't blame you guys for any of this. Dad... Guernica... died in the line of duty, trying to accomplish his aim. _But that's not all._ He died fighting for what he believed in; and he saw it through. Of that much I'm sure."

Mio, in her appreciation stance, "_For what he believed in..._"

Travis added, "Well, about that... There- still might be a bit of un-finished business there. He sure was adamant about getting stuff _home_ to people."

"Yeah, for certain."

Mio didn't get it, "Sorry, what do you mean exactly?"

Travis explained, "Personal effects, from the deceased. Things that family and friends can remember them by... We don't leave any other mark behind that says 'we were here', you see. If there are people waiting for you, _then you just want to leave something behind, whatever it may be._" After an awkward short pause, he continued his story, "I was in the rear guard. I know just how dangerous that battlefield was... _Maybe, it's better not to dwell on that._"

"_Hmm..._" Noah therefore asked, "But... there are personal items that have been left behind though, right?"

"Huh?"

"Maybe... you'd let us do something to help out with that. It must be really painful for the people who never got the chance for closure."

Eunie: "Yeah, right? I'm starting to get a handle of how they see things _in the City. Sort of..._"

Sena: "But if there's something we can do about it, I wanna try to help."

Monica: "_I appreciate the sentiment, guys. But why go to all this trouble?_"

Taion explained, "Well, we'll get some closure from doing this too. We were losing friends every day."

Mio added: "And before we became Ouroboros, some of us used to be off-seers." And she turned to Noah whom was already attracted to her speech. They both nodded at each other, understood each other's feelings, and know they wanted to do something about it, to let the others feel better too! Turning back to Monica, "Guernica went to all that trouble for others. And when it happened... he was thinking of everyone waiting for him in the City. So I'd like to help his voice _find its way._"

Monica: "Hmm..."

Travis: "Much appreciated... Speaking personally, _good on ya._"

Monica therefore asked after thinking it for a bit, "Travis, could you pull up the tactical register?"

"Roger that! Give me a moment." And he touched his iris to find the 'app'. The rest touched their iris to receive "There's the data. We've got a list of deceased soldiers and the likely locations where they fell. Could you check out the waypoints around Alfeto Valley?"

Taion: "That's some impressive precision!"

And here came his self-loathing, "Kind of you to notice! See, that's the thing about us Lost Numbers... We just don't know when to quit!"

Monica: "Ahahah! OK, guys. It's up to you now. When you're done, could you meet me at the Remembrance Stone?"

Noah: "Got it. You have my word!"

After the gathering, they found Travis standing in front of one of the memorial stones. Hearing their incoming, he turned around while Noah announced, "We've brought their belongings."

"Thanks. Means a lot. Can you... lay them out here?" And Noah therefore put the belongings in front of the stone after Travis moved aside for him to put himself forward. 

Sena recalled, "Now you mention it... Didn't Monica put an eyepatch here...?"

Eunie affirmed, "Yeah. That was Guernica's."

Taion wanted to know more about "What does it mean exactly? Placing people's belongings here?"

Travis: "_Uhh, how can I explain it...? Erm..._ You guys have, off-seeing, right? I guess- this is- our version _of that._"

Mio: "Off-seeing for City folk... _Hmmm..._"

While they were in deep thought, Monica approached silently from behind before calling their attention, "You got here first."

"Boss! We were... waiting for you." The rest of the people whom their family members died followed behind Monica. After exchanging nods, the group, Travis, and Monica moved aside for the people who lost their loved ones to move forward. 

Mei: "_Brother Yew...!_"

Zuo's father: "Zuo! You made it back..." Most closed their eyes and dropped their head down. Some covered their face as tears shed. 

Cyma: "_Heewa... You always kept such good care of this... Now look at it... I just wish that... **we could have talked more**.{{footnote: Don't wait till it's too late, guys and gals!}} But... you're home now._"

On the other side, Monica, after watching their reminiscent for a moment, turned to the group, "Thanks to you... these people got a chance to say farewell _to their loved ones._ And I got to fulfill _Dad's dying wish. Thank you._"

Then, Noah brought out his flute; Mio saw him doing so. Looking appreciatively, he asked for Mio's permission, and they both agreed with each other. And so they started playing the melody together. Some of those whom lost their loved ones huddled together, embracing each other for support. Others more steel-heart got to withstand it themselves, at least on the exterior. 

"Hoh!" Lanz's eyes wide opened as he started seeing motes risen from their belongings! That was impossible! They weren't even corpses, how could motes rise from them? 

Sena wasn't less surprised, "The motes..."

Manana: "Sparkles fly..."

Mio and Noah looked at each other, surprised too, but they still had their hobbies to be done. No attention to stop before they finish. 

(Mei?:) "You're finally home..."

"_Heewa..._" And seeing the motes, the group could no longer retain their tears. 

Monica walked forward to comment, attracting their attention, "These people, they weren't just sacrifices. They've entrusted us all _with the future._ As the Founders did. **_Looking back... is not, an option._**" They watched as the motes rose for the final time. As no one's attention was on her, even Monica quietly shed tears. Her dad wasn't just the previous city leader, after all. 

---

After the people leave, only the group, Monica, and Travis left. Monica: "So that was an off-seeing... The sound of that music... It's really something else. I don't think anyone here will forget this day, as long as they live." Noah and Mio looked at each other. 

Travis: "The fallen never got to win their battles. But maybe now, _they can get some rest._"

Monica: "_Yeah... finally..._" Then, she turned to Travis, "Speaking, of, you ought to _get some rest too_. You're gonna be pretty busy _from now on_."

"You said it, Boss." As if his mind realized slowly, "**W-wait...** Just- how busy are we talking here?"

"From now on, _I'll be traveling with Noah's crew._"

"**Huh?! But... then, who's going to handle things in the City?**" His speech sped up as his heart raced. 

"You'll be here, won't you, Travis?"

His chin wobbles, awestruck. Not that he could change her mind, "_Ugh... Like father, like daughter, eh?_"

"Dad spent his life on the front line. And I want to carry on that tradition.{{footnote: Turning to the group.}} I understood that when I heard the off-seers play. It **has** to be me. I **have** to carry on his legacy, fulfill his hopes. I'll fight for you now. Call on me anytime you need my help."

Noah: "Thank you. That's truly heartening."

Mio thought for a while before commenting, "I hope we'll get to know each other outside of battle, too. There's so much I'd like to ask you... About yourself, the City..."

"No worries."

"A word of warning, guys. The boss's stories... are looooong."

"**If you've got time to rip on the boss, I might just assign you some more duties, Travis.**"

"**Duh!!!**"

"Well, at least I won't have to worry about the City _while I'm gone._ Just holler if you need me."

Noah: "We'll take you up on that."
