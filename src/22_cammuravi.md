# N and Cammuravi,

===

On a battlefield, beams fired through the air. Agnian levnises retreated to under the foot of the Ferronis. Flames alight the ground a several instances. 'Lives' were sparsely distributed. Yet, beams destroyed some retreating Agnian levnises. Inside the Ferronis control center, Cammuravi, his arms folded, eyes closed, patiently meditated amidst the dire situation. 

Kevesi levnises and soldiers were advancing their frontline. Beams shot at the Ferronis. Soldiers frontline clashed, Agnian soldiers immediately fall, turned into corpses, 'lives' escaping. 

At a higher platform, perhaps the Kevesi Ferronis's balcony, a commander stood as he watched 'lives' lit the battlefield red; a Consul stood to his 7 o'clock, hearing him exclaimed, "It's... I-it's...! It's rising! We're getting more life!"

His Ferronis model represents a jelly-fish head, Flame Clock quarterly filled while 'lives' being drawn into it. He continued, "This is Colony Delta? That's Smoldering Cammuravi...! His valor, it's the stuff of legends, but..." Cammuravi's Ferronis didn't move a bit even when Kevesi Levnises were firing at it. 

As he saw Cammuravi's Flame Clock dropped near zero, he was confident, "We can win! We're gonna make it! Consul, Sir!" The cone-followed-by-cork-shape head Consul just watched his excitement without commenting. 

The Kevesi Ferronis was, one fifth the height of Cammuravi's Ferronis, with a gatling gun, fired from bottom to top at Cammuravi's Ferronis. We see the latter started falling to the ground. The Kevesi commander gave his command, "Right! All troops! Full advance, and don't let up! Don't let a single life slip from your grasp!!!"

Inside the Ferronis control room; before, the walls were dark. Now, the screen around it lit up and displayed the surrounding area. Cammuravi, with his eyes closed, targeted the joints of the Kevesi Ferronis, triangle points locked onto them: one on the head, one at the gatling gun, two at the leg joints, and two more at the bottom of the legs. 

Cammuravi's eyes finally opened; his left Iris blinked for a moment before he took action, gas released from his Ferronis's armpits helped floated it back up. As it rose into the air, it's dress split into half, undressed; it's Flame Clock tilted upward; below it revealed two legs. It crashed back onto the ground as it opened up, with wings behind its back; and two broadsword like structure near the 'joints' of the wings, pointing upwards. 

"Huh?" The Kevesi commander was shocked at the change of situation. "Wh-what the?! What's... that Ferronis?!" Between the broadsword-like structure (at the center of the wing), the spear (his weapon) shot up straight into the air, dropped down as he grabbed it. He made a slice that released flames at the soldiers and levnises on the ground. Holding it with both hands, spear tip pointing towards the air over its left shoulder, he made another slash towards the Kevesi Ferronis's direction. Then, he held the spear and pointed it forward. 

Inside the control center, his blade was equally unsheathed, looked with uninterrupted attention at the Kevesi Ferronis as he announced, "Listen here... You've done well to come this far! But now..." The spear swooped over his left shoulder, then he held it straight up in front of him as his arm caressed the spear's body, "Smoldering Cammuravi... takes the field."

"No... No way!" As Cammuravi advanced, some Agnian soldiers stood below the Ferronis, the Kevesi commander just realized, "He let us think we had them pinned... But really... we were the ones... that were trapped?!" Now, the Agnian soldiers advanced as if the Kevesi soldiers were tofu. 

As Cammuravi's Ferronis got closer and closer, "S-spark this! Everyone, pull back! Full retreat!" Every slash from Cammuravi brought flames on the ground; they rose as high as where the Kevesi commander's platform. "We gotta leg it before-!"

Just before Cammuravi took the final poke, the Consul disappeared into purple particles. One poke and the head of the Kevesi's Ferronis were gone, black smoke rose from it and it dropped to the ground. As 'lives' filled Cammuravi's Ferronis, he climbed out of the control room onto the shoulders  of his Ferronis, and just look.

Unsure where, perhaps a jail room. Cammuravi was in it, sitting meditatively. As he heard footsteps, he asked, "Just who are you? Perhaps a guard? Perhaps not."

It was N, "Well, well. 'Smoldering Cammuravi'... Your name... is no mere affectation." As he closed in, Cammuravi opened his eyes, stood up, and turned to face him. 

"A Consul...? No... You're..." N's moebius symbol appeared on his right Iris as Cammuravi spoke.
