# N and Cammuravi

Beams flared through the air; 'lives' floated near the ground. Agnian levnises retreated to under the foot of a Ferronis, with shades of dark red. Flames flared the battlefield. Inside a room, probably the Ferronis control center, Cammuravi, his arms folded, eyes, closed, meditated amidst the seemingly dire situation. 

Kevesi levnises and soldiers marched forwards, pushing their frontline. Flames blasted at Cammuravi's Ferronis does not deal any visible damage. The Kevesi had no difficulty finding their target amidst thick cloud of dust. Some Agnian soldiers exchanged blows with the Kevesi; all fall to the ground, turn into corpses, and 'lives' floated off their remains. 

The hand-wheel levnises seemingly modified, had two pointed structure behind which fired cannons towards the frontline. 

On a balcony, Cammuravi's Ferronis directly facing it from afar. The various 'lives' that filled the battlefield like virus infection{{footnote: Seriously, if you'd played Oxygen Not Included and turn on the view for virus on the air, you'd know what one said.}}. The Kevesi commander stood on it overlooking the field, with a Consul standing to his 7 o'clock. Lives' were filling the Flame Clock stuck on the jelly-fish head ferronis, which had probably 12 holes that illuminates red on its 'mouth'. "It's... I-it's...! It's rising! We're getting more life!"

As he spoke, his Flame Clock rose from quarterly filled to half filled, "This is Colony Delta? That's Smoldering Cammuravi...! His valor, it's the stuff of legends, but..." Cammuravi's Flame Clock drained near zero as Agnian soldiers fall; his confidence skyrocketed even before it was over, "We can win! We're gonna make it! Consul, Sir!" The cone-hat cork-head Consul watched his excitement and greed ballooned without making a single remark. 

His jelly-fish head Ferronis, one-fifth the height of Cammuravi's Ferronis, had a gatling gun attached to its back. It fired several shots from down to up at Cammuravi's Ferronis; black smoke rose where it was hit, and it started drifting backwards as Newton's Third Law work out. "Right! All troops! Full advance, and don't let up! Don't let a single life slip from your grasp!!!"

Cammuravi was still meditating, his hands crossed. The previously dark screen made of hexagonal tiles now lit up, displaying real time view of the battlefield surrounding the Ferronis. Some green triangulation points came into existence and finally locked on the joints of the Kevesi Ferronis, triangulation point turning yellow upon locking; two at the bottom of the Ferronis's feet, two at the joints of the feet to the torso, one at the gatling gun, and one on the head. 

He opened his eyes, his left iris blinked for a moment. The Ferronis came alive; steam blew out from its armpits raised it mid-air. It's chest-plates split and released more steam; it's Flame Clock tilted upwards to release the "feet" that was sheathed behind it. Then, it dropped back onto the ground, soil spattered on the point of contact. It had a wing-like structure floating behind it now, with two broadsword-like structure that pointed upwards. In the middle was the Ferronis's weapon, a spear. 

The Kevesi commander was taken aback by the ferronis transformation, "Huh? Wh-what the?! What's... that Ferronis?!" As the wing constricted, the spear shot straight up into mid-air, fell back down, and caught on its arm. As the tip of the spear lighted aflame, Cammuravi took the honor and slashed from right to left, bringing dusty flames towards the Kevesi soldiers. Strong winds prevented them from advancing. Then, he made another slash from left to right, the surrounding air heated and burned with a fiery shockwave traversing the direction of the Kevesi's Ferronis, before it pointed the spear towards the Ferronis. 

"Listen here... You've done well to come this far! But now... Smoldering Cammuravi... takes the field." He did a few slash, swoop, and caress his spear, to show it off. 

How high his confidence ballooned, how deep the trench he fell. "No... No way! He let us think we had them pinned... But really... we were the ones... that were trapped?!" Cammuravi's Ferronis advanced the battlefield, together with the remaining Agnian soldiers, Kevesi soldiers were now the ones that can't stand a single hit. (There were no Agnian levnises seen, though. )

Cammuravi continued to waved his spear as his Ferronis advanced towards the Kevesi's Ferronis. "S-spark this! Everyone, pull back! Full retreat! We gotta leg it before-!" Too late! The Consul watched his failure, turned and teleported away before Cammuravi shove his spear through the neck of the Ferronis, detaching it as black smoke rose into the air.{{foornote: Perspective-wise, or maybe because of the transformation, Cammuravi's ferronis is now two-third the height of the Kevesi's Ferronis. Plus, the 'wings' didn't follow where he moved; perhaps he left it behind?}} "Ahhhh!"

The remaining 'lives' from the battlefield were absorbed into Cammuravi's ferronis, as he climbed onto the shoulder (above the Flame Clock) and just look forward, unsure what he's thinking of, nor what he felt. 

---

Seemingly in a jail room; the huge barred windows high up on the several-storey-tall room; stars filled the night. Cammuravi sat in the middle of the room; starlight lit the ground through the window. Footsteps sounded behind him as he voiced out, "Just who are you? Perhaps a guard? Perhaps not."

"Well, well. 'Smoldering Cammuravi'... Your name... is no mere affectation." N sounded from behind, looking at him through the jail door, stopped before it. Cammuravi stood up and turned to face him. 

"A Consul...? No... You're..." Before he could finish, the Moebius symbol lit up on N's right Iris.
