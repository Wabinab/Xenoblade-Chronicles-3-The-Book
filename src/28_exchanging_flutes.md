# The Time Is Nigh

===

Unrepaired roads, buildings with their metal grids sticking out from its walls. As the group reached the ledge, the Keves Castle still appears as a silhouette. In the vicinity, trees filled the landscape below them; and a giant tree the size of Yggdrasil to the right of the picture. There were some lower storey rectangular buildings at the lower level in front that seemingly encased an outdoor area within it, now overgrown with trees. In between the forest and the castle seemed like a sea. The group stopped overlooking the scenario. 

Mio commented, "There's Keves Castle... It'll still take a while on foot."

Noah turned to the group, "We'll rest here today, then head out at first light." Eunie nodded back.

Noah and Taion stood beside the bonfire, speaking. Manana was helping Eunie, while Riku helping Sena with sit-ups. Lanz and Mio were in a distance, cleaning up the dishes. The moon gleamed dimly in the distance. As Lanz passed the dishes to her and she scrubbed them under running water{{footnote: God knows where do they have piped water in the middle of nowhere.}}, and passed back so he could rubbed them with a towel. 

Mio started a conversation, "What a relief. I was worried, about the water." She handed him a plate, he took it first before passing another plate to her. He didn't answer her comments. 

As she tried to change hands, both her hands got loose and the plate fell onto the floor.{{footnote: It sounded like glass, but it didn't break!?? Bulletproof glass plate it is.}} "Ughhh..." The plate reverberate on the floor for a while, and Lanz turned to her, concerned, 

"You all right?"

"Y-yeah! My hand slipped. I better wash this again." She squatted down and picked it up, continued the washing, seemed like end of conversation. He didn't believed; she had been losing strength for the past few days. 

"Hm..."

The moon illuminates the sky and the cloud. She sat herself on a protruding rock(???) overlooking the moon; yet, the beautiful scenery was ignored, not as pressing as the flute she held on her hands. Looking up, lost in thought; she turned to her flute, picked up her right hand, self-questioned, "Am I... losing feeling?" She tried to sense the delicateness of her fingers. Is it still moving as one want? Is it growing weaker? Is it numbing? Is it less dexterous? Then, she gently caressed where her term symbol was, uncertain of her days left. 

Just then, Noah sounded from behind, "Tomorrow, we'll finally reach the Castle lands. I want us to be at our readiest. We should run one final check of everyone's equipment." She turned to see him approaching her. As he finished, stopping at some distance from him, she turned away, curled downwards, the level of stress isn't unheard in her tone,

"Fine for you, isn't it? All that... time you've got." He tilted his head to try make sense of what she's trying to convey. 

"Hm?"

"We keep taking this at such a casual pace. Now Swordmarch... seems so distant."

"Mio?"

"What am I even doing...? I can't..."

"You still have two months left. If we take care of this now, we can ensure the Colonies' safety. Just maybe, we can make an ally of people in the Castle. It'll make getting to Swordmarch a bit easier-..." He tried the logical approach when Mio felt visceral, and the result? Altercation. The more he spoke, the more stones pressed against her heart, and she gripped her hands, now free of her flute...

Stood up, she turned to him and retorted, "'**Still**'? It's two months! Might as well be nothing!"

His eyes looked left and right for a rebuttal, "But... I... You did... agree to do this..."

"Well, yeah, but... I know I did, but..."

There was a moment of silence between as they were considering how to deal with the situation. Noah still prefer the logical way of persuasion. He turned away from looking at her, feeling uneasy as he searched for the 'right' words, "Look, I know... it was a snap decision. I understand why you're upset. Let's just... take it easy tonight, take a moment to breathe."

Her lips shuddered. He clearly didn't understood. Her emotional needs was replaced by an inferior logical needs; he did not synchronize with her feelings. On the verge of tears, mind hijacked, she snapped back, "Why wouldn't I be upset? Take **what** easy? We rest today, and tomorrow... Before I know it, *it'll be time*... **And then I'll be...**"

"I mean, I get that, but we-" He took two futile steps forward. 

As her tears leaked, she closed her eyes and drooped her head, cut him off, "You don't **get it! Not at all!**" And she ran off into the alleyway to her right. He watched as she left the scene. 

"What the spark...?"

As some moments passed by, Sena approached from behind, prompted, "Noah, do you... D'you think you're perfect?"

He turned to look at her several meters away, slowly walking towards him with a sad face, "Huh? How could I be perfect? I'm just a regular guy."

"Right? Even Mimi has her faults. We're only human. The truth is, she's terrified. She needs someone to tell her. That everything will be all right. I mean, **you**." He waited for her next sentence, "Never seen her like this. Poor Mimi... She actually... tells you stuff." She looked to her side, _probably_ expressing her envy. 

Looking to the alleyway where she ran off, he commented, "I have seen her thoughts, you know."

She rejected his remark, "En-nuh-nuh-nuh, I'm not talking about any of that. She just... needed to vent."

"She did?"

Biting her tongue as she put up a smile, "I'm actually kinda jealous..."

"Huh?"

"You're an off-seer, Noah. I thought you were sharper than this."

"What's that supposed to-"

She took a step towards him; they're now separated by half an arm length, asking for his action, "You better give her a good apology later, you hear? got it? Promise me that." 

Confounded, he stuttered while sorting out the heads and the tails of the situation, "Uh... Sure..." He nodded his head involuntarily in the process. Sena, getting his promise, turned and ran off after Mio. 

All the while, Lanz and Taion (and his Mondo) sat at his tea table, watching the scene from afar. Artificial orange light provided us a clearer view of their structure. 

Lanz: "Yeah, uh... You can count me out for any of that."

Holding his teacup, "Huh?" Putting it down, "Well... maybe..." His mondo drooped hearing the doubts in his tone. 

Lanz turned to him, pressed further, "'Maybe'...? What you mean?"

His fiery eyes made him felt anxious. Turning away from his look, and pushing his glasses up, "Er, uh... forget it!" 

Lanz slightly nodded, wasn't convinced. Taion turned back at him, logically explained himself, "In any case, it has no bearing on our objective."

"Too right... We'll get all of this done, then next stop: the City." As he speak, he turned his body to face towards him. 

"Right. For Mio's sake."

"Hehehehe..." Lanz sudden laugh interrupted Taion.

"Huh?"

Smiling, "First time we've agreed on something, eh?"

"It is?"

"Hey!" He held up his right palm to ask for a high five, vibrating it forward and backward to show his intention. 

He wasn't convinced, even though he know what it means. "What's that in aid of?"

"Do the right thing. Come one." He continued reverberating his palms while inviting him. 

Yet, he refused to put himself below first class logic. "Wh-... Sorry, but I refuse to debase myself like this!" Then, he stood up and walked away from the uneasy atmosphere, his Mondo floated behind. 

Still had his hands held out, he dropped it down, whatever: "All right. You be that way." Disappointed, he rested his heads on his palm, his arms rested on the table. But his eyes and raised lips clearly showed he wasn't _too_ disappointed; at least he took a step towards the illogical, yes? 

The moon continued to stay unchanged, be the humans on the ground happy, sad, angry, worried; none of its business.

As the morning sun rise, smoke rose from the pile of burnt charcoal. Eunie approached the yellow-orange morning sunlight with a nice stretching, and an extended yawn! Lanz and Sena were already training. Riku approached Manana in the meantime. 

"Mmeeehhh...." 

He flapped his wings on her belly, called out, "Manana."

In her dream words, "Cannot possibly eat portion of Riku...", she turned to the side away from Riku. 

Riku wasn't impressed, suddenly jumped up and grabbed her and shook her, "**Mmeh**... No more snooze! Sun already hang high in sky!"

Taion had activated his iris and studied some map while Eunie approached and sat at the table in front of him, looking at him. She saluted to him, to which he nodded back to her. The shiny floor reflected the morning light. 

Noah was practicing his swords in the morning, as usual, alone, near the edge where he and Mio had an argument the night before. His breathe and shouts was especially loud today, and with exceptional strength he slashed the air. As he completed his set, he sheathed his blade and looked at the morning sun. 

Footsteps approaching from behind, she sounded calmly from behind, "Sorry about... last night. I was just feeling the pressure."

He turned to his left as she stopped beside him, looking at the morning sun that give hope to another day. He apologized in return, eyes facing to the bottom left, not daring to look at her, "I should be sorry. I didn't realize." After some moment, he finally attended to her emotions, softly synchronizing and set out to reconciliate their relationship, "...It must be tough for you, I'm sure."

As she turned to face him with a smile, she slowly took out her flute, grabbed it with both hands strongly, shared its story, "This, uh... belonged to a friend. We served in the same colony. She was my off-seer partner. Miyabi was her name."

His hands in his pocket, he moved his body to face her directly, curiously asked, "So your off-seers... sometimes work in pairs?"

"Yeah. You know, I was surprised. When you joined in, and played alongside me back then." That was the first time when they sent Guernica home. She continued, "Anyway... One day, there was an experiment... And she... She told me to keep on living."

> Miyabi held her flute out to Mio just before she closed the door to the escape pod. 

"To live life in her stead. To fight on. But..." she tighten her grip on her flute, paused for a moment to refrain her tears from overflowing, looking straight into his eyes, "**The stupid thing is... I was the one... who was... older than she was.**" Closing her eyes, emotions overwhelmed, tears overflowed. 

Noah was recalling what he saw in her memories as he let her cry. "Now I see... That was..."

A few moments later, she rubbed away her tears, taking a small step forward as she made up her mind, invited him, "**Say...** Wanna... exchange flutes?"

He was confounded, "What? But isn't that..."

She felt a little disappointed as her hope dwindled at the sudden snap decision, "I guess it's a little too... icky?"

He violently shook his head instantaneously, "No no, I-I don't care about that! I'm just trying (to say){{footnote: The one in bracket, Mio had cut him off while his voice dampened...}}..."

Feeling distraught and cutting him off, "I'd just like it... to be used a little longer." Holding the flute up to her chest, "To make up for the time Miyabi lost..." Then, she turned her look from the flute to his eyes, "You'll still be around after me."

"Mio..." He contemplated for a moment, "I get it. _All right. It's a trade._" With uplifting tone, he shared while taking out his flute, "You should know, mine's seen better days too."

"Don't worry, I don't really mind either."

Both person held out both hands, the sun witnessing; he took hers with his right hand, she received it with both. She put Noah's flute close to her heart as she embraced, and he examined hers. Some time later, he spoke, "Thank you. For the chat. I'm kind of surprised."

"Surprised?"

"Even after Interlinking, there's still things I don't know about you."

"Well, of course! How can you when there are things I don't understand myself? You're not going to pick up on everything."

Slanting his body forward towards her, "Got to put into words first?"

"Yeah, ***but it doesn't always work***{{footnote: One give three upvotes on this, very very true. Words don't always works. Actually, sound is the most important channel of transmission of messages; even then, we could never transcribe what he really feel into words, sounds, and body language all together perfectly.}}, even then..."

"Like last night?"

"Oh, that? That was me being selfish. But now, I feel like we're starting to get... on the same wavelength{{footnote: Did they study physics? So they knew about wavelength?}}."

He gave a gentle nod as he thought about what to say, before suggesting, "Maybe Interlinking... just helped that along. _To bring us a little closer together._"

"Maybe, yeah. That might just be it." As she finished, she turned to look at the morning sun, now rising higher in the horizon as it signifies another day. Noah followed her glance, looking at the sea of mist that enshrouded the trees below their platform.
