## Appendix A: Variant A of Guernica Vandham's Dog Tag:
> We had used Variant B, which included Mio in the scene, and wearing their new shirt, as the one in the book. Here is the one from the second video, without Mio and his team, and before the changed of clothes. This scene probably played out if you got near his dog tag, can't remember; but one played in Chapter 1, variant B in chapter 2. 

One morning.

Eunie, wearing her kevesi battle suit, walked up towards where Guernica's shirt was, knelt down and check a triangular dog tag handing on his shirt. "Are these his dog tags?" 

Noah, Lanz, and Riku followed behind. Noah knelt to her left. Lanz stood to his left. Noah read out, "Guernica... Vandham... I guess that's his name." 

Eunie, looking sad, "That's great..." 

"Huh?" Noah didn't know what Eunie meant by that. 

In a low tone, "I kinda hated the idea of not even knowing who he was." 

Noah's vision was on her for a moment, trying to read her feelings, before nodding and acknowledging, "Right, yeah. Let's remember him... as the man who gave us a goal, and the ability to choose." 

Eunie finished in a sighing intonation, "Yeah..." They embraced the moment.
