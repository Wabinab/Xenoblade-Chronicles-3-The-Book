## Appendix A: Variant A of Guernica Vandham's Dog Tag:

> We had used Variant B, which included Mio in the scene, and wearing their new shirt, as the one in the book. Here is the one from the second video, without Mio and his team, and before the changed of clothes. This scene probably played out if you got near his dog tag, can't remember; but one played in Chapter 1, variant B in chapter 2. 

One morning.

Eunie, wearing her kevesi battle suit, walked up towards where Guernica's shirt was, knelt down and check a triangular dog tag handing on his shirt. "Are these his dog tags?" 

Noah, Lanz, and Riku followed behind. Noah knelt to her left. Lanz stood to his left. Noah read out, "Guernica... Vandham... I guess that's his name." 

Eunie, looking sad, "That's great..." 

"Huh?" Noah didn't know what Eunie meant by that. 

In a low tone, "I kinda hated the idea of not even knowing who he was." 

Noah's vision was on her for a moment, trying to read her feelings, before nodding and acknowledging, "Right, yeah. Let's remember him... as the man who gave us a goal, and the ability to choose." 

Eunie finished in a sighing intonation, "Yeah..." They embraced the moment.

## Appendix B: Carvings on the Memorial Hall
Here are the writings that described the items. [Taken from here.](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Memorial_Hall)

Ouroboros Stone Cage:
> The object on display upon this plinth is the very first, original Ouroboros Stone's cage. It's important to note that initial designs for the monuments are said to have included a statue of a Seventh Founder in its place. Next to no information remains about the Seventh Founder's identity, and it is possible that this is not due to a simple loss of records. Rather, historians speculate that this is a result of a conscious decision by the Seventh Founder.

House Ortiz (Founded by Nikol{{footnote: Shulk's son.}}):
> In memory of the founder of House Ortiz and the City's Liberator. A Kevesi soldier, this Founder was released from the Flame Clock system by the other Founders, and henceforth, spent every last ounce of his energy for the cause: to liberate the City as one of the first Ouroboros. With surpassing skill in mechanical engineering, the Founder fought not with a Blade, but with a weapon of his own fabrication. He was also responsible for laying the foundations of all the mechanical system supporting the City to this day. Following the fight against Moebius, he poured the remainder of his days into rebuilding the City, before finally perishing at the age of 80 years, though how he attained that feat despite his origins as a Kevesi soldier remains unexplained. 

House Reid (Shulk being Founder's mentor):
> In memory of the Founder of House Reid and the City's Liberatrix. Rather than the Founder herself, this statue depicts the Founder's mentor figure, standing as a sign of the deep reverence and devotion she felt for her teacher. The founder's master was unconnected to her by bonds of blood yet he raised her as would befits child of one's own, it is said. Though of calm and constant disposition, the sight of him on the battlefield, great red sword in hand, struck fear into many a Moebius; and though the vicious struggle against Moebius cost this ferocious warrior his right arm, the loss did nothing to diminish his desire to hone his martial skills each day, standing as vivid testament to his indomitable will.

House Doyle (Founded by Na'el):
> In memory of the Founder of House Doyle and the City's Liberatrix. Directly descended from those who established the first, original City. Her whereabouts were lost after N's ravaging of the City of old, but upon encountering the other Founders, she committed herself fully to the fight. This Founder is said to have a familial relation to the Founder of Vandham, with scant extant records suggesting they were likely brother and sister. She fought alongside the Founder of Vandham then, who was the elder of the two, and brought the power of Ouroboros to completion. Said to have been bright and wise, this Founder laid the cornerstones for much of the City's governance and legal systems. 

House Vandham (Founded by Matthew{{footnote: N's grandson.}}):
> In memory of the Founder of House Vandham, and the City's Restorer and Liberator. THe original incarnation of the City was once laid to ruin by Moebius N's hand. The Founder realized fully the power of Ouroboros, heretofore limited, and fought against N, ousting him. Once victorious, he gathered the old City's people, scattered to the winds, and reestablished the City. With the City restored, he left its government in the hands of the Founder Doyle, and departed on a lonely expedition. No records exist of his fate thereafter. Heirs of Vandham's lineage only returned to the new City several centuries later. Oral tradition has it that the Founder was master of the classical art of fist fighting, and the scions of House Vandham carry on the custom to this day. 

House Cassini (Rex being Founder's mentor):
> In memory of the Founder of House Cassini and the City's Liberatrix. Much like with the Founder of Reid, this statue, too, depicts this Founder's respected mentor rather than the Founder herself. The mentor boasted a robust physique, wielding 2 great swords at once with utmost ease, and facing down Moebius despite the loss of one eye. He lived his life an unsophisticated sort, broad-minded but impassioned, and is said to have aided the Founders in the fight against Moebius, physically and spiritually. He was further reported to have been a free spirit, whose qualities influenced the other Founders, still young and impressible when the City was restored. Indelible proof of this rebellious spirit can be seen time and again in the ethos of the House in generations to come. 

House Rhodes (Founded by Glimmer{{footnote: Rex's daughter, Mio's different-mum's sister.}})
> A soldier of Agnus, this Founder's fight to the death against the Founder of Ortiz, a soldier of Keves, was interrupted by a chance meeting with other Founders. Freed from the bondage of her Flame Clock, she joined the fight against Moebius. Although a soldier, the Founder is reported to have been exceedingly gentle and kind at heart. Additionally, her skill in the healing arts greatly contributed to the development of medical science in the City in later ages. And irrespective of starting life as an Agnian soldier, she is said to have surpassed 80 years of age, though the way she achieved that remains shrouded in mystery.
