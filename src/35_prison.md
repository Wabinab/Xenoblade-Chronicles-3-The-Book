# Life in Prison

> **Translator's note on environment:** Kitchen behind bars. Inmates sat around tables and chat. Prison guards stood on a higher level to watch them out, while ladders behind bars to protect them from being overwhelmed by the inmates. The main room was where the kitchen was, lined with tables. Though, there were also some empty space where tables weren't placed. An alleyway lead downstairs towards the cells. Inmates were free to roam around with their cells unlocked. This, is **Li Garte Prison Camp**, of Cadensia Region.

---

The group had entered the wind duct, watching behind the turning blades. No soldiers watched in their direction, but there were two guards with lance below, and a guard walking and stood in between these two, unseen the group above and behind him. Suddenly, some sound came from the opposite side of where the group was. A guard was calling out to the inmates on a protruded balcony. 

"**Good morning, you snuffin' reprobates!** Beautiful morning today. If only I could appreciate it. Didn't get much sleep." The inmates turned to the first floor, where a guard, perhaps the head of the guards, sniped. "Do you know why? Because the eclipse draws ever nearer!" Walking while he speak, "How many of you are getting made an example of on Hope's Rest **this time**? I can hardly contain myself thinking about it! Couldn't catch a wink of sleep last night, me!"

The group were still watching behind the blades, with Taion heated up, exclaiming softly, "Nutty snuffer... He's really enjoying this." The others gritted their teeth, hearing her elated tone. 

Stopping below the wind duct where the group was, his tone getting excited, "Yet, nonetheless, **the show must go on**. In order to unite our hearts and minds. To keep the world in balance, in perfect harmony! This will be your **final resting place**. So why not **live a little?** While you still have some-**'body' to enjoy it with**! Hah hah hah hah!" Then, he leave. 

Lanz: "Tch! I'll give _him_ something to enjoy..." 

Eunie blurted out, " What term is he even? Is not like he'll have that much longer than them to live! **Ah... Bollocks...**" She finished speaking before realizing Mio was beside her, reminding her of something uneasy. 

"It's OK. I'm not bothered. _I hate people like that._"

---

The group found a hole covered by metal grids which they could jump down, which the space below was unguarded. Noah: "This is... a warehouse of some kind?" There were barrels beneath, but otherwise we couldn't determine other contents. 

Taion: "According to the schematics, that's what it is. What do you think, Noah? There are no guards, so we should be able to proceed..."

"You're right, seems safe enough. Let's get down through here." He detached the latch on the metal, which it bounced downwards and around an axle. 

Lanz was reminded of something, "Hold up. Shouldn't we be taking off our eyepatches? Far as I can tell, the people being held in here don't have them on."

Eunie already took action before they even discussed the possibility of being caught, "Makes sense."

---

The group, including the candidates, walked into the central hall and saw two inmates were preparing for a fight while others stood around, either cheering or just watching. The prison guard watched closely; but since they hadn't started fighting, he did nothing except observations. The group looked around, until a brown-skin female, sitting on a table cross-legged, with two buff bodyguard standing beside her{{footnote: And two other inmates, one sitting, another standing, not worth mentioning.}}, called out for their attention, "The hell'd you come here for?"

Jansen: "Ghondor..."

Noah: "Is that... Ghondor?" Noah was looking at the two bodyguard, wondering which of those two were Ghondor, ignoring the one speaking. 

Ghondor: "I asked you a question. Gimme an answer, fresh fish!" She had thick black hair, large dark-lime-green iris, thick eyelashes, wearing a necklace with sapphire crystal encased with metal-like objects attached to a red string in an undefined shape. She wore two rings bundled around her biceps and triceps, an armpit navy blue shirt, checkered dark-white long-sleeve pant, and some red scarf around her hands like the ones to protect it when boxing. 

"Huh?" Noah just realized. So, a woman, huh... for the name...

"'Huh'? Cut the crap. Any lights on in there, you deadbrain?"

"Hold on... Is Ghondor a...?"

"Is Ghondor a what? Finish your damn sentence! What? My name?! You got a problem with it?!" Her tone surely wasn't friendly. 

Mio: "So she's... Ghondor..."

"Bitchqueen... She musta thought she was being funny..."

"Eheh!" One of the inmates sitting down laughed out accidentally, unable to suppress anymore. 

"Ugh! Oh, so you agree, do you?!" She stood up, about to punch him. The guy whom laughed out quickly stood up and goes into a surrender mode. 

"N-no! I... It wasn't-! I didn't mean..." The two bodyguards looked away. "Arrrgh!" Ghondor jumped and kicked him in his face. He flew and smashed into a wall. 

As she switched posture back into a cross-legged sitting position, her two bodyguards caught up with her, and she continued, "Go die in a ditch, you turd."

Sena was surprised, "Yikes. Never thought I'd hear someone top Eunie's sweary mouth..." Even Lanz's mouth was slightly opened. 

Mio teased her, "Don't you go copying her, Sena."

"Nah... Not my style."

Eunie wasn't impressed with the gossiping. "Oh wow. Way to talk trash about one of your friends..."

Ghondor took the stage, "So? Where was I?"

One of the bodyguard bent down beside her ears to remind her, "Think it was about... why they're here?"

"Oh, right, that. So, what's the idea, sweethearts?"

"Now she's playing nice?" Eunie wondered. 

Noah: "You're... Ghondor?"

"What's it to you?"

"Monica from the City... She told us about you. She said you'd know where the Queens are."

"Tch... So you _are_ the Bitchqueen's lapdogs."

"Please, tell us what you know." He cared more about the information than the complex relationship between Ghondor and Monica, and her furious feelings. "We have... good reason to meet with them. To bring peace... and to set the world to rights." 

"This shit **again**."

"What?"

"I'm fed up with hearing the sanctimonious Ardun crap."

Lanz concluded, "So you aren't gonna help us out then."

"If you're trying to kill the now, then you can just forget it."

Taion: "Erm, kill the now?" (What 'now'?)

"Did I bloody stutter? Oh, you just don't get it? Maybe this'll hammer it home." She squint her eyes, about to share something big, maybe? "Aggy! Oggy!"

"Ma'am!" The two bodyguards lowered their hands from cross-hands position. 

"At your command."

She stood up and gave commands, "Give this lot a bruising and dump 'em in the trash!"

"Ma'am! My pleasure!"

---

Inmates gathered around behind barriers, watching Ghondor, Oggy, and Aggy enter the central stage from one side, while the Ouroboros group stood at the other side. They were cheering like those cheers you see in an ancient Roman colosseum fight. Then, they summoned their blades. Aggy and Oggy used a stick with lights on both ends, while Ghondor had two giant boxing-like fist. 

---

===

Now, the guards were alerted. "Huh!" He quickly turned around and punch the red button on the wall. An emergency siren immediately filled the room.

Meanwhile, Ghondor dashed towards Lanz, slid towards him as he did a horizontal slash ("Hwaaa"), kicked him on his wrist which caused him to release his sword which flew up the sky and landed somewhere while she punched him in his stomach. He backed a few steps, hands on where he'd been punched, looked up to saw her jumped high on the sky ("Huh"), about to land a feet-slash on him. "Grrrraaaaahhh!!!" He tried recalling his blades, but it was too late. He dragged behind and landed heads up on the floor, sending dust in his vicinity. "Urgh!"

"Hah!" Ghondor stood up, satisfied she brought him down. "I put all my love into that one for ya. Ya better appreciate it!" Mio and Noah went up in front of her in defensive mode. As his sword get in sync, Ghondor's necklace glowed, attracting her attention, "_Wait, it's glowing...?_" She peered at Noah for a while, "HUH!"

Lanz had difficulty standing up, "Urg, ungh... Careful." The others were attracted by Oggy and Aggy. "She packs a meaner punch than you'd think, Noah!"

"Yeah... No jokes."

From behind, Jansen agreed, "'Course she does. She's a pro. That's Monica daughter for you." Shania stood slightly behind him, hands crossed, depressed as usual.

"**Huh?**" Mio was surprised at her relationship. 

Noah: "Daughter...? You mean... That she was born from Monica? Like that baby we saw?"

Jansen: "That's about the size of it. Plus, the head Ouroboros candidate."

"Huh!" Shania jealousy exploded as she looked down to her left, wasn't satisfied. 

Taion: "That too?"

Eunie: "You don't say. It all adds up now."

Ghondor: "Oi! What are ya prattling on about? You got something to say, say it to my face!"

Noah: "We do!"

"Go on then!"

"Why are we fighting each other? It's so pointless."

"Piss off, no it's not."

"Why?"

"Because you dags haven't figured it out."

"About killing the now?"

"Yeah."

"**Then stop holding out, and just tell us!**" Is this really the right place to say something when the guards probably can eavesdrop? 

"Tch. Set the world to rights, you said."

"Yeah... I did."

"Not sure if you're just being self-righteous, but take a look around... Think about how many lives it's cost, running after that shit already!"

"Huh?"

Meanwhile, a group of guards came running on the ground towards the group, which cut their attention from thinking deeper. Ghondor sheathed her weapon first, and Aggy and Oggy followed. 

"All right, that's enough!" The leader of the squad came with a pike, shouted at the group as he neared. "On your knees now, all of you! Hands behind your head! Disobey me, you'll get time in solitary!" The squad ran inside the barriers boundary to surround the two groups. 

Taion, as they sheathed their weapons: "Change of plan. Sheathe your Blades now! Let's... just do as he says, OK?" 

"Mmm..." Mio agreed, and the rest followed. As for Riku and Manana, since their blades and cooking utensil can't be sheathed, they slide it towards the soldiers and wings on the ground. As Ghondor knelt down on the floor, the rest followed. 

---

Inside their cell, there are other inmates sharing with them. It's a large and tall cell, with beds arranged in groups of three, and one could count at least 18 of them (probably 24). The group gathered around while one other inmate sat on his bed, another stood with back laid to a wall. 

Noah communicated on his iris, "...OK, got it. Stay safe on your end too." He closed off communication and turned to the group, announcing, "Jansen and the others are all in the same cell, it looks like."

Taion: "If they didn't notice us coming in from the outside... I think we can call step one of the plan a success."

Mio, concerned with her hostility, "I wonder how we're supposed to get Ghondor to work with us..."

Noah nodded, "Yeah. The way she said we were 'trying to kill the now'... Sounded like she might take some convincing."

Eunie crossed her arms, "Yeah, and what the spark does that even mean?"

He shook his head, "I've no idea. But I think I want to ask Ghondor about it. Lots to talk about."

Lanz: "Talk? Dude, I'm not looking forward to raising a merry ruckus just to get out..."

Then, they saw the other inmates were leaving the cell. Turning to them, Riku commented, "That seem not strictly necessary."

Sena: "What d'you mean...?"

A Lost Numbers soldier approached them, "You're new around here, eh? If you don't stir yourself, you'll miss grub, you know." Then, he walked off without waiting for their questions or reply. 

Manana was fluttering, "They even feed us?!"

Taion: "Well now. Seems we have more freedom than we initially assumed, here." Not confined within their cells all day long, huh...

Noah turned to the group, suggested, "Let's look for Ghondor."

---

"I'll tell you what we should all do." Sitting down on the table, with Aggy and Oggy beside her, and other inmates roaming behind, in the central room. "Not. One. Friggin'. Thing."

Taion: "We do nothing?"

"If we just stay put here, and the City folk keep a low profile, no one has to die for smalnuts."

Noah: "So that's your 'now'?"

"Penny finally drops."

Lanz questioned, "Aren't they going to execute you next month?"

"So? It'll be 10 people, if that. They've got over a thousand locked up in here. It'll barely register."

"**'SO'? Lives aren't statistics!**" Taion shouted out. 

"**I'm saying if you stir shit like what Bitchqueen wants, you'll have a thousand lives** on your conscience!" Pausing while Noah breathed out quiveringly, she added, "And also... _You're_ gonna set the world to rights? Then what's that there, on your arms?" She was looking at their term symbol. "On your chests?" She got off and walked towards Mio, "And then there's the kitten... Little more than a month left?" 

"Huh..."

"You must be the most eager of the lot."

"**That's enough!**" Noah couldn't bear her targeting Mio, staring and sniping at her while took steps forward. Mio put her hand on his shoulder to stop him from launching at her, looking at him attentively in the meantime. He took a step back while turning their attention back at Ghondor.

"Hmph! **Just shut up about the world already.**" As she turned her back to them, walking back towards the table, "All this holier-than-thou crap...{{footnote: She turned to Noah.}} You're only doing it for yourselves!"

"Hrrrr..."

"You just fight out of self-pity, flailing around thinking you can **make a difference!**"

Mio snapped at her, had had enough, "Urgggh! **When I see our lives... I do it with purpose!**"

"Mio..."

"**Just one more day... One more minute...** _You've no idea how many lives we sent... All the friends we had... Wishing they'd had more time! That was each and every day for us!_" With tears in her eyes, "_But it was all we could do. It was all we had to believe in... Day in, day out..._"

Ghondor: "You are... an off-seer?" She nodded in return. 

Looking up, recalling her moments in the City, "And when we finally made it to the City... I realized there was a whole different world out there. _'They're so lucky.'_ I really thought that. I was astounded... _Just by extending our years, life could be so different?_ I even saw the beginning of a new life..." She held both her hands up, looking at them, "That tiny little hand... _that was grasping mine..._{{footnote: Closing her eyes to retrieve the sense of touch from her memory.}} I can understand why you want to protect that." Clenching them into fists, "If that's the 'now' you speak of, we'd never kill that." Turning to look at Ghondor{{footnote: and putting down her hands.}}, in her appreciation stance, "Still...! That's why! **We're trying to protect it for you! To save our friends! To build a future that would make us free!**" The other inmates from afar were gathering sparsely around them, listening to their conversations. 

"You've got about a month. That enough? For that?"

"I don't know. My time might be up... before our fight is truly over. There's... _probably not that much I can do._"

"Mio..."

Her eyes stern and unwavering, "But... **I've got to try! _I'll keep trying... while my flame still flickers!_** And after that..." She turned to look at Noah, whom nodded back to her. She turned to each and every one in her group, till Lanz took over, "Yeah... We gotcha. We'll carry on your will! Right, Noah?"

"Of course. I don't really want to imagine that. But... **_there's just no running away from it. All we can do is move forward. We have to._** That day... Guernica entrusted us with this power. And because of that, we made friends with... former enemies." Turning to Ghondor, "Believe us. Your 'now'... is safe with us. As is the future."

Her tone soft, "So, that's your argument?" He nodded in return. 

"Urggh..." She walked towards him, took off the necklace, and handed it to him. She dropped it on his hand. 

"What's this?"

"For the Cloudkeep.{{footnote: She turned and walked back to her table.}} Where the real Queen of Agnus is takin' her beauty sleep. You'll need that to get in. Kinda like a key."

"Huh!"

Sitting on the table, "This thing took a liking to... Uhhh... Names?"

"Noah."

"Mio."

Ghondor: "Noah and Mio. I'll remember that.{{footnote: Yeah! The legendary N and M!}} Mm, anyways, the doodad{{footnote: the necklace.}} reacted to you two when you teamed up. I think... it was probably, like, telling me to give it to you."

Noah: "Thank you..."

Mio: "You're helping us now?"

"Still hate the fact that Bitchqueen sent you. But hey, the wossname did pick you, so. And I did promise."

Noah: "Promise?"

"In three days, Agnus will be holding a large-scale training exercise on Daedal Isle. Of course, that means minimal security for us. That'll be our chance to escape."

"How, then?"

"Hehe... **Well, the only way I know how. Am I right?! Ya dags!**"

"Yeah!" The Lost Numbers chanted in unison, turned into their fighting pose, never so readied. 

Taion: "_I've... got a bad feeling about this._"

Eunie seconded, "Yeah. The proverbial's gonna hit the fan."

Ghondor: "Them's the breaks. Take it or leave it."

Noah: "All right. In three days."

"Just do some prison things until then. Oh, uh... Just try to keep in line, would ya? We don't wanna draw attention."

"We'll keep that in mind."

"Oh, and... a quick word of advice."

"Hm?"

"**When all is lost, let 'em hear you roar.**{{footnote: The spark, one don't understand.}} Got that?"

"Hear us... roar?"

"All that power you wield? That's exactly what it was meant for."

---

Ghondor was speaking to the group after dinner, "We're done today. Scuttle back to your hole, you rat bastards. If we keep crowding together like this, a nice Mr. Jailer might show up and rattle your empty heads together." The other inmates were walking around minding their own business. Aggy and Oggy weren't seen beside her. 

Noah: "No worries, we'll clear out."

"Ah, before you go, just one more word to the wise... If you're gonna pretend to be model prisoners, you'd better put some effort into the jobs the guards give you."

Mio questioned, "What kinds of jobs are they?"

"Hmm. It's different depending on the day. Anyway, come here again in the morning."

Noah: "We'll be here."

Manana cryingly complaint, "We have to wake up early?" Yeah, the only Nopon whom needs Riku to shake her up every time the sun hits her bum bum. 

Sena: "Looks that way, sweetie."

Riku adviced, "Noah, would be good idea to sleep early today. Early to sleeping, early to waking."

"Right." They head back to their cells thereafter.
