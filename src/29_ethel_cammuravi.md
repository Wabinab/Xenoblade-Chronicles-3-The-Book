# Ethel and Cammuravi, O and P

Continuing their journey on some barren war-torn land, Mio's ears fluttered as she heard something, alerting the others, "What's that sound?!" 

To describe the environment, behind them, they just descended from a slanted platform. There were trees and some grass to the side. Turning to their right, where the booming sound echoed louder, stood a giant boulder taller than the trees. To its right stood the old building structure. To its left, we could see the Castle's silhouette (still) in the distance, plus some other trees and rocks. 

Looking up, they saw Ethel's and Cammuravi's Ferronises standing atop the boulder.

Noah exclaimed, "Ferronises!" The Ferronises took a few steps forward before gently dropping onto the ground in front of them, sending dust blowing in their direction; they were forced to face sideways to shield against them entering their eyes. As they cleared, the group watched the Ferronises "unbent" their knees. 

From within, Ethel voice echoed via an invisible speaker towards the group, "I told you life is short, but I didn't mean it like this! Noah, Mio."

Noah: "That voice... Ethel?!" To prove his prediction, Ethel climbed out of her Ferronis, stood on top of it. Noah then turned to the fiery Ferronis, "Ethel... But then who's the other one?"

Sena: "That one? It's from Agnus, right?"

Taion: "I recognize the crescent moon crest... Cammuravi's piloting that thing." Cammuravi also climbed out of his Ferronis to show his face, standing in front of the Ferronis's head. 

Noah: "Cammuravi... That's him... Ethel's sworn rival..."

Mio: "But why? How did they get them to work together?"{{footnote: Borealis already brought the news? Unsure why they felt so shocked when they themselves are working together... And they know Ethel and Cammuravi's stories anyways; if she didn't kill him, it's not too difficult to understand they could work together.}}

As they were thinking, P sounded as she and O teleported in front of the Ferronises, "Flitting like moths... to a flame. N's predictions are nothing to be sniffed at. Gotta hand it to him."

Lanz: "Urghhh... Anyone else wanna show up?"

Noah was more concerned with the new moebius she introduced to them,  "N?"

"Hehhhhh...." Putting his arms on his waist, O commented, "I'm afraid this is about as far as you go. Terribly sorry, chums!"

Sena remarked, "I know who he is. He's the Consul from Colony Zeta! I remember him from a... joint operation."

Eunie guessed, "Then I guess this one's meant to be... from our side then, is she? Never seen her before."

Lanz: "Probably. So the Consuls are colludin' as well? Something's really starting to smell."

Taion: "I concur."

Ethel continued, her voice loud and clear, "I thought that my message to you was crystal clear."

Noah exited his defensive stance as he replied, "Yes, we heard you."

Mio added: "That's why we're here!"

She closed her eyes, "Hm. I thought so." Reopening it, "I had a hunch that this would be the path Ouroboros chose to follow."

Noah: "I don't suppose... you'll step aside for us?"

"Wishful thinking. Give it up." She turned as she re-entered her Ferronis. Cammuravi spoke no words and followed after her the same action. 

"Well, then... We'll do whatever it takes." Together with Mio: "For the Greater Good!" And they both withdrew their weapons. Not the others, though. 

Ethel, from inside her Ferronis, swung her dual blades as she replied, "Well spoken! Then I say the same to you!" The dual blades of her Ferronis glowed in cyan after she activated the blades. 

Cammuravi spoke for the first time, "Off-seers from Keves and Agnus... Fate binds us... I bear none of you ill will, but my Way demands we fight!" Pointing his lance at them, inside and outside, flares burning from the tip of the lance, releasing sparks, "Come then... and test your mettle against my lance!"

Sena: "You've gotta be joking!" The group _still_ haven't called their weapons yet! 

Eunie never stop complaining when she sees the chance, "Mudder! I'm not testing anything against that! What happened to fighting fair?!"

Taion logically replied to her, "We won't get anywhere complaining! Ready yourself, Eunie!"

"Ready, he says..." She took a look at Mio whom was to her 10 o'clock, whom was focusing on Ethel and Cammuravi. Perhaps remembering their conversations earlier below the Bright Fig tree? Then she exclaimed, "From the moment I chose this muddy path, I've been **more than ready**!"

Taion had the time to stood up and pushed his glasses, "Hah! Oh, I know."

Eunie turned to him in, angry eyed, "Then whatcha say it for? Arsehole!"

Lanz stopped them from continuing their drama, withdrawing his blades as he shouted to them, "Zip it, guys. Get ready! They're here!" The others followed with calling their blades after him.

===

Noah's Ouroboros dashed quickly as he sliced his sword towards the Ferronis; as usual, their Ouroboros, despite larger in size, weren't comparable to the size of the Ferronis. A small ant-sized sword met with Ethel's dual blades. Ethel sliced on the ground just as they dashed forward, evading her slices. 

"Whoa! How is it so... fast? Can't find any way to... get inside!" Noah sounded. Despite being huge, Ethel wielded her sword much quicker than him; he could only shield her blows as she don't let him breathe. 

Ethel wasn't easy either. "The joints... Their sheer power really is something to behold..." The Ferronis joints sparkles with electricity as it tries to withstand the Ouroboros's blows. From the screen she saw, with red lights blinking to signify danger, a triangle targeting mechanism was trying to lock on Noah's Ouroboros. "Noah... Mio..."

"Urrrrrrahhhhhh..." Meanwhile, Lanz's Ouroboros was dashing towards Cammuravi's Ferronis, jumping from his strike and landed a punch on top of its head. A ring (from an art) appeared in front of it and released some beams on its face. Cammuravi's backed up a few steps before turning its lance in circles, deflecting any 'bullets' fired at it. 

Eunie's sounded from inside her Ouroboros, herself gliding through the air, "Gah! No good, eh?"

She quickly jumped up as Cammuravi's lance strike her previous position, before landing in front of it. Cammuravi praised, "Good coordination. I'd be done for, if it weren't for this Ferronis."

While she dodged another blow, she remarked, "Thanks for the **compliment!**" 

As Lanz's dropped to the ground, Sena took over and ran with her hammer at Cammuravi's, while he was busy attacking Eunie's. Taion's took over before a being struck, splitting into Mondos. As Ethel's and Cammuravi's were near each other, the three Ouroboroses were swapping their opponent all the time. 

After a few moments of complicated exchanges they made, Taion sounded, "Noah." Their fights never stop while they talked. 

"What is it?"

"I think this is the decider. OK... Let's do it."

"Yeah... We've got this." He dragged backwards before launching himself at the Ferronises again. 

Meanwhile, O and P, watching in the distance, P lost her patience, stomped one of her feet on the ground, "Come on, what are they playing at?!" O was sitting beside her on a protruding of a giant rock. "Am I crazy? We gave them Ferronises and everything! They had better not be holding back."

O: "You think they might be underestimating us? **Us** of all people?"

"Listen, O. Ethel's a lost cause. But Cammuravi... We could use him."

"Cammuravi? Hoh, I get what you're saying! You know, I forgot we even had that option!" He was getting excited as he stood up. "Hmm..." He put a 'frame' {{footnote: That's what picture-man or photo-man do, when they don't have a camera. They aimed their index finger and thumb 90° to each other into a gun shaped, and joined them so they shape like a frame.}} around their fighting scene. "Now, see the enemy before you? Use every last ounce of strength, and grind them to dust!" His left Iris glowed the Moebius strain as he spoke.

Suddenly, Cammuravi felt the headache as he groaned and dropped to the ground, one end of the lance on the floor and he knelt on one leg. Ethel was concerned, "What's wrong, Cammuravi?" 

From inside, we could see his iris continued to glow red as O's voice reverberate inside his head: "Look, you can see your enemy right there!"

"Enemy? Th-That is... My... Enemy...?" O make a glow around the Ouroboros that make them enshrouded in dark clouds, like the ones Ethel saw when they first met in the desert, except now it's Ouroboros form instead of humanoid form. As he changed to look at the different targets, "Enemy... Enemy! **Enemy!!!**"

"Cammuravi? What's wrong with you?! Cammuravi!" As if she thought of something, she gasped, "Oh no..." She saw what O was doing, "The Iris... I knew it. **Cammuravi!**"

"Urrrrrrrrahhhhh!!!" Cammuravi's Ferronis pointed the lance high on the high; he dug out his left Iris{{footnote: With his two fingers, of course, to add in the details!}} As he breathed swiftly, we could see he closed his left eye, dark blood leaked from it to his chin. He didn't subside, remarked, "This is... I am... I am **under no one's yoke**!"

Ethel was shocked by his actions, her eyes wide opened, "Cammuravi, you... you really... Your own eye..."

"I will be as they are! I am... **I am free**!" He exclaimed as he pointed his lance forward. 

That incurred Ethel's thoughts on the topic, "Free...You're right... We're free! **Free! The two of us!**"

Noah was confused, they could hear her speech, "What are you saying? Ethel, what's...?"

Cammuravi draw Ethel's attention instead, "Attend, Ethel!"

She tacitly knew what they wanted, "Yes! Our dream will not perish!" Both Ferronis ran further from each other, turned towards each other, and started fencing each other. Their fights from before had continued. 

Lanz was equally confused, "Uh? What the snuff's going on?!"

Taion: "Are the Consuls doing this?!" They stood while they watched them fenced each other. 

Mio was the first to link the dots, "No! This is... It's what _they_ want!"

Ethel seconded her, fighting as she spoke, "Absolutely right, Mio!"

"Ethel?!"

"Ever since I met you all, I have admired you!"

"Admired us?!"

Her voice sounded on the verge of tears, perhaps the tears of freedom, "Your freedom! I bless the fortune I have had... in meeting all of you! You have... my gratitude!"

Noah: "Gratitude?"

Cammuravi explained, "This feeling of elation... Liberating, is it not?"

"I feel it too, Cammuravi!"

P was confused and angry at the situation, stomping her feet, "Wh- what are they fighting each other for?! O?" 

O's hands was shaking, his Iris still glowing, as he tried to make sense of the situation that lost control, his voice reverberating as he replied, "Uhh... I-I can't believe this! He... He won't listen to any of my commands!"

Noah, enshrouded in dust from their fighting, shouted, didn't understand, "Ethel! Why in flames do you have to fight each other?! We're supposed to be your enemies."

"I told you, Noah. Observe. This here is the purpose of my life! Just know... You were the ones who finally opened my eyes!"

P sniped [use a different word?] at them, "Stop this! Stop it this instant! Ethel! Cammuravi! Uhhh!!! In that case...!" She activated her iris as lives were drawing away from their Flame Clock. 

Sena: "Their Flame Clocks!!!"

Taion noticed more colliding [what is the correct word?] information, "This is weird! Look at the way the light is moving!"

"Is that... Is that their life force we're seeing?" Inside their chamber, Ethel's and Cammuravi's 'life' were escaping from their body. 

P saw this doesn't stop them, continuingly shouted, "**Have you gone completely insane? You were supposed to kill Ouroboros!** *So stop this senseless fighting and obliterate those brats!*" Then changed to a threatening tone, "If you don't... I'll take your precious little life, and drain it dry!" She clenched her fist in front of her, as if to squash their hearts. 

Eunie: "Wha- Did you hear that?!"

Noah: "I knew it. So they really can drain their life! **Ethel! Cammuravi!**"

Taion: "Noah! We have to kill the Consuls!" 

"You're right!" He made his dash towards O and P when Ethel stopped them with her (Ferronis's) feet, sounding from inside, 

"It's OK, Noah... It's _over_ for us now."

"That's rubbish! Ethel!" He tried to convince her to stop. 

Mio: "This is wrong. All of this is wrong! There's no reason for you two to be fighting each other!"

Ethel: "Ugh! You might not understand now, but someday you will. This is what I... This is what, _both_ of us want!"

Noah's took a few steps forward as he questioned, "How can... How can any of this be what you want?! **You're both gonna die!**"

They had been in this stance for quite a long time, Ethel shielding Cammuravi's lance from pressing down at her. "What we leave you is more important! All our aspirations... You must keep them in your hearts! You must take them... Make it all mean something! You have to live..." She break through the attack, fencing back. "**You must live on!**"

As they split a few distance away, Ethel crossed her sword into a plus (+) shape, for a final round, "Here I come, Cammuravi!"

"Let us cross blades, one last time!" Then, they shouted at each other as they don't defend, let each other's blades strikes into their Flame Clock. From inside, they turned into 'life' as they elatedly felt fulfilled, immediately their corpses gone, leaving only their shirt and belongings dropped to the ground (of the control center). 

Mio: "**Ethellll!!!**" The group watched their lives floated away from the Ferronis into the sky. "Huh... Ethel..." She and Noah cancelled their Interlink. 

P complained, as she and O took steps forward, decided its their turn to take the stage, "Tsk. Well, didn't they come in handy? What was N thinking, picking those reckless hotheads?"

O: "Hmm... Good grief. Looks like... we're just gonna have to wipe out this lot ourselves!"

Mio and Noah looked at them angrily, him sniping at them, "You scumbags..." 

P: "Fine then. I did expect something like this. Time for Plan B. Interlinking... You've been blessed with quite the talent. You feel special?"

Noah: "What now?" The others had also cancelled their Interlink as they joined beside Noah and Mio.

"I do hate to burst your bubble... but I'm afraid it's not just an Ouroboros thing. O?"

"I'm ready when you are! Hah!"

"Then... shall we?" Both transformed into their Moebius form, P with several knife-shape blades that made up a wing like a bird, a ring circled around her neck, and a crest like that of a chicken. O is a buff Moebius, with a ring around its very thin waist.

Lanz: "Moebius..."

P: "Now, feast your eyes!" Purple electrical sparkles throughout their body, releasing an energy burst, and they combined together. Thin legs and hands, with an inflated chest. A horse-like neck stretched from the body; she retained her head with her unicorn crown, now more spiky, sharp and long. The bull-shaped head with two thorns, ring around its neck, stretched from the other side of the body; their features look more like monsters with giant and sharp teeth than before they combined. Their torso is relatively "golden-ratio", with two sharp thorns poked upwards in a V-shape. Two whip-like structure swung, sticking out of the torso. It seems their torso aren't successfully integrated, like the chest-part of P still protrude from the back of O; that's where the two whips are attached -- to where her "hands" originally were. But now that she had muscular hands inherited from O, she don't need extra hands anymore. O had difficulty turning to face the group as his head can't turn 180° when P is facing them. 

The group was feeling disgusted with the sheer ugliness of that figure, with Eunie openly expressing it, "Urgh, can't unsee!"

P: "Don't try to curb your disgust, you dirty pleb."

O, forced the body sideways a little so his eyes can look at them, "Hah! We'll have you know that this is the true form of Interlinking!"

Turning back forcefully as he retreat, "**YES!!!** The form in which two worlds become one. A far more refined form than this... half-assed one you've stumbled upon. Look upon us and tremble before perfection! You'll writhe in agony before we-" She was making moves that show off her body like how a model does. 

While she was happily speaking, Mio landed a feet at her face so hard, and she didn't react even at the last second, that she goes rolling backwards, make several somersaults before crashing in the rock in 'their' direction. Several hits on the floor before that sent dirt and dust enshrouding their views. 

"Huh... Huh... Huh... Huh... Huh..." Mio was breathing for air as if she had used all energy with that leg. The group was flabbergasted at what she did, eyes and mouth wide opened, temporarily frozen, gasping.  O and P similarly, sitting on the ground as they try to figure out what just happened. 

"Mio?" Noah called out from behind her. 

"**Stop...**"

P: "Stop?"

Shouting at her, "**Stop toying... with everyone's lives!!! What did they ever do to you? Why? All they wanted was their wish to be realized! You turned everything into a game! Cast them away like dolls! These are our lives here! They're not some toys you can just play with!**"

Sena seconded her a few seconds after she finished, walking forward slowly as she spoke, her tone seething, "Mimi's right! I've got no idea who you truly are. Though I hate to admit it. However, I do know one thing!" She called her blades, continued, "You guys really make my sparks fly!" And she punched the floor with her hammer. 

Eunie now took steps forward, "You there, in the back. Feeling lonely 'cause you haven't been punched yet?" Called her blades, continuing, "You better enjoy that while it lasts, 'cause I'm about to rearrange both your mugs!" And she pointed her rifle at them. 

Taion followed from behind, "Usually, I'm not one for outward displays of emotion." As he pushed his glasses up, his Mondo gauntlet appeared, and Mondo swirled around him as he finished, "**But not today!**" Then, he raised the swirling to on top of him, like an angel ring, but a larger ring. 

Lanz slammed his broadsword into the ground, "Noah, **you better not stop us!**" Rain started to fall, reflecting their anger, reflecting their sadness. 

He also called his blades, "Oh believe me, I won't." He walked forward, stopping beside Mio, "**You make me laugh. Us, 'half-arsed'?**" Pointing his sword at them, "Our conviction has never been stronger! **And now...** we will show no mercy. **By Ethel and Cammuravi's lives, I swear... I'll make you pay!**"

P: "Huh! You Ouroboros brats!" Feeling looked down, they struggled as they stood up, jumped up and became a quadrupeds facing them, O as the main controller while P stayed behind the 'spine'. "Come on then! This time, you shall tremble before our perfection!" Then, she stood up and P took control again. 

---

Mio's, Eunie's, and Sena's Ouroboros teamed up against O and P. The sound of their Ouroboros at its limit could be heard, although their body didn't seemed to be glowing red hot. 

P couldn't believed the situation. "...How could this be...? Our offense and defense... They were perfect!"

"Aaaaaaaaargh!" Sena launched her hammer at them, though blocked by their shield, as she tried to overcome it. It shatters after constant pressure, smashing in their face. 

O: "How did they? H-how could they?! How are they so strong?! That damn noise! Shut UP with your infernal beeping!" They fell to the ground on all fours before regaining balance. "Don't go telling us our time is up now! We were only just getting to the best part!" So it isn't just Ouroboros glow hot, but Moebius too! "I'll take these half-brains, and throttle the life out of 'em! I can still..." Yes, their body don't glow red hot, but their Moebius core caught fire. "I can still do this!"

As she couldn't finish her sentence, the Moebius core glowed bright red hot (seen from inside), though it seems bright purple from the outside. "Nothing for it. Go for full Interlink! O!" Both: "Aaaargggggghhhh!!!" Now, both their core glowed bright purple, and annihilation-like black hole energy gathered around their hands and engulfed it. 

P: "Better brace yourself. 'Cause you're gonna have a hard time... stopping this!" As she finished, Mio kicked her in her face, again! She go rolled backwards, their full Interlink process cut short. 

As the dust thinned, they were panting, all fours on the ground, smoke rising from their body, though no light seen. "You're Ouroboros... Nobodies... You are nothing... to Moebius...!" They force gathered their core power again. Purple electricity sparkles around their body, enshrouded by thick purple fog.  These thick purple cloud/fog blew towards the Ouroboros's direction, sending them covering their face. 

Eunie: "Oi, oi! Things are lookin' pretty snuffed up!"

Taion: "Noah, something's strange!"

O and P: "Iaaaaaaaahhhhhhh!" They step forward slowly, purple flames burning their feet, "Y-you'll never... get away with this! Neveeeeerrrrr!!! Ne... ne... ne...?" Then, an energy burst suddenly exploded from their core, sending shockwave into their vicinity. But they're still not dead; indeed, they're confused..."Wh- what's this light?! What's happening?! Wh-why can't we move?!" 

Taion: "The black fog?!" The black fog were being absorbed into their core. He was reminded of what they see in the desert, and the pond they swam/bathed in the desert. "No... the annihilation effect?!"

Noah: "What? Are you sure?!"

"Noah! We have to get away from them! **We have to retreat!**"

Sena: "**We're not gonna make it...!**"

Lanz quickly take control, "**OH, SHIT!!!**" And he raised a ring shield in front to shield them from the predicted incoming burst. 

Noah: "**Mio!**"

"I'm on it!" Mio's Ouroboros quickly dashed towards O and P. We could also see Taion took control of the Ouroboros, raising a Mondo shield. 

"Huh? Mio! What are you?"{{footnote: Is this from Lanz or from Taion?}}

As they jumped, they cancelled their Interlink, floated upwards slowly as if anti-gravity, and Noah drew out Lucky Seven. Holding out the handle towards Mio, he called, "This is it!"

She took hld of the long handle together with him, "It's the only... way!!!" Noah's wrapped the back of her hand which she put on the end of the handle. Together looking towards their target, "Hahhhhhhhhhhh!!!!" It... did not slice O and P into half. Instead, it poked itself into the ground in front of them. 

A moment later, the ground starts cracking, sending dust and debris where it poked , as O and P's platform detached from the main platform, and they could only watched themselves falling together with the platform into whatever ground below.{{footnote: It should be a ground, because one could see bonfire down below to Noah's right.}} 

Noah and Mio, seeing their success, quickly turned around and ran away from being trapped themselves. 

O and P: "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!" Some second after they fall, we see a green burst of light blindingly lighting up from below. 

Noah caught hold of Mio as they faced down, landed on the ground. Taion's and Lanz's quickly got behind them and put up shields to block the intense shockwaves (plus dust, debris, and smoke) sending their way. 

Looking down, it seems where they fall wasn't land; at least it's too tall the bottom area were covered with clouds. The green Annihilation ball carved out some shapes on the pillars of rocks before it died down, giant rocks swiveling around the Annihilation supposed center. 

As Mio and Noah slowly got up on their feet, the other two Ouroboros cancelled their Interlink and approached them slowly. Noah scanned the horizon, "Is it over...?"

Sena: "Are we... all in one piece?"

Lanz, scratching his head, "Yeah... Think I've got all my limbs attached."

Eunie was coughing furiously, "Queen's fingers, that was close!"

Taion was impressed, "Quite a snap decision there, Noah!"

He calmly replied, turning towards her, "That was Mio's doing. I'm very impressed!"

"It was easy. I do know how you think."

She wasn't cheered up. As she finished, she turned and walked towards the Ferronises, the group followed behind her. Both their flutes were held on their hands, reminisced for a moment, before they played the melody. Their first time with a different flute, eh! 

Blue motes rose from inside the Ferronises, spreaded around before rising into the air. From inside, we could see they were rising from their remaining clothes, even though they don't have corpses anymore. Tears overflowed from Mio's while she continued the melody.

(Night time, by a bonfire, camping beside a rocky wall).

Riku and Manana were fully asleep. The others sat by the bonfire as they chat. Lanz turned to him, sitting to his right, "Noah. Can I ask a weird question?"

"Sure."

"In that ceremony... You didn't send... 'them' off?"

His eyebrows raised a bit, "No, today's been a bit much. I'm only human."

"I know, right? Well then. That's a relief."

Mio, sitting beside Noah, commented, "It's wrong. That shouldn't be what gives our lives purpose. Wasn't there a different way? A better one?"

Lanz: "Those two... fought for their ideal..." Looking up as if they were turning to stars, watching at them{{footnote: Though we couldn't see any stars...}}, "Something more important than their lives."

Eunie: "Honor? Or pride?"

Taion: "Satisfaction, perhaps?" Shaking his head to reject his hypothesis, "No, that's wrong... Something we can't put into words."

Mio: "Yeah, but what? Can it really be that important?"

"I can't say..."

Sena asked, "Do you think they found it...? That... 'something'?"

Lanz: "Be nice if they did."

Noah: "You think so?" As they looked at him, whom was looking at the ground, "I just... Seems... so sad."

"Huh..." Mio breathed out at his remark. Altogether, they watched the sparks rose into the air from the bonfire, before dying down, their flames. 

---

The next morning. 

Lanz, Eunie, Sena, and Taion gathered around chatting. Riku was trying to wake up Manana. Mio walked towards Noah, whom was practicing his sword a distance away. In the background, we could see a fallen building, it's beam seems so strong it doesn't break even when laying slanted horizontally. Below it were the Ferronises. 

As he finished his moves, sheathing his blades, he heard footsteps coming from behind, turned and asked, "Sleep well?"

"Yeah... Well, sort of."

"Well... Your eyes are red."

"Hey, shut up... So what if they are?" She gave him a poke in his forehead, turned in the other direction, while he kept a hand covering where she poked. "But... I know what I have to do." Turning back to him, "Everything's so... clear now."

"Same here."

"We'd better hurry. After all... the threat's not gone."

"Yeah. That's true. _Heh..._"

"Hm?"

In an uplifting tone, "You surprised me." Then, he showed it by punching himself in his cheek.{{footnote: Perhaps that's her foot at P's face he meant?}} She could only scratched her head. 

She replied, "You did too. I... I didn't think you were the sort to take such a stand."

"Sometimes, we're left with no other choice."

"Mmm... Yeah! I think you're right! Absolutely right." Then, she turned to look at the Ferronises. He followed her glance, before she asked, "What do we do about... Ethel?"

"When things are settled, we'll let Colony 4 know. It's what she'd want. I'm certain of it."

"Yeah, you're right. She'd be... happy." As she finished, they turned and walk towards the group, where they camped. The others were finished chatting, looking at them returning.
