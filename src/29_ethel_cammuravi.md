# Ethel and Cammuravi,

Continuing their journey on some barren war-torn land, Mio's ears fluttered as she heard something, alerting the others, "What's that sound?!" 

To describe the environment, behind them, they just descended from a slanted platform. There were trees and some grass to the side. Turning to their right, where the booming sound echoed louder, stood a giant boulder taller than the trees. To its right stood the old building structure. To its left, we could see the Castle's silhouette (still) in the distance, plus some other trees and rocks. 

Looking up, they saw Ethel's and Cammuravi's Ferronises standing atop the boulder.

Noah exclaimed, "Ferronises!" The Ferronises took a few steps forward before gently dropping onto the ground in front of them, sending dust blowing in their direction; they were forced to face sideways to shield against them entering their eyes. As they cleared, the group watched the Ferronises "unbent" their knees. 

From within, Ethel voice echoed via an invisible speaker towards the group, "I told you life is short, but I didn't mean it like this! Noah, Mio."

Noah: "That voice... Ethel?!" To prove his prediction, Ethel climbed out of her Ferronis, stood on top of it. Noah then turned to the fiery Ferronis, "Ethel... But then who's the other one?"

Sena: "That one? It's from Agnus, right?"

Taion: "I recognize the crescent moon crest... Cammuravi's piloting that thing." Cammuravi also climbed out of his Ferronis to show his face, standing in front of the Ferronis's head. 

Noah: "Cammuravi... That's him... Ethel's sworn rival..."

Mio: "But why? How did they get them to work together?"{{footnote: Borealis already brought the news? Unsure why they felt so shocked when they themselves are working together... And they know Ethel and Cammuravi's stories anyways; if she didn't kill him, it's not too difficult to understand they could work together.}}

As they were thinking, P sounded as she and O teleported in front of the Ferronises, "Flitting like moths... to a flame. N's predictions are nothing to be sniffed at. Gotta hand it to him."

Lanz: "Urghhh... Anyone else wanna show up?"

Noah was more concerned with the new moebius she introduced to them,  "N?"

"Hehhhhh...." Putting his arms on his waist, O commented, "I'm afraid this is about as far as you go. Terribly sorry, chums!"

Sena remarked, "I know who he is. He's the Consul from Colony Zeta! I remember him from a... joint operation."

Eunie guessed, "Then I guess this one's meant to be... from our side then, is she? Never seen her before."

Lanz: "Probably. So the Consuls are colludin' as well? Something's really starting to smell."

Taion: "I concur."

Ethel continued, her voice loud and clear, "I thought that my message to you was crystal clear."

Noah exited his defensive stance as he replied, "Yes, we heard you."

Mio added: "That's why we're here!"

She closed her eyes, "Hm. I thought so." Reopening it, "I had a hunch that this would be the path Ouroboros chose to follow."

Noah: "I don't suppose... you'll step aside for us?"

"Wishful thinking. Give it up." She turned as she re-entered her Ferronis. Cammuravi spoke no words and followed after her the same action. 

"Well, then... We'll do whatever it takes." Together with Mio: "For the Greater Good!" And they both withdrew their weapons. Not the others, though. 

Ethel, from inside her Ferronis, swung her dual blades as she replied, "Well spoken! Then I say the same to you!" The dual blades of her Ferronis glowed in cyan after she activated the blades. 

Cammuravi spoke for the first time, "Off-seers from Keves and Agnus... Fate binds us... I bear none of you ill will, but my Way demands we fight!" Pointing his lance at them, inside and outside, flares burning from the tip of the lance, releasing sparks, "Come then... and test your mettle against my lance!"

Sena: "You've gotta be joking!" The group _still_ haven't called their weapons yet! 

Eunie never stop complaining when she sees the chance, "Mudder! I'm not testing anything against that! What happened to fighting fair?!"

Taion logically replied to her, "We won't get anywhere complaining! Ready yourself, Eunie!"

"Ready, he says..." She took a look at Mio whom was to her 10 o'clock, whom was focusing on Ethel and Cammuravi. Perhaps remembering their conversations earlier below the Bright Fig tree? Then she exclaimed, "From the moment I chose this muddy path, I've been **more than ready**!"

Taion had the time to stood up and pushed his glasses, "Hah! Oh, I know."

Eunie turned to him in, angry eyed, "Then whatcha say it for? Arsehole!"

Lanz stopped them from continuing their drama, withdrawing his blades as he shouted to them, "Zip it, guys. Get ready! They're here!" The others followed with calling their blades after him.

Noah's Ouroboros dashed quickly as he sliced his sword towards the Ferronis; as usual, their Ouroboros, despite larger in size, weren't comparable to the size of the Ferronis. A small ant-sized sword met with Ethel's dual blades. Ethel sliced on the ground just as they dashed forward, evading her slices. 

"Whoa! How is it so... fast? Can't find any way to... get inside!" Noah sounded. Despite being huge, Ethel wielded her sword much quicker than him; he could only shield her blows as she don't let him breathe. 

Ethel wasn't easy either. "The joints... Their sheer power really is something to behold..." The Ferronis joints sparkles with electricity as it tries to withstand the Ouroboros's blows. From the screen she saw, with red lights blinking to signify danger, a triangle targeting mechanism was trying to lock on Noah's Ouroboros. "Noah... Mio..."

"Urrrrrrahhhhhh..." Meanwhile, Lanz's Ouroboros was dashing towards Cammuravi's Ferronis, jumping from his strike and landed a punch on top of its head. A ring (from an art) appeared in front of it and released some beams on its face. Cammuravi's backed up a few steps before turning its lance in circles, deflecting any 'bullets' fired at it. 

Eunie's sounded from inside her Ouroboros, herself gliding through the air, "Gah! No good, eh?"

She quickly jumped up as Cammuravi's lance strike her previous position, before landing in front of it. Cammuravi praised, "Good coordination. I'd be done for, if it weren't for this Ferronis."

While she dodged another blow, she remarked, "Thanks for the **compliment!**" 

As Lanz's dropped to the ground, Sena took over and ran with her hammer at Cammuravi's, while he was busy attacking Eunie's. Taion's took over before a being struck, splitting into Mondos. As Ethel's and Cammuravi's were near each other, the three Ouroboroses were swapping their opponent all the time. 

After a few moments of complicated exchanges they made, Taion sounded, "Noah." Their fights never stop while they talked. 

"What is it?"

"I think this is the decider. OK... Let's do it."

"Yeah... We've got this." He dragged backwards before launching himself at the Ferronises again. 

Meanwhile, O and P, watching in the distance, P lost her patience, stomped one of her feet on the ground, "Come on, what are they playing at?!" O was sitting beside her on a protruding of a giant rock. "Am I crazy? We gave them Ferronises and everything! They had better not be holding back."

O: "You think they might be underestimating us? **Us** of all people?"

"Listen, O. Ethel's a lost cause. But Cammuravi... We could use him."

"Cammuravi? Hoh, I get what you're saying! You know, I forgot we even had that option!" He was getting excited as he stood up. "Hmm..." He put a 'frame' {{footnote: That's what picture-man or photo-man do, when they don't have a camera. They aimed their index finger and thumb 90Â° to each other into a gun shaped, and joined them so they shape like a frame.}} around their fighting scene. "Now, see the enemy before you? Use every last ounce of strength, and grind them to dust!" His left Iris glowed the Moebius strain as he spoke.

Suddenly, Cammuravi felt the headache as he groaned and dropped to the ground, one end of the lance on the floor and he knelt on one leg. Ethel was concerned, "What's wrong, Cammuravi?" 

From inside, we could see his iris continued to glow red as O's voice reverberate inside his head: "Look, you can see your enemy right there!"

"Enemy? Th-That is... My... Enemy...?" O make a glow around the Ouroboros that make them enshrouded in dark clouds, like the ones Ethel saw when they first met in the desert, except now it's Ouroboros form instead of humanoid form. As he changed to look at the different targets, "Enemy... Enemy! **Enemy!!!**"

"Cammuravi? What's wrong with you?! Cammuravi!" As if she thought of something, she gasped, "Oh no..." She saw what O was doing, "The Iris... I knew it. **Cammuravi!**"

"Urrrrrrrrahhhhh!!!" Cammuravi's Ferronis pointed the lance high on the high; he dug out his left Iris{{footnote: With his two fingers, of course, to add in the details!}} As he breathed swiftly, we could see he closed his left eye, dark blood leaked from it to his chin. He didn't subside, remarked, "This is... I am... I am **under no one's yoke**!"

Ethel was shocked by his actions, her eyes wide opened, "Cammuravi, you... you really... Your own eye..."

"I will be as they are! I am... **I am free**!" He exclaimed as he pointed his lance forward. 

That incurred Ethel's thoughts on the topic, "Free...You're right... We're free! **Free! The two of us!**"

Noah was confused, they could hear her speech, "What are you saying? Ethel, what's...?"

Cammuravi draw Ethel's attention instead, "Attend, Ethel!"

She tacitly knew what they wanted, "Yes! Our dream will not perish!" Both Ferronis ran further from each other, turned towards each other, and started fencing each other. Their fights from before had continued. 

Lanz was equally confused, "Uh? What the snuff's going on?!"

Taion: "Are the Consuls doing this?!" They stood while they watched them fenced each other. 

Mio was the first to link the dots, "No! This is... It's what _they_ want!"

Ethel seconded her, fighting as she spoke, "Absolutely right, Mio!"

"Ethel?!"

"Ever since I met you all, I have admired you!"

"Admired us?!"

Her voice sounded on the verge of tears, perhaps the tears of freedom, "Your freedom! I bless the fortune I have had... in meeting all of you! You have... my gratitude!"

Noah: "Gratitude?"

Cammuravi explained, "This feeling of elation... Liberating, is it not?"

"I feel it too, Cammuravi!"

P was confused and angry at the situation, stomping her feet, "Wh- what are they fighting each other for?! O?" 

O's hands was shaking, his Iris still glowing, as he tried to make sense of the situation that lost control, his voice reverberating as he replied, "Uhh... I-I can't believe this! He... He won't listen to any of my commands!"

Noah, enshrouded in dust from their fighting, shouted, didn't understand, "Ethel! Why in flames do you have to fight each other?! We're supposed to be your enemies."

"I told you, Noah. Observe. This here is the purpose of my life! Just know... You were the ones who finally opened my eyes!"

P sniped [use a different word?] at them, "Stop this! Stop it this instant! Ethel! Cammuravi! Uhhh!!! In that case...!" She activated her iris as lives were drawing away from their Flame Clock. 

Sena: "Their Flame Clocks!!!"

Taion noticed more colliding [what is the correct word?] information, "This is weird! Look at the way the light is moving!"

"Is that... Is that their life force we're seeing?" Inside their chamber, Ethel's and Cammuravi's 'life' were escaping from their body. 

P saw this doesn't stop them, continuingly shouted, "**Have you gone completely insane? You were supposed to kill Ouroboros!** *So stop this senseless fighting and obliterate those brats!*" Then changed to a threatening tone, "If you don't... I'll take your precious little life, and drain it dry!" She clenched her fist in front of her, as if to squash their hearts. 

Eunie: "Wha- Did you hear that?!"

Noah: "I knew it. So they really can drain their life! **Ethel! Cammuravi!**"

Taion: "Noah! We have to kill the Consuls!" 

"You're right!" He made his dash towards O and P when Ethel stopped them with her (Ferronis's) feet, sounding from inside, 

"It's OK, Noah... It's _over_ for us now."

"That's rubbish! Ethel!" He tried to convince her to stop. 

Mio: "This is wrong. All of this is wrong! There's no reason for you two to be fighting each other!"

Ethel: "Ugh! You might not understand now, but someday you will. This is what I... This is what, _both_ of us want!"

Noah's took a few steps forward as he questioned, "How can... How can any of this be what you want?! **You're both gonna die!**"

They had been in this stance for quite a long time, Ethel shielding Cammuravi's lance from pressing down at her. "What we leave you is more important! All our aspirations... You must keep them in your hearts! You must take them... Make it all mean something! You have to live..." She break through the attack, fencing back. "**You must live on!**"

As they split a few distance away, Ethel crossed her sword into a plus (+) shape, for a final round, "Here I come, Cammuravi!"

"Let us cross blades, one last time!" Then, they shouted at each other as they don't defend, let each other's blades strikes into their Flame Clock. From inside, they turned into 'life' as they elatedly felt fulfilled, immediately their corpses gone, leaving only their shirt and belongings dropped to the ground (of the control center). 

Mio: "**Ethellll!!!**" The group watched their lives floated away from the Ferronis into the sky. "Huh... Ethel..." She and Noah cancelled their Interlink. 

P complained, as she and O took steps forward, decided its their turn to take the stage, "Tsk. Well, didn't they come in handy? What was N thinking, picking those reckless hotheads?"

O: "Hmm... Good grief. Looks like... we're just gonna have to wipe out this lot ourselves!"

Mio and Noah looked at them angrily, him sniping at them, "You scumbags..." 

P: "Fine then. I did expect something like this. Time for Plan B. Interlinking... You've been blessed with quite the talent. You feel special?"

Noah: "What now?" The others had also cancelled their Interlink as they joined beside Noah and Mio.

"I do hate to burst your bubble... but I'm afraid it's not just an Ouroboros thing. O?"

"I'm ready when you are! Hah!"

"Then... shall we?" Both transformed into their Moebius form, P with several knife-shape blades that made up a wing like a bird, a ring circled around her neck, and a crest like that of a chicken. O is a buff Moebius, with a ring around its very thin waist.
