# Juniper

> **Translator's note on environment:** Tall modern looking buildings, glass shattered, some toppled, not maintained for a very long time. On a platform; or perhaps, a balcony, we could see some ferns growing, and goats too! Some were even infested by giant trees that engulfed them within! Tiles covered some part of the floor where animals like cobra, rattlesnake, and more goats roamed. Where there was a hole, water filled, turning it into a pond. Vines dangled along two ends where they grew. This, is **High Maktha Wildwood**, of Pentelas Region.

The group arrived at the very top overlooking the dilapidated nature-looking scene. Behind and around, there were more old buildings; but their walls had already fallen apart in the direction they're looking towards. 

After a moment of silence, Eunie folded her arms and complaint, "Man, those Moebius mooks... They make my feathers stand on end. Ending peoples' lives like it doesn't matter. Urgh. What a sick joke."

Riku: "There word for people like that. Know what Nopon say?"

Sena: "No idea. Tell us?"

"'Supervillainpon'."

Noah: "Riku, what does that mean, then?"

"It mean extreme bad guy."

"Ahh, I think I get it." Say it like never being said. 

"Meh-meh...?" Even Manana was confused; or perhaps, she had a questions for them?

"Wassup, Manana?" Eunie asked. 

"Then, are Noah and Mio and friends... supervillainpon?" Her eyes dingled with stars.

Lanz: "You're labeling us?" 

"Labeling. Because friends used to end lives also!"

"Urgh!" That makes Eunie realized. 

"That not make them supervillainpon?"

Eunie tried to explain, "I mean... It's not like we ever had a choice or anything. It was them or us." 

"So when no choice, not fall under definition then?"

Lanz: "None of us ever fought 'cause we wanted to. It's just how it worked. How people worked, and the world."

"So... World is supervillainpon!"

"Whuh?!"

"Since it make everyone do nasty things! World is bad guy!" The is a paradigm shift, from thinking of bad individuals, to a bad world. 

Noah considered the statement, "The world is... bad? Huh! I never thought of it like that!"

Lanz, in a sorrowful tone, "Now that you mention it, what in the world are we even here for?" The rest of the group were deep in sorrow too, caught by her statement, lost their direction. 

As they thought about it for a moment, Taion broke the silence, getting into his thinking mode, "I wouldn't strain your brain too much."

Lanz snapped back unconsciously, "Sounds like _you_ have."

"What gave you that idea?"

"Cut the snark, just tell me!"

"The end-point of it is... suicide."

"Say what?" 

"If you don't want to hurt others, you'll end up denying your own right to survive. Eventually, you come to the conclusion that the world may well be better off without your presence. The only resolution then, is to erase the self. To die." Then, looking to Lanz, "See? Pointless."

"Isn't that taking it too far?"

Noah seemingly disagreed with Taion, "The world doesn't just vanish because you've closed your eyes."

Taion prompted deeper, "What...?"

"The moon..." They turned to face the sky, he continued, "Think about it. Why is it that the moon shines? Just because we're watching?"{{footnote: Well, think about it. If Earth were to split into half, did the moon also split into half? If the two halves of the Earth, eons later, were to come together and formed Aionios, were the two halves of the moon come together 'perfectly' joined, and formed a circular moon? When they split, do each half of Earth gets each half of the Moon? Do they crush under gravity and changed back to a spherical shape? Now think about it...}} There was a moon{{footnote: Could be seen in first video clearly, but second video, due to clouds, not really, until the clouds blew away.}} up in the sky where they looked, a tall broken building below it, and some trees, and a finger-like rocky structure to the right. "Of course not. Even if humans were gone, it would shine on, illuminating the land beneath. And yet... **We're the ones that give meaning to it**. We say 'bit dim tonight,' or.. 'Looks brighter than usual, eh?' Similarly, we can now imbue the world with meaning, or change it. It's a privilege we were lucky to obtain."

Mio turned to face him, questioned, "And that's... the power of Ouroboros?" The others followed their glance. He looked at her eyes, nodded in return. 

"We're obliged to use it. We can make a difference."

"So we don't become supervillains?" 

"That's one thing to aim for, at least. Right?" He turned to face Manana, Mio followed his glance. Manana was fluttering her wings.

After the group descended some staircase, Lanz felt something not right, "Hey... You sure we're going the right way, guys?" The group turned to him. 

Sena looked at the path in front; overgrown buildings, at the end, it seems like there's no path to the other side{{footnote: Actually, you have to slide on the rope, seeing from retrospect.}}. "Mmm... Well, it's a path, at least..."

Noah: "Looks like it's going to be real pain getting through here."

Taion agreed, "True. But we don't have the luxury of loitering."

Eunie: "Well, I don't see any other road to take. So, let's just get this over with." She took the lead as they watched her walk for a while before following. 

Suddenly, someone slid on a rope and jumped up high, shooting three green  arrows at them. Mio's ears first heard the arrow sliced through the air, shouted, "...?! Eunie, look out!" She quickly dashed towards her, hugged her as they went to the ground together. Eunie saw the arrows landed at where she originally stood as they fell on the floor. Then, the arrow exploded. 

"Waaugh?!" Eunie backed up in agony. Looking up, she saw the female, green hair, turquoise iris, pointing her bow at her. As she got up, she drew her blades and shot at her, whom was standing above a beam. She jumped and landed in front of the group. More Agnian soldiers landed beside and behind her. 

Lanz was flabbergasted, shouted, "Wha-What the?! An ambush?!"

Seeing her raised her bows at them, Noah immediately reacted by shouting to the group, "Ah?! Weapons, quick!"

---

(After the fight.)

**Juniper** sighed as she saw the group sheathed their blades. 

Noah shouted to the group, "We just want to pass through! We're not looking for trouble!" 

Sena added, "C'mon guys, what's your problem?"

One of her teammates, male, brown skin, buff, shouted, "Juniper! Imogen's at her limit! She can't keep going!" His name's Carson. 

Noah: "Huh?"

Another neck-long hair, pale skin, yellow iris, pointed chin, "Spark... And we could've had their life, too... So close!"

Noah: "...Ah!"

Juniper: "That's very unfortunate. We'll have to retreat, then." Then, they ran off in the distance. 

Lanz complained at the confusing situation, "What was all that about? Weirdos."

Seeing that Noah was thinking about the situation, Taion asked for more information, "Noah? What's wrong?"

He turned to face him, shook his head, "I was just thinking..."

Getting to his thinking stance, "About the archer? They seemed quite the formidable opponent, to be sure..."

Folding his arms, "That's true, but there was something else about them..." They seemed to be just high enough in altitude to see clouds floating around them sparingly. {{footnote: Before, they were too high to see clouds below them, just like you usually see clouds below you when you boarded an airplane; and those clouds that were taller than where your plane flies were relatively rarer than the cloud sea below, provided you were flying past cloudy zones.}}

Mio seemed to connect with him, "Say, you don't think...?"

"Those soldiers' Flame Clocks, they might be getting low..."

Taion wasn't enthused, folding his arms, "Oh, come on, Noah. You'd better not be thinking of offering your assistance..."

"It's... hard to put into words, but... something's off."

"And you think we have time to be traipsing around on this whim of yours?"

Sena lightly added, "It really bothers you?"

He nodded, "Yeah."

Eunie knows more how he acts, teased, "Give it up, Taion. Once Noah's like this, there's no stopping him." That's him in the battlefield always missing the transporting levnises, eh! 

"Whuh why do I bother?" 

Lanz added, "Besides, Noah's intuition's usually pretty on the mark."

Sena agreed with him, "We could just take a look... A-a tiny little peek?"

"Pfft... Fine. I can see no amount of reasoning is going to dissuade you. However, if it turns out to be nothing, we head straight back and move on. Acceptable?"

He agreed and shouted to the group, "That's fine. OK, let's move. We should be able to catch up to them if we follow their tracks."

---

Along another part of the abandoned building, we could see a long walkway in the distance, but the group was looking at a mechanism with three steps up, and a rope that connected it to the platform on the other side. We could also see several trees growing on the other side of the platform, and perhaps some flowers or small animals, the translator can't make do its form given its relatively small size in the distant, on the pathway on their current pathway. 

Taion: "Judging by how the tracks stop here, it seems that this is where those soldiers passed through."

Sena: "Through here? But... how?"
