# Juniper

===

> **Translator's note on environment:** Tall modern looking buildings, glass shattered, some toppled, not maintained for a very long time. On a platform; or perhaps, a balcony, we could see some ferns growing, and goats too! Some were even infested by giant trees that engulfed them within! Tiles covered some part of the floor where animals like cobra, rattlesnake, and more goats roamed. Where there was a hole, water filled, turning it into a pond. Vines dangled along two ends where they grew. This, is **High Maktha Wildwood**, of Pentelas Region. 

---

The group arrived at the very top overlooking the dilapidated nature-looking scene. Behind and around, there were more old buildings; but their walls had already fallen apart in the direction they're looking towards. 

After a moment of silence, Eunie folded her arms and complaint, "Man, those Moebius mooks... They make my feathers stand on end. Ending peoples' lives like it doesn't matter. Urgh. What a sick joke."

Riku: "There word for people like that. Know what Nopon say?"

Sena: "No idea. Tell us?"

"'Supervillainpon'."

Noah: "Riku, what does that mean, then?"

"It mean extreme bad guy."

"Ahh, I think I get it." Say it like never being said. 

"Meh-meh...?" Even Manana was confused; or perhaps, she had a questions for them?

"Wassup, Manana?" Eunie asked. 

"Then, are Noah and Mio and friends... supervillainpon?" Her eyes dingled with stars.

Lanz: "You're labeling us?" 

"Labeling. Because friends used to end lives also!"

"Urgh!" That makes Eunie realized. 

"That not make them supervillainpon?"

Eunie tried to explain, "I mean... It's not like we ever had a choice or anything. It was them or us." 

"So when no choice, not fall under definition then?"

Lanz: "None of us ever fought 'cause we wanted to. It's just how it worked. How people worked, and the world."

"So... World is supervillainpon!"

"Whuh?!"

"Since it make everyone do nasty things! World is bad guy!" The is a paradigm shift, from thinking of bad individuals, to a bad world. 

Noah considered the statement, "The world is... bad? Huh! I never thought of it like that!"

Lanz, in a sorrowful tone, "Now that you mention it, what in the world are we even here for?" The rest of the group were deep in sorrow too, caught by her statement, lost their direction. 

As they thought about it for a moment, Taion broke the silence, getting into his thinking mode, "I wouldn't strain your brain too much."

Lanz snapped back unconsciously, "Sounds like _you_ have."

"What gave you that idea?"

"Cut the snark, just tell me!"

"The end-point of it is... suicide."

"Say what?" 

"If you don't want to hurt others, you'll end up denying your own right to survive. Eventually, you come to the conclusion that the world may well be better off without your presence. The only resolution then, is to erase the self. To die." Then, looking to Lanz, "See? Pointless."

"Isn't that taking it too far?"

Noah seemingly disagreed with Taion, "The world doesn't just vanish because you've closed your eyes."

Taion prompted deeper, "What...?"

"The moon..." They turned to face the sky, he continued, "Think about it. Why is it that the moon shines? Just because we're watching?"{{footnote: Well, think about it. If Earth were to split into half, did the moon also split into half? If the two halves of the Earth, eons later, were to come together and formed Aionios, were the two halves of the moon come together 'perfectly' joined, and formed a circular moon? When they split, do each half of Earth gets each half of the Moon? Do they crush under gravity and changed back to a spherical shape? Now think about it...}} There was a moon{{footnote: Could be seen in first video clearly, but second video, due to clouds, not really, until the clouds blew away.}} up in the sky where they looked, a tall broken building below it, and some trees, and a finger-like rocky structure to the right. "Of course not. Even if humans were gone, it would shine on, illuminating the land beneath. And yet... **We're the ones that give meaning to it**. We say 'bit dim tonight,' or.. 'Looks brighter than usual, eh?' Similarly, we can now imbue the world with meaning, or change it. It's a privilege we were lucky to obtain."

Mio turned to face him, questioned, "And that's... the power of Ouroboros?" The others followed their glance. He looked at her eyes, nodded in return. 

"We're obliged to use it. We can make a difference."

"So we don't become supervillains?" 

"That's one thing to aim for, at least. Right?" He turned to face Manana, Mio followed his glance. Manana was fluttering her wings. 

---

After the group descended some staircase, Lanz felt something not right, "Hey... You sure we're going the right way, guys?" The group turned to him. 

Sena looked at the path in front; overgrown buildings, at the end, it seems like there's no path to the other side{{footnote: Actually, you have to slide on the rope, seeing from retrospect.}}. "Mmm... Well, it's a path, at least..."

Noah: "Looks like it's going to be real pain getting through here."

Taion agreed, "True. But we don't have the luxury of loitering."

Eunie: "Well, I don't see any other road to take. So, let's just get this over with." She took the lead as they watched her walk for a while before following. 

Suddenly, someone slid on a rope and jumped up high, shooting three green  arrows at them. Mio's ears first heard the arrow sliced through the air, shouted, "...?! Eunie, look out!" She quickly dashed towards her, hugged her as they went to the ground together. Eunie saw the arrows landed at where she originally stood as they fell on the floor. Then, the arrow exploded. 

"Waaugh?!" Eunie backed up in agony. Looking up, she saw the female, green hair, turquoise iris, pointing her bow at her. As she got up, she drew her blades and shot at her, whom was standing above a beam. She jumped and landed in front of the group. More Agnian soldiers landed beside and behind her. 

Lanz was flabbergasted, shouted, "Wha-What the?! An ambush?!"

Seeing her raised her bows at them, Noah immediately reacted by shouting to the group, "Ah?! Weapons, quick!"

---

(After the fight.)

**Juniper** sighed as she saw the group sheathed their blades. 

Noah shouted to the group, "We just want to pass through! We're not looking for trouble!" 

Sena added, "C'mon guys, what's your problem?"

One of her teammates, male, brown skin, buff, shouted, "Juniper! Imogen's at her limit! She can't keep going!" His name's Carson. 

Noah: "Huh?"

Another neck-long hair, pale skin, yellow iris, pointed chin, "Spark... And we could've had their life, too... So close!"

Noah: "...Ah!"

Juniper: "That's very unfortunate. We'll have to retreat, then." Then, they ran off in the distance. 

Lanz complained at the confusing situation, "What was all that about? Weirdos."

Seeing that Noah was thinking about the situation, Taion asked for more information, "Noah? What's wrong?"

He turned to face him, shook his head, "I was just thinking..."

Getting to his thinking stance, "About the archer? They seemed quite the formidable opponent, to be sure..."

Folding his arms, "That's true, but there was something else about them..." They seemed to be just high enough in altitude to see clouds floating around them sparingly. {{footnote: Before, they were too high to see clouds below them, just like you usually see clouds below you when you boarded an airplane; and those clouds that were taller than where your plane flies were relatively rarer than the cloud sea below, provided you were flying past cloudy zones.}}

Mio seemed to connect with him, "Say, you don't think...?"

"Those soldiers' Flame Clocks, they might be getting low..."

Taion wasn't enthused, folding his arms, "Oh, come on, Noah. You'd better not be thinking of offering your assistance..."

"It's... hard to put into words, but... something's off."

"And you think we have time to be traipsing around on this whim of yours?"

Sena lightly added, "It really bothers you?"

He nodded, "Yeah."

Eunie knows more how he acts, teased, "Give it up, Taion. Once Noah's like this, there's no stopping him." That's him in the battlefield always missing the transporting levnises, eh! 

"Whuh why do I bother?" 

Lanz added, "Besides, Noah's intuition's usually pretty on the mark."

Sena agreed with him, "We could just take a look... A-a tiny little peek?"

"Pfft... Fine. I can see no amount of reasoning is going to dissuade you. However, if it turns out to be nothing, we head straight back and move on. Acceptable?"

He agreed and shouted to the group, "That's fine. OK, let's move. We should be able to catch up to them if we follow their tracks."

---

Along another part of the abandoned building, we could see a long walkway in the distance, but the group was looking at a mechanism with three steps up, and a rope that connected it to the platform on the other side. We could also see several trees growing on the other side of the platform, and perhaps some flowers or small animals, the translator can't make do its form given its relatively small size in the distant, on the pathway on their current pathway. 

Taion: "Judging by how the tracks stop here, it seems that this is where those soldiers passed through."

Sena: "Through here? But... how?"

Noah nodded, "Hmm. Doesn't look easily traversable, does it?"

Lanz agreed, "Yeah, I can't see us getting across there any time soon..."

Taion suggested, "We could always took a detour. Look, this way." Unsure where he's pointing to, perhaps the path on the right? 

Noah: "Yeah. Thanks, Taion."

"Like I said, we can't afford to be hanging around here. Come on, we haven't got all day."

---

As night came, they look up a slope with walls to one side and saw an Agnian Ferronis parked in the distance. 

Sena: "...This is crazy. There-there was a colony, here?!" 

Just as she finished, Juniper was walking down the slope. She wasn't aggressive as earlier, explaining to them instead, "That's right. This is an abandoned colony."

Noah shouted back, "Please listen to us! We didn't come here to fight you!"

"Mmm..."

"We can free you from your Flame Clock."

"...Free us?" That caught her attention. 

Folding his arms, "You don't have much time left on yours, do you? We can help you with that, so if you'd just-"

She finished his sentence, "Stop attacking you?"

"Yeah..."

"Mmm..." Then, she nodded, considering the situation couldn't be much worse, "All right. I'll hear you out."

"...Ah... thank you!"

"Please, come in."

Taion quietly whispered and warned the group, "They're still wary of us. We can't let our guard down."

---

Below in front of the Ferronis, the group assessed the Ferronis. Taion, folding his arms, exclaimed, "I've seen a few colonies with dwindling Flame Clocks before, but this one is especially bizarre..."

Noah added, "It's like they're not trying to survive here at all... Do you get that impression?"

Around the walls carved their colony. There were huts built sparsely next to each other, lighting the night with a fire on top of a pot held high instead of street lamps. Just at the platform below the Ferronis, there was a canteen (Translator think), but with only one table. Taion continued, "Back when I was stationed at Lambda, I'd heard rumors about Colony Tau."

Mio was curious, "What did they say?"

"That deep in the forest, there's a colony with some very peculiar customs and traditions. This is my first time seeing it in reality, but I never expected it to be so run-down..."

Sena: "Did you have any dealings with it?"

"None at all. This is just hearsay from Commander Isurd."

Noah: "Anyway, we should hurry. Let's smash the Flame Clock and free everyone."

Just as he finished, Juniper and one of her companion approached the group. The follower had crystals grown around the earlobes, darker skin, and lines representing those of Isurd from his temple down, and seen also on the back of his palm. They turned to face each other. 

Juniper explained their situation, "It being an abandoned colony, we are continually starved of sufficient life sources."

Noah: "Wait... Are you the commander?"

"That's right. Sorry I failed to tell you before. I am Juniper, and it's my job to lead Colony Tau."

"If that's so, then surely you must know who we are."

She shook her head, "I'm afraid I know nothing."

Noah was surprised, or perhaps it explained why they attacked them in search of life forces. "...Huh."

"We have no need of such information."

The guy behind, Raine, explained, "Juniper told us we'd welcome you in, whoever you might turn out to be. So, that's the rule! We don't ask questions."

Eunie snapped back, "But you attacked us back there!"

He explained, "Our scouts told us about some monsters in the forest they'd never seen before, so, we sent them out on a hunt. But then they bumped into you en route. They must've figured it'd be more efficient to get you out of the way first."

Juniper then added, "Though, contrary to our plan, we were made to retreat."

Lanz asked, "Oh yeah, what about your Consul? Where are they hiding?"

"I told you, this is an abandoned colony. Our Consul rarely visits us."

Mio: "You're in such a strange situation..."

Noah was determined, "All the more reason to get you out of this predicament!"

Raine: "I think you guys are getting the wrong end of the stick here." 

Juniper breathe out forcefully, seemingly agreed, "It's true. We aren't afraid of Colony Tau's Flame Clock running out. All it means is the end of our days gazing at our ever-diminishing supply."

Noah didn't agree: "But you could die!"

Raine: "Uh-huh. As if we'd just let you waltz in and break our Flame Clock."

Juniper added, closing her eyes as she imagined the situation, "We all have to perish someday. If our lives should expire, then we'll sink into silence, darkness... oblivion." Opening her eyes back, she continued, "We'll return to the earth..."

"Huh..." Mio shook her head in disagreement. 

Noah still tried to prove his point, "Yes, but...! Y-you can't just...!"

Juniper cut him short, "The land will take us, and we will simply 'be'. That's how it is at Colony Tau. No one will ever think of us, and yet here we are. Slowly, but surely, we are withering. We don't always find the nutrition that we need to live. If Colony Tau cannot accumulate the vital flames it needs, then it proves only that we were too weak. And in nature, the weak are destined to perish."

Taion, folding his arms, rebutted, "Though logic would dictate that nature is pushing you to become stronger."

Lanz added, "If we set you free, you won't have to worry about all this crap."

Juniper: "We neither worry nor fear for what may come to pass."

Raine added, "We've already lost so many of our friends and allies. " Actually, what translator thought to be the canteen may be wrong. One saw canteen to the 8 o'clock of Raine, blanketed by the stars and clouds, lines of tables arranged in two rows. There were some 'drums'-like object arranged, unsure for what. The cafeteria that served the rations is behind the tables, under a tent, with various objects placed there, but one could only determine the tables. 

Juniper: "And every time, we returned their bodies to the earth. Such will be our fate."

Raine: "What's the point of fearing the inevitable? We know we're gonna die. What's wrong with us living the way we always have?"

Noah asked, "But how do you live without hope?"

Juniper answered his question, his tone was calm, "It will spell the end of the story that our predecessors weaved for generations... A tale cut short. I won't argue, that it feels a little *melancholy*... In that sense, if we were to be freed from the Flame Clock, then..."

Before she finished speaking, an Agnian soldier ran up and approached them. The group turned as the guy, Selin, shouted, "**JUNIPER! BAD NEWS!**"

"...Tell me."

"The monsters're coming straight for the colony! And they already took one of us down!"

"No... They came all the way here?!" They quickly ran off into the distance, Selin led the way. 

Noah shouted from behind, "We'll join you!"

---

(Just outside the colony, below the slope where the group stood overlooking the colony)

Juniper, Raine, and Seine arrived in front, shielding two other guys at the back, and one his body laid vertical on the floor. There were grass and some short coconut-like trees that pierced their roots and stems through the tiles into the mud/soil below. There were three rhinos like blue monsters, with armor plates attached behind their backs, and some protruding that shaped like a dimetrodon's fin.  

Juniper: "Ngh...!"

Raine shouted in emergency, "Juniper, we need orders!"

Juniper quickly sniped his words, "... This is perfectly fine. We'll defeat them, right here."

Noah and his groups just ran and joined them beside, "Juniper!"

"What are you...?"

Lanz: "Ask us later."

Noah nodded, "We'll back you up!"

"Thank you. I'll fight to the best of my abilities as well."

Noah shouted to the group, "Here we go!" Then, all withdrew their blades. 

---

(After the battle.)

Raine was checking on the guy whom was seriously injured lying on the floor, spoke with a relieved tone, "Geum's OK! He's still alive! Thank the flames..."

Juniper appreciated, "I'm so glad we made it in time... I'm so glad..." Then, turning to the group with her team, she directed to the group, "Again, accept my thanks. We couldn't have done this without you."

Noah, shaking his head, "Don't worry about it."

"Hah" Juniper breathed out a sigh of relief. "I suppose it's strange of me to talk about the laws of nature when I fear losing my friends."

"Not at all. Honestly, that seems like the most natural thing of all."

"When you told me that you would release us from the Flame Clock... I thought that... if you really were telling the truth, it would make life easier. But... at the same time, I began to hate the fact that I was looking for a way out. Looking up at our Clock, seeing the life ebbing away... I'd already accepted my fate. And letting go of that status quo, wretched though it was... After so long, I was scared of what might happen if we did."

Raine softly spoke her name as he heard her feelings, "Juniper..."

Juniper had a combination of exciting voice plus on-the-verge-of-tears tone, a combination of happiness and sadness into one, mixing seamlessly, "Noah, your words at the time seemed so appealing to me. I could not destroy the collective efforts that became the colony, and everything it represents, with my own two hands. But then _you_ said you would destroy it for us. **We'd be guilt-free**! If that isn't appealing... then what is?"

"You must've been aware of how tragic it is to simply await death. That's why you invited us, isn't it?"

Juniper shook her head, "Even now, I'm not afraid of dying." Pausing and changing where she faced slightly to the left, gestured to the guys beside and behind her, "But I hated the idea of losing those I hold dear... When I saw my friend lying there... I remembered what you told me, and, for a brief moment, *felt the grip of fear*." Then, closing her eyes, "I felt so weak, and helpless... yet at the same time, I didn't want to let go of my dear friend. So I must have closed myself off. I stopped thinking. Closed my eyes and covered my ears..." Opening her eyes back, "Perhaps I was simply... waiting for the inevitable release."

"Even so, we have to keep thinking."

Mio seconded him, "That's right -- ***even if there are things we'd rather not see, we still need to look***.{{footnote: Better face forward than stay in the location, because the latter would cause you to regret, the former, even if it failed, you won't regret for not even dare to try, at the very least.}}"

Noah continued, "And breaking out of your shell, scrambling in desperation for a way to escape despair? That's not what I call being weak. You've defended this place for so long. Why? Because you're strong. And once you're no longer shackled by the rules of the Flame Clock, you can accept a different reality... You can become stronger still. I know it." 

Juniper: "We can?"

He nodded in affirmation, "You can."

Mio added, "It won't be easy -- far from it. But we'll help you."

Raine called out from behind, and she turned to face him, "Juniper... It's your call."

Selin nodded in agreement, "We've made it this far thanks to you."

Juniper nodded, "Yes... I suppose so..." Signaling to the group, "*If*... there is a possibility that you can release us from the Clock, then... please."

Raine, in a more joking tone, "And if not, it's not like anything's changed."

That raised Juniper's mood, and she laughed in return, "Haha! Very true. If you can't break it, I can live with that too." Then, looking down, perhaps the idea seemed disappointing after giving them so much hope, "Nothing changes without a reason, without a cause." Looking back at the group, "Perhaps this event will teach me to see things in a new light..."

---

Noah and Mio facing the Colony Tau's Flame Clock, Noah shouted "Here we go!" as blue lights emblazoned their body, Ouroboros enlivened in their iris. Jumping up and canceling the Interlink, Noah sliced the Flame Clock from down to up himself, Mio fall back down before him. 'Lives' escaped it for a moment before dissipating, the 'left' part of the Flame Clock came crashing onto the ground. 

---

Juniper looked at the destroyed Flame Clock, shook her head, in a grateful tone, "I see acceptance is actually surprisingly easy, when it comes down to it."

Sena agreed with her, "I think it probably is, yeah."

Then, Juniper turned to the group, "Uhh... I'm sorry if this seems rude, but, could I ask another favor of you?"

Noah nodded in return, "Sure!"

"I'd like to learn much more of the world. Become a stronger individual. To that end, is there any chance I could accompany you?"

Lanz: "Whatdaya say, guys?"

Taion logically analyzed, "We could certainly do with someone of Juniper's caliber..."

Noah: "It'd be reassuring to have you on board. You're very welcome to join."

Eunie asked, "Is your colony gonna be OK, though? Can they get on without you?"

"Colony Tau needs to undergo change too. We need to extend our knowledge and grow." Then, she turned to his fellow Agnian colleagues and friends, while signaling back at Noah's group, "So I'd like you to take me on a trip. Somewhere far away... And show me something new."

Selin answered in excitement, "A... journey of discovery, huh? I guess that's another thing we need in order to grow."

Raine agreed too, suggested with an upbeat tone, hands on his waist, "Might be an idea to send some of our younger recruits out too. Could be a good lesson."

Juniper: "It's time to breathe new life into our colony. Let us break free from the chains that once bound us."

Raine shook his head, in a joking tone, "I guess I'm still hanging about, though. Can't have us all gallivanting about the place."

Lanz was still bothered with: "Your Consul really doesn't bother to show up, huh..."

Mio nodded in agreement, "Even after we broke the Flame Clock... You'd think they'd know."

Eunie enjoyed trouble-free: "Better this way, if you ask me."

Taion shook his head, "Still, we shouldn't rule out the possibility that they'll make trouble for you."

Noah, looking to Raine and the other Agnians, "If something happens, you tell us immediately, OK?"

The group look back, wavered, "Sure! Can do! We'll be counting on you."

Taion signaled the group for departure, hands crossed, "Well, we don't have all day. I think it's about time we made tracks, no?"

Noah agreed, "You're right. Time to move, then."

Juniper: "Well then, everyone..."

Before she could say anything, Raine jokingly assured her, "Ahhh, don't worry about us. You know we can handle ourselves."

Selin added from behind him, "We'll prove that Colony Tau... can be so. much. more!"

Juniper nodded, "Yes... I'm sure it will be."

Raine nudged, "Off you go then, skedaddle! The colony's staying right here, waiting for your return..."
