# Juniper

===

> **Translator's note on environment:** Tall modern looking buildings, glass shattered, some toppled, not maintained for a very long time. On a platform; or perhaps, a balcony, we could see some ferns growing, and goats too! Some were even infested by giant trees that engulfed them within! Tiles covered some part of the floor where animals like cobra, rattlesnake, and more goats roamed. Where there was a hole, water filled, turning it into a pond. Vines dangled along two ends where they grew. This, is **High Maktha Wildwood**, of Pentelas Region.

The group arrived at the very top overlooking the dilapidated nature-looking scene. Behind and around, there were more old buildings; but their walls had already fallen apart in the direction they're looking towards. 

After a moment of silence, Eunie folded her arms and complaint, "Man, those Moebius mooks... They make my feathers stand on end. Ending peoples' lives like it doesn't matter. Urgh. What a sick joke."

Riku: "There word for people like that. Know what Nopon say?"

Sena: "No idea. Tell us?"

"'Supervillainpon'."

Noah: "Riku, what does that mean, then?"

"It mean extreme bad guy."

"Ahh, I think I get it." Say it like never being said. 

"Meh-meh...?" Even Manana was confused; or perhaps, she had a questions for them?

"Wassup, Manana?" Eunie asked. 

"Then, are Noah and Mio and friends... supervillainpon?" Her eyes dingled with stars.

Lanz: "You're labeling us?" 

"Labeling. Because friends used to end lives also!"

"Urgh!" That makes Eunie realized. 

"That not make them supervillainpon?"

Eunie tried to explain, "I mean... It's not like we ever had a choice or anything. It was them or us." 

"So when no choice, not fall under definition then?"

Lanz: "None of us ever fought 'cause we wanted to. It's just how it worked. How people worked, and the world."

"So... World is supervillainpon!"

"Whuh?!"

"Since it make everyone do nasty things! World is bad guy!" The is a paradigm shift, from thinking of bad individuals, to a bad world. 

Noah considered the statement, "The world is... bad? Huh! I never thought of it like that!"

Lanz, in a sorrowful tone, "Now that you mention it, what in the world are we even here for?" The rest of the group were deep in sorrow too, caught by her statement, lost their direction. 

As they thought about it for a moment, Taion broke the silence, getting into his thinking mode, "I wouldn't strain your brain too much."

Lanz snapped back unconsciously, "Sounds like _you_ have."

"What gave you that idea?"

"Cut the snark, just tell me!"

"The end-point of it is... suicide."

"Say what?" 

"If you don't want to hurt others, you'll end up denying your own right to survive. Eventually, you come to the conclusion that the world may well be better off without your presence. The only resolution then, is to erase the self. To die." Then, looking to Lanz, "See? Pointless."

"Isn't that taking it too far?"

Noah seemingly disagreed with Taion, "The world doesn't just vanish because you've closed your eyes."

Taion prompted deeper, "What...?"

"The moon..." They turned to face the sky, he continued, "Think about it. Why is it that the moon shines? Just because we're watching?"{{footnote: Well, think about it. If Earth were to split into half, did the moon also split into half? If the two halves of the Earth, eons later, were to come together and formed Aionios, were the two halves of the moon come together 'perfectly' joined, and formed a circular moon? When they split, do each half of Earth gets each half of the Moon? Do they crush under gravity and changed back to a spherical shape? Now think about it...}} There was a moon{{footnote: Could be seen in first video clearly, but second video, due to clouds, not really, until the clouds blew away.}} up in the sky where they looked, a tall broken building below it, and some trees, and a finger-like rocky structure to the right. "Of course not. Even if humans were gone, it would shine on, illuminating the land beneath. And yet... **We're the ones that give meaning to it**. We say 'bit dim tonight,' or.. 'Looks brighter than usual, eh?' Similarly, we can now imbue the world with meaning, or change it. It's a privilege we were lucky to obtain."

Mio turned to face him, questioned, "And that's... the power of Ouroboros?" The others followed their glance. He looked at her eyes, nodded in return. 

"We're obliged to use it. We can make a difference."

"So we don't become supervillains?" 

"That's one thing to aim for, at least. Right?" He turned to face Manana, Mio followed his glance. Manana was fluttering her wings.
