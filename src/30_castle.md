# Hovering Reefs, Castle Infiltration

===

> **Translator's note on environment:** Behind the castle, the annihilator a distance from the hovering islands around the area. These islands were barren, paved with thin layer of grass, but mostly just dirt. Some rocks seemingly wind-eroded decorated the place. Bunnits and some crocodile-like raptors roamed the island in view. There was a stronghold on one of the island. A weird structure, like one for sacrificial purpose, was lifted on one of the small island. We could also see Laia, or flying stingrays, roaming the air. This, is **Syra Hovering Reefs**, of Keves Castle Region.

As the group entered the hovering reefs, Eunie conversing with Lanz, Mio with Noah, Riku with Manana, and Taion and Sena dropped last. Taion was looking at Mio unbeknownst to her; Sena started the conversation, drawing his attention, "I wonder... How do you think Ethel felt? Was that really what she wanted?"

"This is my personal opinion, but... **_Life's defined by moments. Your acts define you._**{{footnote: WOW! Well said!}} I think she found value in that. To achieve something in the limited time left to her, _one_ defining moment was what she chose."

She then looked at Mio, "You think Mimi... feels the same way?"

"I gave you my opinion. I'm sure Mio has her own thoughts on the matter." Then, looking down and feeling down, "Although, I know she doesn't have that much time left." But he gathered his will together, "_And hence_, my being here now."

"So... you've chosen your path."

In a quieter tone, "Until now I was afraid to take that first step. But now... I can do it."

"Man."

In a room, N, Joran (J), and the cow moebius (D) they first fought in Chapter 1 gathered together, looking outside the Castle's window, Joran asking, "You really think they'll come?"

N: "They'll come. You can count on it."

D: "Yeah? And then what? If you wanna give 'em a hug, you can count me out of it."

"I wanted to show something to 'Her Majesty'."

"Yeah? And what's that, then? I mean, she's not even-"

"She needs to be there to see how hope *dies*."

Joran: "What's this about now?"

N: "She *can* see it." He turned to his back, and the other two followed glance. The Queen stood in front of her throne. N continued, "'Her Majesty' occupies the same niche of existence as we do." Then, his Moebius Iris shone, D looked at him, trying to figure out any unspoken info.

The group stopped overlooking the stronghold entrance. There was no soldiers guarding the entrance. Noah announced, "Just past that gate, we'll find the Colony 11 garrison." We could see an array of floating buildings connecting towards the castle in an L shape, each quarters connected by bridges. Noah continued, "Beyond hat is a residential zone. From there, there's a road to the Castle's main gate."

Riku shook his head, "Gate penetration would not be easy. Expect huge battle."

"Yeah." Looking to his right, the group followed glance, "So we'll take a detour through the hovering reefs to the right and swing around behind the Castle. That's where we'll find the ether mine and freight entrance I mentioned." The islands were connected by ropes. 

Taion: "Understood. We shouldn't be hanging around here for long. Let's make for those 'reefs', as you called them."

"Good. **This way. Follow me.**" The group make their way towards the rope.
