# Hovering Reefs, Castle Infiltration

===

> **Translator's note on environment:** The surrounding below the annihilator stuffed with hovering islands, the latter paved with thin layer of grass, but mostly dirt. Wind-eroded rocks decorated the place. Bunnits and raptors{{footnote: Crocodiles?}} roamed the island. A stronghold stood still, connecting to the castle via bridges. Laia{{footnote: Flying stingrays}} roamed the clouds. A sacrificial altar structure at one of the small island we took note. This, is **Syra Hovering Reefs**, of Keves Castle Region. 

---

As the group entered the hovering reefs, Eunie conversing with Lanz, Mio with Noah, Riku with Manana, with Taion and Sena dropped last. Taion was looking at Mio, unbeknownst to her, perhaps thinking about the time she had left, or her legacy, when Sena started a conversation, "I wonder... How do you think Ethel felt? Was that really what she wanted?"

"This is my personal opinion, but... **_Life's defined by moments. Your acts define you._**{{footnote: WOW! Well said!}} I think she found value in that! To achieve something in the limited time left to her, _one_ defining moment was what she chose."

She then looked at Mio, "You think Mimi... feels the same way?"

"I gave you my opinion. I'm sure Mio has her own thoughts on the matter." Then, looking down and feeling down, "Although, I know she doesn't have that much time left." But he gathered his will together, "_And hence_, my being here now."

"So... you've chosen your path."

In a quieter tone, "Until now I was afraid to take that first step. But now... I can do it."

"Man."

---

In a room, N, Joran (J), and the cow moebius (D) gathered together, looking outside the Castle's window, Joran asking, "You really think they'll come?"

N: "They'll come. You can count on it."

D: "Yeah? And then what? If you wanna give 'em a hug, you can count me out of it."

"I wanted to show something to 'Her Majesty'."

"Yeah? And what's that, then? I mean, she's not even-..."

"She needs to be there to see how hope *dies*."

Joran: "What's this about now?"

N: "She *can* see it." He turned to his back, and the other two followed glance. The Queen stood in front of her throne. N continued, "'Her Majesty' occupies the same niche of existence as we do." Then, his Moebius Iris shone, D looked at him, trying to figure out any unspoken info. 

---

The group stopped overlooking the stronghold entrance. No soldiers were garrisoning the entrance. Noah told the group, "Just past that gate, we'll find the Colony 11 garrison." An array of floating buildings, supported by floating islands, connecting towards the castle via bridges in an L shape, until it reaches the Castle's entrance. He continued, "Beyond hat is a residential zone. From there, there's a road to the Castle's main gate."

Riku shook his head, "Gate penetration would not be easy. Expect huge battle."

"Yeah. So we'll take a detour through the hovering reefs to the right and swing around behind the Castle. That's where we'll find the ether mine and freight entrance I mentioned." The islands were connected by ropes. 

Taion: "Understood. We shouldn't be hanging around here for long. Let's make for those 'reefs', as you called them."

"Good. **This way. Follow me.**" The group make their way towards the rope. 

---

The final island connecting to the freight entrance were heavy with black fog, and ether particles evaporated from the ground here and there. Taion remarked, "There it is." Several levnises and soldiers gathered around the area. 

Lanz: "Black fog, too. Few enough numbers to sneak around."

Sena was worried, turning to Mio, "Is Colony 4 gonna be safe, do you think?"

"They should be OK. We haven't seen the light for a while. I think that's a good sign."

Taion urged, "Let's move. The fact that we killed Consuls must be old news at this point. Could have made examples of a few people by now."

Eunie rebutted, folding her arms, "They ain't expecting us to sneak aboard, though. We've got 'em with their pants down. Let's get in there, mess 'em up, get out, bish bash bosh."

Noah wasn't so optimistic, "Actually... They may have already... anticipated our moves."

Lanz couldn't believe his ears, "Nah, mate. Come off it."

"Think about it... How would they have known where we'd be?"

"Huh..."

"Can't be a coincidence. I mean, sure, it could have been intuition on Ethel's part, but we have to be realistic."

Eunie: "So it's a trap? You wanna turn back?"

"No... we'll go. We can't turn back now. We can't allow their deaths to have been in vain."

Taion: "So you would entertain the risk?"

"It does sound bad."

Pushing his glasses up, "You know, I think I kind of like it." OK, that doesn't sound like him. Noah iris widened. 

From behind a rock further behind them, the girl that took Guernica's eyepatch watched the group, unbeknownst to them. 

---

Moving closer to their target, a bunch of levnises guarding the area, looking in several directions. One person talking to a Levnis about the chests, or maybe speaking over his Iris. Rows of Levnises parked within the Castle; one transporting levnis is zooming slowly on the air. Just one more bridges{{footnote: This is not man-made bridge, but natural bridge.}} and they'll reach where they wanted to, the containers. And another slope to reach a platform connecting to the freight entrance via a man-made bridge. 

Sena commented, "Looks like you were right, Noah. There's a whole bunch of containers here." Lanz nodded in agreement. 

Manana: "A welcome gift for easy sneakings!"

Noah: "Let's go over this again. First, we get to those containers without being spotted. With me so far?" There were more containers to the right of the chest we spoke of earlier. 

Eunie: "Anyone spots us, we're like ninjas. We take 'em out quickly and silently." He nodded in return. 

Touching his Iris to pass data to the group, the Castle map popped up as he continued, "Once we're inside, we pick the right opportunity to proceed through the hangar. Our goal... is here." It's somewhere behind the Annihilator.

Mio: "The maintenance hatch, that leads outside."

Riku: "From there we head to outer deck."

Noah: "Right." Zooming in, that's a place we have seen before, a platform with no routes forward. Focusing on the area below, where the rings are located, "Enemy presence should be lower around there. Then we move to the main housing."

Lanz: "Assuming we get there, how do we trash it?"

Taion took over, "I can brief you on the next steps." Noah agreed with him. 

"After analyzing the data we got from Borealis, I discovered a flaw in the Annihilator's construction."

"A weak point?" He and Manana were holding their gadget, since they don't have Irises. 

"Indeed. Here. The weapon is designed to temporarily render the black fog inactive, condense, and collect it, then release it in one blast." A green line drawn from the top of the castle showing the Black Fog flow, into a container at the bottom, probably the condenser and storage unit, before passing it to the Annihilator located at the same height as the container. 

He continued, "Our best bet is to destroy the neutralizer assembly from which it draws its power, but it's located in the Castle interior. Getting there will be no joke." He was referring to the container. "Once there, we'll need to damage the auto-balancer in the barrel's housing." This was the 'grip' that connects the Annihilator to the ring. 

Highlighting the ring, "Most likely it was built in a hurry. The movable barrel is affixed to this outer ring that you see here. But the ring isn't strong enough to take the barrel's weight or absorb the recoil. That's why the auto-balancer was added after construction, as an afterthought."

Eunie can't sync with the high-tech info given to her, "So what, we've just gotta smash that thing to pieces?" 

Taion: "Smash it and the entire ring begins to fall apart, **and** the barrel collapses under its own weight. "

Mio had a question, "How strong is the auto-balancer? Not too sturdy?"

"Nothing Ouroboros can't handle."

Eunie highlighted another stuff above the ring. The auto-balancer was behind the ring. "So, what's this thing?"

Taion explained, "**That**, is a refrigeration unit -- the barrel needs vast amounts of energy. It would have to be kept cool at all times, to keep the energy in check."

"I'm surprised it's so **huge**."

"Seems that was built quickly too. It's got both bulk and heft to it. They probably couldn't have made it any smaller."

"Hmm. A rush job, huh."

Lanz first deactivated his iris before others followed, "OK then. We all good to go?"

Noah: "Yeah. No more taking it easy. Let's make this happen."

---

Noah, popping his head from behind a container, overheard a soldier back-facing them spoke to his/her iris, "Hurry up and load the stuff going to Colony 5 into the transport." Then, (s)he turned to another soldier from behind him/her, in Noah's direction, nudged, "And that stuff is going to the Castle." 

He already hid his body before the soldier turned, "Hear that? They're going to the Castle."

Taion: "Let's hide in that container." 

The group swiftly and quietly moved behind and between containers, checking that soldiers weren't looking in their direction. They then heard a Keves soldier signaled into his/her iris, "OK, start loading." Several 6-legged transporting levnis entered the Castle. 

---

> **Translator's note on environment:** Lots of levnis inside the castle patrolling the factory-looking interior.  Unfortunately, it was hard to describe the scenery, except for bridges and machinery; nothing natural, nothing worth describing. This, is **Keves Castle**, in Keves Castle Region. 

---

The group quietly sneaked past patrolling/stationed soldiers and levnises, via small path in between containers or other formations. Arriving at a joint, the group stopped, watching all directions, waiting for levnises to pass as Taion checked the map. Sena turned to him and asked, "So, where's the maintenance hatch?" 

"It's in the reserve area on the upper level. First, we'll need to take the elevator that can get us up to that floor." The group looked in the distance where there were slanted elevators like the ones in the shopping mall (not lift but elevators). 

Eunie scanned their routes: "I don't see any guards."

"Too foggy, for taste of Manana."

Lanz cut their discussion short, "If we're gonna move, now's the time."

Noah gave final caution, "That said, we are indoors. Move fast, but keep your eyes peeled."

Mio: "Yeah, of course." The others nodded and continued their journey. 

---

"Riku see! There is Annihilator!" The group exit the final door they needed to past, and now located behind the Annihilator. 

"Bigger than Homecoming pudding!"

Eunie: "That's huge. Think of the firepower... Two or three colonies could, like, be wiped off the map with one shot of that."

Mio turned to Noah, "We have to hurry! If it starts moving now..." To which he nodded back.

"If the map is correct, the auto-balancer should be in that housing." They look at a bunker-like door placed behind the Annihilator, below the refrigeration unit. It seems like it's a building that you can enter.

Sena: "That's what we're after, right?"

"Yeah!" Then, the group dashed towards their target. 

---

===

They stopped in front of the auto balancer, Noah commented, "It looks even bigger, seeing it up close..."

Taion looked up, signaled, "Noah. That's the auto-balancer."

"Right. Just like on the map."

Lanz: "Well then, let's get to it. Sena!"

"My pleasure!"

Taking one step forward, a glowing fingernail poked in front of them, before exploding. After the black smoke fades, the group looked up: a moebius (in the moebius monster form) with sharp teeth started speaking, "Sorry pals, 'fraid I can't let you do that."

Noah: "You?!"

"'Sup? Been a while, eh?" It's the moebius from Eunie's past lives! The last time he appeared, he destroyed the Golden Flame Clock. 

Lanz: "Moebius... How'd you figure it out?"

"You lot aren't too bright, are you? Sure, we can't pinpoint your exact position inside all the black fog, but we can get a general idea where you're hanging out. Once we picked up your reading near the Castle, we knew. I mean, what, you were just passing through, were you? You'd have to be an idiot to think that."

"**Grrr!**"

Eunie's eyes got watery, trembling as it evokes her memory. She gritted her teeth as she got reminded. 

Taion noticed and cut her shock short, "Eunie? What is it?"

She turned to look at him, "It's... Nothing." Then look back at the moebius, "This guy just does my head in, is all."

Manana: "He very condescending."

Lanz: "I couldn't agree more. Let's shut him up then."

"Heheheheheheheh....."

"Pffft!"

The moebius transformed back to the human form. It was comprised of two moebius, D and J. 

Lanz was shocked, "Joran... You're here too..."

Putting his hands behind his head, "Ahahahahah..."

D put his hands to his back, found the button, and remove his helmet. 

Noah: "So that's what you look like..." Yellow-brownish hair, some shaved moustache, tanned skin, crimson iris, and thick eyebrow. He had an earring on his right ear, not his left. Not very special. 

He replied, "Whadda ya think? Quite the looker, eh?"

Sena: "I knew it was a trap!"

Joran: "I'm not entirely sure I would say 'trap' exactly. Eh, you'd have to ask N for the details."

Noah: "N?"

D: "So you too down P and O, didja? Not bad at all!"

Joran: "Good riddance, I say. Idiots. I mean, going past the time limit while Interlinking? Who does that? _Dumbest thing I've ever heard!_" He laughed as he shook his head.

Taion now had the confirmation, "So that really was it. The time limit."

D: "Well, since you lot have already tangled with them, we can make this quick. I'm just glad I won't have to explain this." The moebius purple hue illuminates his body as he finished his sentence. 

Joran: "Yes. Why even explain?" Both transformed to their respective moebius before Interlinking. 

Taion: "How typical."

"So? Loads better than P and O, right? Hehehe!"

Riku: "Can beat them this time?"

Lanz: "Won't know until we try!"

Sena was shocked at his words, "Well, what are we gonna try?! **Joran's in there, you know**?"

"**Yeah, I noticed!**"

Eunie couldn't make her decision, "N-Noah?!"

He nodded, calmly, "No time to think!" Withdrawing their blades, he continued, "For Ethel's sake... **We have to destroy the Annihilator**!"

---

The ring had been drawing energy. Noticing the globules of condensed black fog, Manana screamed, "**Annihilator has started moving!**"

Riku seconded, "This is bad, Noah!"

"I see it!" He and Mio immediately Interlink while he speak. D and J blocked their path before they reached the auto balancer. From behind, Lanz and Sena interlinked and joined in the fight. 

"No you don't!" D and J threw them in the opposite direction from the auto balancer. 

"Haaa!!!" He kicked Lanz's Ouroboros in the face. From behind, Noah's Ouroboros landed a slash, but he blocked it, and Mio took control. 

"Whatcha slackin' around for? If you don't hurry... the Colony's gonna be a pile of ash!" His fingernails easily cut off her limbs. 

Eunie's Ouroboros was at a distance, not joining in the fight. Taion was calling for her presence, "Eunie! What are you doing?!" She was still focusing on the Moebius, lingering on her past life's memories. She tried her hardest to shake the burden away, bringing herself up in the air as she randomly shoot bullets around D and J, so random that none hit them. 

Mio was still on the floor, trying to get back up, as she noticed and warned, "Behind you, Eunie!"

"Huh!?" She turned and saw him an elbow distance away from her. He gripped her face in his arms. She struggled to release her head from his grip. As he threw her a distance away, he launched bullets at her, herself stuck to the wall for a moment before gravity took hold and fell to the ground. 

Taion: "What's the matter, Eunie?! You're too slow!" She struggled to stand up as D and J landed. Mio also got to her feet behind the background. 

D: "Girly! I think we've met before."

Eunie, her voice trembling, "Wh-what?"

"Heh heh heh... Those eyes! You're afraid, aren't you? Why so scared? Heh heh heh! I'll kill you whenever you cross my path!" 

"Uh huh!" She gasped of fear. 

Taion try to take over, seeing that she lost to her emotions, "Let me lead! I'll handle this! Go! Mondo!"

"You're not hittin' me!" He dodged the flying cards with ease. 

"Hah! Sure about that?"

"What?"

"Bind!" It created a ring around D and J. "Scatter!" They joined and exploded. 

Sena: "We won?"

Noah peered closely, "No..."

With a green hue, the Moebius dashed from behind the enshrouding smoke and caught hold of Taion's Ouroboros's neck, himself can't believe it, "What?!" He then threw him to a wall. "Gaaaaaaa!!!"

Lanz: "Joran..."

Joran: "Sorry, I don't think so. You'll have to do something about me first. You'll never win this otherwise. Heh heh heh!" D and J landed in front of the fallen-to-the-floor Taion's Ouroboros. 

Lanz: "Urg... Well then... We'll just have to take out **this**!" Sena took over and landing a hammer towards the auto balancer. 

Sena: "Mimi! You gotta keep them busy!"

"I'll do that!" She launched herself towards D and J. Yet, D and J easily blocked their path with his beams firing at a forward angle. Sena's Ouroboros had been sliced to pieces, its limbs all detached from the torso. Smoke rose from where the limb detached. 

D: "What, you thought this was just a fashion choice?" He was pointing to the crystal 牛角 on his head, "These can sense the slightest shifts in the air. Kind of a sensor, really. Even without looking at you, I can tell exactly what you're doing, so you brats better learn fast!" He picked up Taion's Ouroboros from the ground by his neck, the latter drooped, still haven't recovered from the last smash. He threw him towards where the other two Ouroboros were. 

Meanwhile, the energy ball on the Annihilator started gathering power. His index finger signaling them to 'come, come!', Eunie switched back to her Ouroboros, was still scared looking at him, trembling as she slowly stood up. Noah and Lanz took control, launching themselves at him, no time to waste. 

Taion: "**The Annihilator!!!**" Eunie still haven't got up on her feet yet, panting out of fear as she watched the other two fought D and J, only to get their limbs cut off. 

Taion desperately called out, "Eunie, what are you-?! Move! If you won't move, let me-"

Effetely, "Taion..."

"Huh!" He may have understood her. 

"**Urgaaaaaaaaaaa**!!!!" She screamed out loud, trying to get over her fear, then launched herself at him, crazily using her rifle as a melee weapon, which the moebius dodged with agility. 

Grabbing her rifle under his armpit while she tried to pull it out, "Getting desperate?"

Noah: "Eunie!"

"Heheheheh..." He pointed her fingernails at her eyes, slowly bringing it to her, just like the end of her past life's memories, continued, "Or maybe you've realized that the end is nigh."

"**Urgaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!**" She wouldn't give up, blasted her rifle from between his armpits, hitting the auto balancer. 

"Urg..." He just realized, turning back and saw it on fire. She recalled her rifle and blasted some random shots at him, before sending more rifle blast. It seemed like one hit managed to slice his core. 

"I thought I told you, I can read your every movement in the air!" He got hold of her neck. 

She gritted her teeth, "Hah!"

"Huh?"

Now calmed down, "All you're sensing... is the area around you."

"What's your point?"

"Well, if I make some distance, looks like you can sense... spark all!" She disappeared from his grip, Taion took over and teleported behind him. 

"An illusion?"

"Just so!" Many of the Mondos had already stuck under the auto balancer, had been imitating as a bullet, now turning back into Mondo with the flick of a finger, "**SCATTER!!!**" That destroyed the auto balancer with the burst of a flame. 

"Son of a-... You did that at the start?!" Losing the auto balancer, the Annihilator was slowly detaching from the ring, preparing to crash below it. He tried to grab him, Eunie dodged it, and he seemed to be chained to the ground,

"Heh... Thought you had my number? You were so into my fear that you didn't notice what changed! And sure, I was scared. But even then... You'll find I'm no quitter!"

As the explosion continued, "Aaaaaaaaaa!!!" He tried to apply force to release himself from the chain, to no avail. The two 'flaps' floating behind Eunie's Ouroboros had been piercing his limbs at its joints to the ground, 'lives' being released from the wounds. But he could escape: he detached his limbs like a lizard detaching its tails, and quickly wriggle backwards. 

"You ain't escapin'!" Eunie's Ouroboros pulled the two 'flaps' and redirected it to his torso, pinning down at its shoulders before landing a leg on his face.{{footnote: How come suddenly so weak?}}

Taion: "**Eunie**!"

She gritted her teeth for a moment before jumping backwards. The Annihilator had been tilting downwards, the energy ball dissipating smaller and smaller, until its weight can no longer hold and break the ring. Eunie escaped from being dropped down below. 

D: "**J! Split up now!**" Their situation was dire. 

"Got it." The Annihilator exploded, forming a fireball, and the 3 Ouroboros raised shields at a distance{{footnote: All 3 shields are the ones we see from Lanz's Ouroboros, unsure how.}}. The fireball slowly grows and engulfed a portion of the castle. 

As the blinding light dimmed, Lanz and Sena peered down from over the edge, Lanz asking, "Are they dead?" 

The others took step behind them, and Taion had an answer, "No... I shot one of my Mondo into their body. I sense it's still there." It was the one that hid itself at its core just now. "I'd say it's likely they got away."

"That right...?"

Taion now had time to turn to her, "Eunie... Have you ever met him before? As in before we became Ouroboros, I mean."

"No idea... But I think that... something inside me remembers." Her hand trembling as she clenched it in front of her chest, "That guy... and his claws{{footnote: This, is what Translator meant by 'fingernails'.}}..."

Noah: "Maybe that has to do with Moebius too. Why they exist here in our world."

In a shaking voice, "Well then... I've gotta know, don't I? And then, I'll break free... And it won't have to feel like I'm suffocating..."

Sena: "Eunie..."

Noah: "We can think more later. Right now, we should make ourselves scarce."

Mio seconded, "You're right. We might have destroyed the Annihilator, but we haven't liberated the Castle." They turned to look at the Castle behind them. 

---

Inside the castle, standing on a platform beside the rushing waters, there was a turbine that blocked living objects from passing through alive. Lanz remarked, "Great. We can't go on with this thing in the way!"

Riku suggested, "Maybe this channel... not connect to outside Castle?"

Noah, checking the map once more time, "Weird... This wasn't on the map."

Eunie: "So where are we at, right now?"

"Somewhere here in the mid-level?" Looking upwards, "It's OK. If we go a bit further, we can get back in the channel." There was some rings moving upwards around a pole, which they could ride to get up. 

Sena: "Might as well, then. Let's see where this goes."

"Yeah." 

---

As they arrived, trotting out of the shallow pond, they were trapped in the Queen's chamber. Before the got out, Mio foreboded something weird, turned to Noah and asked, "Um... are you sure we're on the right path? Doesn't this feel off?"

"We followed the right route..." Checking the data on his iris again, "According to Bolearis's data, we should be..."

Meanwhile, Riku and Manana were glancing at the surrounding, with the latter remarked in an upbeat tone, "Everything here look so sumptuous and lavish!"

Noah felt off, "Wait... Hm?" Looking at the surrounding, "It's the right path, but... **We shouldn't be here!**"

Mio: "What didja mean? Why shouldn't we?" He quickly dashed towards the center of the long path, and the group followed, revealing themselves bare. 

As if to confirm something, he turned to his right and sighed, "Huh... **I should have known!**" 

As the group joined in, Eunie commented, "Th-this place. I saw an image of it in training."

Lanz: "Oh. Oh... **Shit, we gotta go!**"

Taion was confused, "Noah, is this where I think it is?"

Effetely, "Yeah. The throne room!"

Riku and Manana were shocked, the former commented, "This not just bad place. This worstest place, heart of enemy base!"

Taion quietly and calmly spoke, as if to prevent catching attention, "We haven't been noticed, yet. Let's get out of here, now!"

"Good idea." If they come out of the left, they should be able to leave from the right, due to symmetry of the building. The group quickly dashed for the water hole on their left, Noah taking some more look at the throne before joining in penultimate. As the group leave, he stopped and took one more look. 

Mio nervously urged, "What are you doing?! We have to go!"

Yet, Noah ignored them and walked towards the throne, even when Eunie shouting from behind, "**Noah, what're you playin' at?! Come on!**" Mio couldn't leave him alone, ran after him. The others followed after looking at one another. 

Arriving on the throne, he looked around and saw the array of pods lined around the throne. Mio stopped beside him and asked for assurance, "Is this...?"

"Yeah. I barely remember it... but yeah... This is the place... where we were born..." They could see shadows of humanoids inside the orange fluid. 

Lanz: "Spark... This is creepy. Were we... ever like that?"

Eunie: "My skin's crawlin'... *Please can we leave*?"

Sena: "All those people... Do you think they're sleeping? Or maybe they're..."

Noah turned to one pod, "Wait, is that... It **is** her." Mio turned in time to see him dashing towards a particular pod, herself confused, 

"What?"

"**Ethel!**"

"Huh?" The others followed and saw Ethel in her child form. 

Taion was shocked, "That's crazy! How can it be Ethel?"

Sena: "Well, it sure looks like her... but this is definitely a first-termer!"

Eunie: "No. It really is Ethel. From when we first met her."

Lanz seconded, "Yeah. No mistake."

Mio prompted for more, "W-What do you mean, when you first met...?"

Noah, with shuddering tone, turned around and asked himself, "What in the... **spark... _is_ this?**"

Eunie: "This is what they taught us, right? That our lives are born from the Queen..."

Taion was shocked, "You are as well?"

"Huh? Same for you guys?" To which he nodded.

"We soldiers are born from the Queen, we fight... and then..."

"To the Queen you return." The Kevesi Queen's voice sounded from above. Her throne slowly floated down as the group watched, ran up and faced her directly. 

"Th-the Queen...?"

Noah: "**Melia**..."

Mio: "That's the... Queen of Keves... Melia..."

The Queen continued, "You have returned... My beloved... soldiers..." The group disturbingly gasped. Then, N teleported beside the Queen, a few steps behind. 

Noah: "A Consul?"

N did not hide his disgust, sniped at the group, "Ouroboros rabble. You dare to intrude on the presence of Her Majesty, Melia Antiqua?"

"Huh?"

Sena: "There's a Golden Consul...?"

Eunie: "What... is this guy?"

Taion: "He's not like the other Consuls we've met... Mio, be careful!" He turned to her, but her vision was locked on him. She tremblingly breathed out as Taion called for her attention, "Mio!"

She gasped and turned to him, "Ah... sorry."

"What's wrong?"

Shaking her head, "Uh, nothing. Don't worry. I'm OK..." But inside her head, "_I know him... But from where...?_"

Noah tightened his iris as he tried to look more. Suddenly, a throbbing knock emanates from his brain as he groaned in pain, voicing out, "What is... this sensation...?"

Thrusting her staff on the floor, the Queen continued her speech, "I have endeavored, for countless years... to protect... and shelter Keves under my aegis. And now you seek to bring ruin to this world." Shaking her head, "This grieves me."

Lanz couldn't believe his ears, "Come off it. How are we bringing ruin to anything?"

"You seek to deny it? Think. Upon your actions. Have you, or have you not... destroyed Colony Flame Clocks?"

Eunie rebutted, "We didn't have any choice!"

"No choice? Indeed. I assume then... you had no choice but to collude with our sworn enemy?"

Noah, recovered from his throbbing headache, "That's why you've been trying to wipe us out? **Both us, and Ethel's Colony 4?!**"

"Verily it is said... Ouroboros abhor this world. You must be erased, lest this world be destroyed."

Eunie: "We don't 'abhor' anything! **Do you realize how many battles we've fought and won for Keves? We've served you our whole lives. And now this bollocks?!**"

Noah: "**Your Majesty! Please!**"

"You say you fight for Keves? That you've served _us_? Are you certain? Rather it seems... you have been fighting for yourselves and none other." The group gasped at the new insight, including Mio and the others. She continued, "You cling to life in your desperation. That is why you have fought. Unchecked, Ouroboros will lead this world to ruin. Now, by my authority, you shall perish."

Noah gave up convincing her, too disappointed, just like Ethel being disappointed, "So... That's it? That's your verdict, then?"

N cut in, "It is not Her Majesty's 'verdict'. 'Tis the will of the world."

"It's what?"

Melia: "Indeed. The security of this world is paramount! Therefore, Ouroboros... The end is nigh... for you shall die by my hand!"

---

Noah and Mio dashing towards the Queen before slicing her, Lanz and Eunie were firing their ranged arts, Eunie exclaiming, "Wha-what the snuff is that? Stupid wall of light thing!"

Sena: "It's stopping our attacks in their tracks!"

The Queen raised her staff and summoned 3 fireballs, shooting at them as the fireballs instantaneously regenerated. Eunie dodged behind Lanz for the shield, while others ran to escape. One of it hit in front of Sena and she fell and dragged on the ground. 

"Sena!" Mio called out in panic. Another fireball was about to hit her as the Mondo swirled around her just in time. 

"Hmm..." Taion dodged the fireball, now that it was aimed at him, and the Mondo weren't protecting him for the moment. 

Turning her attention, the Queen casted multiple shots at Mio and brought her down, lying on the floor. 

"Mio!" Noah immediately dashed in front of Lanz and Eunie towards her, and Lanz and Eunie followed behind, him defending while her suppressing fire. The Queen does not care about her fire given her frequency shield. 

He caught hold of her, helped her up while she apologized, "Sorry... Lost my focus." Lanz blocked a fireball their way, so she had time to question, "How's Sena?"

He don't know, so they turned to look. Taion was standing in front of her, blocking a fireball with his Mondo. He sent his Mondo at the frequency shield to no avail; it burnt and fell to the floor before turning into ash. Sena overtook him, "**AAAAAAAAAAAAAA WUAAAAAAAAA!!!**" With her full force, the hammer crashed so hard the frequency shield became brightly visible with its honeycomb shape. She tried thrusting her hammer inwards, only to send shockwaves along the shield. 

The Queen look at her futile actions, slowly raised her staff, as Sena gasped in agony, bringing down her hammer in the meantime, before quickly backed up, dodging the fireballs. Looking backwards as she run, the Mondo swooshed behind her and blocked as she escape. Eunie fired futile shots as Sena regrouped with her and Taion. 

Noah: "All right, then..." He was ready to draw out Lucky Seven as Lanz exclaimed, blocking more attacks in the meantime, 

"Noah, you crazy?! That's the Queen!"

Mio was similarly shocked at his action. He continued, "I know... But we have to!"

Lanz: "Even so..."

Eunie: "**Noah!**" That caught their attention. The Queen was tired with gathering puny fireballs; channeling her energy into a huge fireball, so huge it shone like the sun in the sky. N was doing nothing, but his eyes fixated on Noah. 

"Huh!" Noah, seeing the change of situation, temporarily gave up drawing Lucky Seven to prepare for the big hit. The group were catching their breathe for the big one. 

Suddenly, the neck of the queen reverberate quickly, and electric sparkles released as her neck exploded, her head tilted to the side. Black smoke rose from her body as the group watched and gasped. 

Noah: "What? What's she...?"

Being 'broken', the fireball slowly dissipated, growing smaller and smaller; together, an explosion detached her mask. Her head drooped down, she does not have a face; it was a humanoid robot. 

Noah couldn't believed his eyes, "Her Majesty is a... machine?!"

Eunie: "Spark off!"

Lanz, with a high tone, "You serious?!"

"Hm hm hm hm hm... Hahahahaha....  **HAHAHAHAHAHA**!!!" N put his hand over his golden mask as he laughed hard, continued asking, "Was that your doing, Queen? You haven't given up your false hope. Very well. By all means, look on." He took steps towards the group, "Witness how hollow your hope rings... as I slice it all to ribbons!" As he passed by her, he pushed her slightly and she fell and crashed onto the ground. 

Noah suddenly felt the intense throbbing on his head again. "What... Again... Blast it..." As his vision blurred, "Why does he... make my... head hurt..." It was so painful his sword and himself dropped to the ground. 

That caught Lanz's attention, turning his head to him, asked, "Noah!  What's wrong? We're not done yet! **Take up your Blade!**"

He tried to pick up his sword slowly while Sena added, "What's going on?!"

Mio: "Are you OK?"

Just as he picked it up and stood, N spoke, "It is fate."

Noah: "Huh? Fate?"

"Many have tried, but none have ever managed to escape its flow." He summoned his blade. 

Mio, looking at his sword, "What, that sword... How does he...?" It looked like Noah's.

Before the battle begun, the Castle emergency siren rung. N turned to it, confused at the disturbance, and asked on his Iris, "What now?"

"Lord High Consul! Th-the Lost Numbers are attacking!"

"The Lost Numbers?!" Outside, there were many ships soaring above the air, with anti-air weapons firing from the castle at them. Where the bullet meet the shields, black smoke rose. The ships were exactly like the ones Guernica rode on. As they approached, the dropped the automatons onto the ground. 

One of the ship aimed directly at the windows on the other side of the throne room, smashed the windows into pieces, dragging itself on the floor while dimming its engine. Friction took over and it stopped right behind the group. Automatons dropped to the ground and make their way, clearing any obstacles with their machine guns. N withdraw his sword from its sheathe, blocked the attacks by slicing so fast that it created a shield in a semicircle in front of him. 

Eunie remarked as the group watched some of the automatons flew off the ground, "Wait, those Levnises..."

Sena: "Yeah, we've seen one before. Gotta be!" Those flying levnises got hold of the pods as other suppressed fire. The caught as many as they could with both their 'hands' while returning to the ship. 

Lanz sensed that now's the time to escape amidst the chaos, "Noah! Let's book it." He withdrew his blade and started running past them. 

Taion and the others joined in, himself speaking, "Yes. They won't be attacking the Colony now. There's no point in our being here any more!" Only Noah and Mio still had their weapons on, his weapons shuddering furiously. 

"You're right... Still..."

Amidst the flame, N had no fear, but he no longer could stop them from escaping, only looking at them. Looking around, more automatons took steps slowly towards him, even if it means death. 

"**NOAH!!!**" Lanz shouted. The best time to escape is almost nigh. 

"Nghh... All right!" They dashed back out as the automatons, each with two hive of pods swooshed above them. An automaton was firing its machine gun through the broken window, earning time for the automatons to escape. With an explosion and all automatons escaped, it turned back and zoomed into the distance with the other automatons. One of the pods that escaped was Ethel. The Castle did not go after them, watching the Lost Numbers retreating into the distance. 

N pressed a button and took off his mask. Looking at his palm, "The passage of fate... How easily it slips from my grasp..." Clenching his fist, "Yet perhaps, it will come within reach once more." ***His face, is an older version of Noah.*** 

"And if it does? What will you do then?" A female with silver leg plates entered from behind, with cat ears, wearing a silver mask. **_Her voice, is exactly Mio's._** As she approached N, she removed her mask; her face an older version of Mio's, of course.

"Need you ask? I will give us equilibrium. A time unchanging... Our eternity." She did not comment on his reply.

**Update on the Diamonds:** Two rows of diamond, plus 2 diamonds on the third row, cancelled out. Looks like it's 10 days since last chapter. 

> **Mio's diary:** Time bears down on us without mercy. ***How should we live the days that we have left? What should we spend them on?***{{footnote: How about for you?}} We saw one possible answer to those questions. But we cannot accept it. Not even as a last resort. After all, it was the only path that was offered to those two. We should all be free to choose our own way. That's our belief. That's why we fight...
