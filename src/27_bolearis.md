# Bolearis's Tale, Ethel and Cammuravi

===

(After they finished collecting the mushrooms in sacks, and giant turnip besides it.)

Noah stood up after he examined the stacks of food, "All right then. That should be us good for food now." The group gathered around their foods. 

Sena agreed, "Yeah! Looks like that'll last us a little while."

As they were speaking, Mio heard something unusual from behind. She turned to examine the vicinity, the source of the sound. Taion, noticing her unusual act, prompted, "What's wrong, Mio?"

It seems like someone was approaching from behind the trees. As a group being pursued, they naturally withdrew their blades in the direction, Lanz calling out, "Who's there? Come out!"

Borealis limped his way out of the bushes. Noah gasped as he sheathed his blade, "Bolearis?"

Bolearis hadn't stopped since his escape, panting hard as he stood in front of the group, furiously catching his breath. 

---

(Some time later.)

They sat a bonfire while putting Bolearis on a chair. Behind Bolearis was some pond of water. There were some remnants of building shards near them as well. As the group gathered around, Eunie casted a healing ring targeted at him. A few moments later, "Yeah, much better... I owe you."

Since he could now speak, Noah had questions for him, "What are you doing over this way? I thought you were going to the Castle?"

"Yeah... No, I went. Annndddd this is what I got for my trouble."

"So, tell us, what happened...?" 

He closed his eyes and recall. 

---

(Some time earlier...)

Ethel vehemently questioned, "But why, Your Majesty? Why would you attack Colony 4?!" 

N answered for her, "You came into contact with Ouroboros, did you not?"

Ethel gasped at his intel gathering ability. 

N continued, "I'd call it... burning out the contagion."

"C...contagion...?"

Borealis sniped back, "You're implying we've been contaminated?!"

"Have you not? You have been removed from the protection of the Flame Clocks. You no longer need to wager your lives in battle."

The Queen added, "Who struggles not in life, deserves not to live. That is the compact of our nation, and moreover, the truth."

Ethel gave her a disappointing look, "Majesty... My Queen..." Her hopes had never been so low before. 

N continued, "Yet, to punish you all for fate's machinations would be a misstep. Therefore... I shall grant you a chance."

"What must I do?"

"Eliminate Ouroboros."

Ethel gasped; the last grass she clung to had been lost. "You want me to-... Noah, and the rest...?!" 

O and P were walking into the scene quietly, Ethel and Bolearis not noticing, particularly as N continued speaking and drawing their attention, "Naturally, I am cognizant of the fact that the enemy is wily and capable. I have no intention... of sending you alone." Someone was walking behind O and P. We could only see some silver leg plates. 

Then, Ethel finally noticed some shadows behind her. Turning to her back, she saw O and P sandwiching Cammuravi. "Huh! _Cammuravi?!_ Wh-Why are _you_ here...?"

"Ethel..."

Bolearis: "H-how? But you're not even on the same side!"

N smiled, "Entertainment."

Ethel and Bolearis turned to N, her asking, "Pardon?" Cammuravi also like to hear his explanation. 

He continued, "Those who have been released from the Flame Clocks sacred indenture... cannot be affected by the Moebius Iris. To bring you back under control, I would have to force your rebirth... But that wouldn't be nearly as fun..."

Queen: "The power you two wield surpasses even some of our Consuls. I have great hopes for you... Ethel. Cammuravi... "

---

Back to the present, Bolearis continued speaking from a third person's perspective; but we still see some scenes he reminisced: "They gave Ethel, and Cammuravi, new Ferronises. They've been made, specifically to kill Ouroboros."

Ethel looked at her giant Ferronis with two huge rings behind each shoulder, some blue lights illuminating from the inner circumference of the ring, and other parts of the Ferronises. It had a head the shape of a rabbit, plus two conical-shape drill-like feature stuck out from both of its side (where human ears would have been located). In the middle, there was a Flame Clock, burning purple flames (Moebius probably, neither Agnian yellow-green nor Kevesi blue), that stretches more than half the gauge. 

Bolearis continued, "The tune-up... might take a little while. Though... You don't have much time. The two of them are after your heads."

Noah asked for affirmation, "You're sure of this? Really?"

"That's why I came here. To give you warning. They already know your rough position. That's how I found you in the first place."

---

Back to the past, Bolearis had his Iris glowed, some information transmitted to his Iris, which he asked, "What's this?"

Ethel was standing in front of him, replying, "Plans of the Castle." It was a dark room, with few red lights in the background, nothing else could be seen. She continued, "They were tuning up my Ferronis when I 'happened' upon them. They include schematics for the Annihilator. Take them, and go back to Colony 4." 

"Commander, you mean...?" To which she nodded (for whatever reason translator cannot grasp.)

"If they can find us wherever we are, I want to at least secure a way for us to put up a fight. Am I wrong?"

"Huh huh huh... But Ma'am, we can't very well-!"

She cut him, her thoughts not to be changed, "Also, about Noah's group... If you happen across them, tell them this: I _will_ use lethal force... Yes?"

Bolearis tried to read what she's transmitting with her eye contacts. This is the time to test their tacit agreement. 

She continued inscrutably, "Furthermore, tell them I wish them all the best of luck, I hope they reach their goal."

"Commander..."

Some time later, he was running through the Castle, through some factories that was roamed by levnises and soldiers{{footnote: This is the Mechon Factory in Xenoblade 1, if you'd played that before.}}, sneaking past as they weren't looking in his direction while patrolling. Just before he made it to the front entrance, he saw some soldiers chatting and not noticing him as he ran off. 

---

Back to the present. Sena exclaimed, "Oh, Ethel... She sounds serious..."

Mio, in her appreciation stance, was touched by her words,  "And still, telling us to just... keep going...?"

Bolearis: "That's Ethel for you. Hard-headed as they come."

Noah asked, "Won't she get into trouble? Because of you slipping out?"

"Hardly... I'm just one missing footsoldier. No one's gonna pay it any mind."

Eunie wasn't convinced, "Huh? But your wounds earlier...?"

"Ha - truth is... They're from falling off a cliff on the way here. It was dark as snuff. Hahahahahaha..." Bolearis just laughed it off. 

"*Are you tuggin' my wings?*"

"Well, anyhow. It's nothing for you lot to fret over. This is our problem now. You focus on achieving your objective."

Noah: "We appreciate it."

"Eh but maaann... Why's the commander gotta duke it out with you lot, eh? And why was our foe Cammuravi there, the **Aspar**? Feels like the whole world's turned on its head." As he stood up, he announced to the group, "All righty. I'm headin' back! Got it? You lot scoot on along out of these parts. There's still some time before they're done tweaking. And with you on foot..."

Noah cut him short, shook his head, "We're not running away. Not after all this."

"Huh?"

Mio seconded her de-facto partner, "I'm staying too."

Sena turned to look at her, surprised, "What, really?"

"That light we saw, a while back... If that... If that had come from the Annihilator... _Even_ if we were to somehow reach our destination, if it was at the cost of all *your* lives, it wouldn't be worth it!"

"Hmmmmph..."

Mio continued, "Surviving like that... I couldn't bear it..." She dropped her head as tears started to aggregate. 

"Mimi..."

"Mio..."

Noah turned his glance from Mio and spoke strictly to "Bolearis. The Castle plans, can you share them?"

"Noah... You're not...? You wouldn't..."

"The fact remains - it was us that destroyed your Clock, therefore... "

"Yes, but that's-"

"Either way, I think it's clear at least part of the blame... lies with us. It's only fair, then, that we destroy this 'Annihilator'. Agreed?" Feeling beholden, he turned to look to Mio, whom returned glance and nodded. 

Eunie was still thinking they were kidding, "You for real?"

Lanz, now stood up from sitting on his chair, "I'd be up for a little detour."

Sena: "Same here."

Bolearis looked to them for a few seconds in silence, as Taion the coolheaded added, "You did offer us shelter. That creates an obligation."

Riku added, "No way around! Someone here need to keep friends in line. Count Riku in."

"If plan on fighting, will need first-rate chef too!" 

Eunie looked at them all agreeing, and she's the last, "Uhh..." She turned her glance from Manana to Mio, whom was looking on the floor. She remembered what they had spoke before: 

> "_And that's it? No looking back?_"
> 
> "_While my de-facto partner's running full steam ahead? I mean, I can't very well go backwards, can I now?_"

She lowered her head slowly as she thought about it for a moment, before speaking out in a wham-bam-whatever-ma'am{{footnote: One took this and tweak it from 'The Undoing Project' book.}} manner, "...Oh fine, go on then. You wouldn't make it far inside the Castle without a proper Healer, anyway."

In her appreciation stance, Mio was glad of her support, "Eunie..." Taion looked to her, not sure what he was thinking, perhaps surprised she'd make the improbable choice? 

Bolearis give in, "Thanks, guys... You're the best."

Seemingly where they camped when their food was stolen, because one saw the giant tunnel made of tree trunks. Actually, that's where they carried Bolearis to, because we could see the pond behind, which was where he had sat earlier. Bolearis was standing at a distance as the group was giving their final goodbyes. 

"I'll head back to Colony 4, in case the shit hits the fan. Good luck then, to all of you."

Noah replied, "Yeah. We'll be all right." Bolearis nodded to him and walked off into the distance, with the group watching him off. 

Taion warned thereafter, "Remember, we're up against a Castle. Get too close and we may come under fire. What's our plan?"

"I think we'll be able to manage, as long as we're careful."

>  **Noah's memories:** Seemingly inside the castle, night time. There seems to be buildings of unknown usage lined alongside a broad path. Soldiers stood and talked to each other. A levnis was seen parked in the distance. Noah stopped looking forward as other soldiers passed beside him. To his 8 o'clock, there was another building that released purple fumes from an unknown feature, but certainly not look like chimney; maybe windows? Looking up, he was facing the castle, and we could see the pitchfork and dual flame clock at the tallest part. 

Lanz, with his arms crossed, "Come to think of it, you used to go to the Castle for off-seer training once a year, right, Noah?"

Noah nodded. Taion turned to him and asked, "The black fog... Is there much there?"

"There's actually quite a bit. Around this time, the whole area is shrouded in it. They couldn't find us in that cave in Nih'l Valley, right?"

Mio questioned, "And you think... we can repeat that?" 

"Maybe."

Taion balanced the probabilities, "Using the fog to approach is clever, but risky... What if an annihilation event occurs?"

"You know, I hadn't really given it much thought up until you mentioned it, but... oddly, it hasn't been happening."

"Seriously?"

He nodded, questioned in a lower tone, "I'm not sure why." Then, he touched his temple twice and examined the map of the castle, continued, "Behind the Castle, there's an ether deposit being mined, in an area facing a lake." That was on an island connected to the castle via a bridge. "The ether being obtained there is then delivered into the Castle through a freight entrance."

The others received the map data on their Iris, with Eunie questioned after she deactivated hers, "So that's where we'll get our sneak on?"

He affirmed, "There won't be anyone in the containers. If we can just get to them, without being spotted..."

Mio looked at him in the eyes, continued his words, "Then we can get into the Castle." He turned to her as she spoke and nodded thereafter. 

Sena, in a pose like Taion's thinking mode, tracked the logic, "OK, let's assume we do give the guards the slip. What do we do once we're inside the place?"

Noah called out in a louder voice, "Taion. The sensors. What was the Colony 4 soldiers' search radius, with the fog out?"

"Their scanning range... I'd put in the ballpark of 15 metri."

Noah touched his iris, looked at the map to check the calculations. He moved his first person view directly after entering the freight entrance and signaled, "Look here. In the reserve area, there's a maintenance hatch that leads directly to the outer wall." As he pitched up, there was a ladder-like scaffolding that slanted its way to a window. "If we make it through here and get to the main housing... It'll land us in front of the Annihilator." Through the door was a platform that directly faced another platform, in between was some empty space, but below it there was some giant ring structure that seemingly could be walked on{{footnote: From retrospect, if one remembered correctly, you'd need to throw yourself into a pool of water that splashes up, so you get splash up with the water and it'll throw you onto the platform next door. Don't do this in real life, though; you'd break your spine or some bones at the very least.}}. 

Lanz seemingly agreed, "Less chance of being spotted by troops outside, too."

Sena upvoted, "We can do this."

Taion thought through it and "There's one concern. The Castle is the Queen's residence. What if we're found by the Consuls?" It's funny, they look at each other while looking at their maps, hands still on their temple. 

Noah replied, "Then I guess... we'll have a fight on our hands." Raising his voice, "But it's not like we don't have a retreat. Here." He plotted a window just behind where the Annihilator was positioned on the ring. That window zig-zagged across and brought them to the opposite end of the Annihilator.{{footnote: Okay, somewhat opposite end, though not perfectly lined.}}  "In Keves, after a Homecoming... They wash away the belongings of the dead, as part of a ritual. It's an understated affair. And the channel they use for it... is here. It flows straight out, connecting to the lake outside the Castle." The lake was a small island, so small it seems insignificant compared to the size of the Castle.

"I see... So, we open a hatch near the Annihilator, ride the current, and we should come out right at the lake." Noah nodded back as they deactivated their Iris. 

Eunie was complaining on the meantime, picking the tip of her wings as she spoke in a high tone, "More snuffin' water. _Every time we run... why do we always end up getting drenched?_ I mean... Feathers are a bitch to dry." 

Sena just smiled back at her, while Lanz crossed his arms and rebutted, "Every time being, our grand total of once."

Noah joined in, "Well, let's just hope we don't have to fight. That's the ideal case."

Mio: "That's it, then."

"Mmm. Ready whatever supplies you need. Then we can go."

Birds chirping as they group traveled down a huge tree trunk/root that swivel towards the bottom layer of Maktha Wildwoods. The modern dilapidated buildings had their ground floor{{footnote: The translator read about UK calling ground floor ground floor, but US called it first floor; but that was from a book in the 1970s, not sure if they'd changed it or standardized it. Anyways, one used the UK format, so one don't know; though this book is written with English US ahem ahem.}} on the bottom layer. Below, we could see purple liquids, presumably poisonous, filled large area of the lands, creating purple lakes. The lack of ventilation contained the mist in the area. Looking down, Eunie said to Lanz and Riku, feeling scared, "Er, are we really going this way?"

Lanz replied, "I can't see any other way to the Castle, can you?"

The others were waiting for Taion to check the map, perhaps for an alternative route. As he deactivated his Iris, he turned to Noah and shook his head, whom commented, "I don't want to drag our feet getting there. Be careful crossing through, yeah?"

Eunie dropped her head, effetely replied, "Are you joking me..."

Sena questioned, "Afraid of heights, huh?"

She snapped back, "Not afraid as such, but if we fell from here, we'd, like, die? Instantly?!"

Punching her fists on to the air, "If Manana think something tasty waiting on other side, then Manana can be brave." Sena nodded her head in her encouraging stance. Eunie just dropped her head one more time. 

Taion commented, "If we can make it across, we'll almost be out of Maktha Wildwood."

Mio: "Just one more hop to Keves Castle."

Noah turned to look back at the modern dilapidated building, the group followed his glance to check out what he saw, as he remarked, "We'll probably have quite a good view of it from over there."

Well except for Eunie, whom compromised, "Fine, fine, I get it! Let's just get this over with!" Then, she led the way as the group followed, hoping to quickly get the snuff out of there.

Ethel's Ferronis had been described, on the right side of the screen. Cammuravi's Ferronis was just beside hers, on the left side of the screen (right of Ethel's Ferronis). His had a crescent horn, seemingly wearing some coat, and the flame clock also of purple origin, except they burn clockwise; while Ethel's burn anticlockwise. There were some platforms that surrounded both Ferronis.  Cammuravi and Ethel were standing below their Ferronises, actually, in between. 

Not looking at each other, though standing at a distance side by side, Ethel started the conversation, "Of all the ways we could meet again, it ends up being this. The irony of it all."

"We are bound. That is how I see it."

"Bound? That certainly sounds like you. You're talking about..."

Closing his eyes, he replied, "Fate. I think, that is how you would put it."

Looking down to think for a moment, before looking up seemingly into the sky but perhaps at her Ferronis, "Fate, you say..." Then, turning to look at Cammuravi, she questioned, "Why? Why did you agree? To be reborn?"

He turned to her, "So you know?"

"There were rumors. That you were imprisoned. That you took the blame for the Colony's seizure." 

"It was only fitting."

Reminiscing their battle, Ethel continued, "Perhaps I should have killed you there and then."

But he hadn't got much time left. The central dot was the only red, but his was even fainter than Mio's.{{footnote: Translator don't know if Homecoming is once per year, or once per month, or what frequency it's held at. But later, we know it's held during an eclipse, but is eclipse even happening once in every n years or something?}} "Only through death... can our feud be resolved." Looking up at his Ferronis, "In a way, I am grateful. Now that I have been blessed with a Ferronis, and another chance."

"Another chance..." she looked back at her Ferronis. She recalled her speech with P, 

> "A Ferronis? This is for me?"
> 
> "Absolutely. It's been tailor-made to suit your every need. The same goes for his Ferronis. So, you'd better make the most of it, with what life you have left... hm?" The room was dark, but two beams of light shone, one on Ethel's, another on Cammuravi's. 
> 
> "Huh..." She could only gasped and return her glance on her Ferronis, and gasped again. 
> 
> "You've noticed! Good girl. I guess they don't call you Silvercoat Ethel for nothing. What a clever thing you are." Turning to the Flame Clock, she explained, "Those ones are a bit special. They're tied to both yours and Cammuravi's lives."
> 
> "Huh!" 
> 
> "The more the two of you get heated up, the more your power grows! Ahh! Doesn't that *sound sublime*? Even though you're released from the struggle of life, your precious life force... will connect straight to **Origin**."
> 
> She tried to read whatever signals from what she said, didn't questioned what is Origin, and just looked back at her Ferronis. The purple flame clock roars three-quarter of the gauge, burning hot. 

Back to the present, we could see behind them were soldiers and levnises patrolling the area, seemingly not noticing Cammuravi being an Agnian? Cammuravi directed a question to Ethel, "Ouroboros... They showed me their image, but just who are they? They seemed like soldiers from Keves and Agnus, but are they human?"

Closing her eyes, she replied succinctly, "They're hope."

"Hope?"

"Dreams... Desires... The future. Yes... They are hope personified."

"Indeed? They are your hope?"

"They are everyone's hope... Yes."

Their tacit agreement don't even require them to speak their intention clearly to make their final decisions, "I see... Then there's only one choice."

"Yes. Only one."
