# The Annihilator,

===

Some time later, the group walked and stopped at the edge of a cliff. 

Sena: "Is that...?" Far in the distance, a castle blurry in view. Below them were empty air, with some floating rocks, and seemingly reflection, a sea of emptiness. To their 10 o'clock, there were another ledge as high as where they now stood, with trees filling the place, clearly a forest. 

Eunie answered, "That's Keves Castle, all right. First time seeing it?"

She nodded, "Yeah..."

Manana: "Same level of elaborate as Castle of Agnus!"

Riku turned to face the forestry area. Nearer to them, towards the left, were some high-tech building remains. Far beyond the forest, "Can also see Great Sword on left."

Taion asked Noah, "Are we going through with this?"

He shook his head, "No, I see it's far too risky now. The area will be under strict guard. But downslope, we could go via the forest."

"Maktha Wildwood, huh..." 

Mio: "Doesn't sound too bad to me." Taion took the lead, and the others followed behind. Noah stood back and glanced at the Keves Castle for a moment before catching up with the group.

(Inside the Keves Castle.)

Two soldiers were leading Ethel through a walkway, with Borealis followed behind her, exclaiming as he examined the castle walls, "Oh-ho! Weh-hell, never been this far in before." The walls seemed metallic; the pentagonal tunnel that they're currently traversing had tall ceilings, and a barred window could be seen at the very top. At every fixed distance, there were beams shaped like insect legs, with a few segments, twitched in an angle. 

"Me neither... The last time I had an audience with the Queen, she had come in person to the warfront."As they reached the end of the tunnel, fan-shaped staircase lead them up to a higher platform. At the edge of the staircase, we have two light means emanating cyan 3D hologram that shaped like rings around a stick. 

At the end of the platform, they entered an elevator that send them to to higher platforms. 

Entering the Queen's chamber, the holograms displaying the same object as described before lined both side of the path. Behind the elevator, there were metal bars the shape of squid, forming windows to view the larger area below. Light bulbs decorated with embroideries provide cyan hue to the scene. The soldier lead them to several distance before the queen, before they part in both ways towards where the pods were still seen, while Ethel and Borealis continued nearer towards the queen. She stood in front of her seat. Both did the Kevesi welcoming stance, "Commander Ethel, Fornis Forward Army's Colony 4, reporting in as ordered, Your Majesty."

"It has been some time, hasn't it?"

"Ma'am... I am elated to find you in good stead, Your Majesty. That you would grace us with your presence, is an honor, above my station. "

"We can dispense with the stiff preambles, Ethel." Looking to her right, "N..." 

N, beside her, nodded his head, "Ma'am..." Then, he held his hands out and some form of hologram controls appeared. 

"N...?" Ethel was curious about him. "Consul N...? That's him?"

"N..." Similar for Borealis. "The head honcho of Kevesi Consuls himself. The Golden Consul..." Sawing their vision, N looked at them sideways. Borealis quickly took away his glance and returned to the floor. 

Outside the Kevesi Castle, on the outer ring, a giant cannon-like object started moving along the ring, changing its direction. Behind Ethel and Borealis, a hologram on-screen displays the event live. Ethel turned to look at it, asked, "What is that...?"

N explained it, "The Annihilator... The latest weapon in our military arsenal. It utilizes breakthroughs in application of the annihilation effect."

"You've harnessed it?!"

As black fog that rotated around the 'pitch fork' at the top of the castle, absorbing towards the Flame Clock between the pitch fork displaying half-Kevesi half-Agnian gauge, they were transferred along the ring towards the Annihilator. The Annihilator expands its throng and elongated it, like a half-opened flower petals, revealing the sharp pointed tip in the middle. 

N continued, "Not only is its power without equal, it has another exquisite benefit. Let me show you." 

Ethel was shocked, turned and asked him, "What, you mean... right here and now?"

Contracting his eyelids behind his mask, "Indeed. This will be its finest hour." Then, the central filament of the cannon started rotating furiously as purple electrical-like beams zapped between the four 'petals'. The Annihilation ball started gathering in front of its tip. 

The screen changed to show his destination, "The Urayan Mountains... A terrible shame. Her Majesty has a soft spot for them. Please do not think ill of me."

As the beam finished gathering, it fired with such bright light that it released rings of shockwaves to its side. The beam is so bright that it even penetrated to the Queen chamber, with Ethel gasping as she closed her eyes, reacting to the brightness. In the middle of the Urayan Mountains, an Annihilation event happened, carving out another circle on the top of it, sending rock remnants tumbling down the remains. The dust blew so far it even flew and reached the Keves Castle.

The group were walking on flat soil ground when the top of the mountain to their right suddenly shook, loud sound reverberated and shook the ground, Sena shouted in terror as the group got into defensive posture, Mio taken by surprise, "Wha-What?! What was that?"

Eunie suggested, "Just thunder...innit?" She and Lanz got out of their defensive posture. 

Lanz: "Brighter than any lightning I've ever seen. "

Riku: "Still ringing in ears..."

Taion questioned, "Where did the light come from?" He and Noah were looking to the top, Noah answering, 

"No idea. But... this can't be good..."

---

Back inside the castle. The screen displayed the carved out mountains. Ethel exclaimed, "What incredible power..." Borealis still flabbergasted. 

N: "Its effective range... has no discernible limit whatsoever."

Ethel felt something bad, "Wha-What are you?" They turned to face him. 

"I'm saying an attack like the one you just witnessed can be delivered... anywhere."

"So you mean to use this weapon against Agnus? Ah... If you're to use this, then... what about the Clocks...?"

The Queen answered in his stead, "Who said anything about using it on Agnus?"

Her iris constricted, "Ma'am...?"

"The next target... will be this." The screen changed to display Colony 4, as Ethel and Borealis watched, mouth wide opened.

As the groups passed some gushing water, Lanz called out to the group, "Watch the moss, guys, Mind you don't slip-woooooaaaaayyyyyyeeeaaahhhh...." Sena watched him slipped down the slope like children going down the slide. 

Eunie just gloated at him, "Ahahahahaha! He says, falling flat on his arse himself."

Lanz, slowly climbing on his feet, "Oh yeah, bloody hilarious. You're always taking the mick out of me. Noah!" He and Eunie turned to Noah, whom was lost in his thoughts. 

"Huh? Did you say something?"

"Oh for... Don't come crying if you fall." Then, he walked off, disappointed. 

The group continued their path while Mio stopped beside him, remarked, "You seem like you're a million miles away...{{footnote: Ok, so they calculated distance _also_ by miles?}} Lot on your mind?"

"Yeah, kinda..." He continued to look back down and lost in his thought. Mio felt the heavy burden from him as she watched him. The group slowly tread down the slope. As Mio took step, Noah followed. 

"Aaahhh..." Mio seemed to lose power while she walked, falling forward. 

That brought Noah's attention back to the present. "Uh...? Mio!" He quickly got in front of her and held her by her shoulders, preventing her from falling. She caught him on his arms as she stood up, 

"Ah... Thank you."

Concerned, he asked, "Are you OK?"

Smilingly, she replied, "Yeah, I just lost my foo-footing for a second. I'm-I'm OK." Then, she looked away and said in a softer tone, "For now, I'm OK..." 

"For now...?" He turned to look at her term symbol; it wasn't much left. "Ar-Are you... not feeling a hundred percent?"

"**Uh?** Nah, nothing like that!" She raised her tone in denial, smiling back at him, "I'm totally fine, promise. Like I said, I just *missed* my footing." 

He didn't believed so, their eyes caught each other as he tried to catch minor body language, then stodgily urged, "If you start feeling worse, just say. I _don't want you hiding it._"

She nodded back, "You're a kind man, aren't you?"

He blushed at the compliment, "I-I'm just... being polite." As he turned to face away from her, took a step forward, Lanz's wishes came true. He slide down like he did, "Whooooooaaaaaa!!!" In a shocking face, Mio watched him slid towards the group and crashed into Lanz, the others got out of their way before his impact. She just smiled back thereafter.
