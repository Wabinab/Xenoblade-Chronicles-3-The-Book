# Adventures Crossing the Desert

Next morning, after they woke up. Lanz, Eunie and Sena were stretching. Riku was helping Manana with folding up her sleeping bag while she watched. Mio was observing Taion by the table. Then, she turned her attention to Noah, whom was checking his iris. On his copper-tinted screen, he was scrolling through some soldier's information. One of them looked like the guy following behind Ethel, another one never saw before. 

She walked up to him, prompted, "Looking at something?" 

His eyes still focused on his screen, "Oh, nothing in particular, really. It's just kind of a habit. Checking our status, the war... Watching for info updates..." Laughing at himself, "Silly... I don't know why I still bother to check it any more. Not like there'd be updates..." Then, with his iris activated, he turned and meet her eyes. 

"Ah" With Mio filling his screen, her outline was glowing orange, to which he never seen before. As he glanced upwards to the top of her head, an orange{{footnote: The color isn't exactly orange, but something like copper orange; but just to make things easy, we'll just say orange without mentioning its shade.}} symbol that resembles Mio's blade came into existence. "What is it?" 

"An icon just popped up -- over your head." 

"Huh?" She activated her iris to check if she sees the same. Glancing over his head, "Oh yeah. Now I can see an icon for you as well." She saw an orange icon that resembled Noah's blade. 

"When did we unlock a feature like this? I've never noticed it before." Evoked by their conversation, others formed a circle with them. Noah turned his head to face Taion and Sena. On Taion's head, a symbol with an "8" outline; on Sena's a hammer. Both were blood red. Switching attention to Lanz and Eunie, Lanz had his broadsword, Eunie her rifle-staff. Both were also blood red. 

Glancing back at Mio's, "Yours seems to be... the only one not locked."

He tried clicking on it. Mio wasn't checking on her iris by now. She was galvanized, seeing before her eyes his outer jacket turned into one mirroring hers. 

"Huh!" Having shocked, she drew a step backward. Noah scanned his new clothing, "Wha-?" (in a high tone)

Manana and the others weren't less surprised, "Ohoho-"

Eunie: "He's lit up like a sparkin' lightbulb!" 

Noah reactivated his iris to check for more information. "I guess there must still... be more to this feature." He tried summoning his blades. Two rings appeared on both his hands, Mio's blade.  

Sena exclaimed, "Hey, that's Mimi's!" 

Lanz: "What in the blazes...?" 

As he closed his eyes, his "soul" was practicing moves with the new blade in the yellow-cloud space, like those he was in when he transformed to Ouroboros the other day. "I've never used this kind of Blade before, but all the techniques I can use with it are flashing before my eyes." 

Mio was eager to try, her smooth silver jacket replaced with one flurry dark red. Then, she withdrew Noah's blade. Closing her eyes, she saw what Noah meant. "It's so weird... Not like... we suddenly just gained the knowledge out of the blue. But... as if it were always ingrained deep within us. Strange..." 

Sena eyed on Mio while she activated her iris, yet was blood red.  "Aww, doesn't look like I can get Mimi's gear. Now that's a shame..." As she looked, Noah and Mio sheathed their blades. 

===

By now, the group were stoked. "Mm... This is?" As she gasped, Eunie's clothing transformed to Taion's, including the orange scarf. Yet, she wasn't satisfied, "How come I got moodyguts's and not Noah's huh?" As she turned and looked at "moodyguts," his jacket changed to hers. 

After scanning his new attire, he looked back at her equally curious: "That's what I'd like to know. Your class is the only one I can seem to pick, unfortunately." 

Then, Lanz long coat turned into a thin silver ones, with its inside egg-yolk yellow. Sena, before she transformed, also wore one of those; after, Lanz's long coat. They tried summoning their blades, him wielding Sena's hammer, and she carried his broadsword. 

Feeling its weight, he exclaimed, "Whoa... You can lug this thing about without a power frame? Not bad!" 

As he looked at her, she was scratching her head showered with his praise. She smiled back at him, after which they withdrew their new blades. 

Eunie, "Dunno how this is even working, but cool!" 

Taion, "But is this all part of Ouroboros, too? If it gives us more options in battle, I'm all for it." 

Sena agreed, "Yeah, I wanna take this new Blade out for a spin!" 

Mio turned to Noah, asked, "From here, we head due south, right?" He nodded back. 

He turned to the others, "Perfect. We can test them out on the road." He activated his iris, and his clothes returned to his; same with Mio.  

--- 

After a test battle, they sheathed their blades. Noah described his experience to Mio, "I felt a lot more nimble there, like the way you usually fight." 

She looked at him, excited: "It looked like second-nature to you. It was crazy." 

"You should have seen yourself!" 

"Hehe, I think I could've thrashed you! With a little more practice..." 

Eunie turned to Lanz, her hands behind her head, "Y'know, it's totally bananas... Ouroboros is bonkers powerful." 

Lanz was stoked, "Right?" 

Sena activated her iris and looked at Mio, seeing something different. While most of the upper part still blood red, orange started to fill the bottom part, like water in partially-filled bottle. "Ah! The gauge for the locked icon has filled right up!" 

She reaffirmed after doing the same, "Same here!" Turning to Taion, it's no difference.

Taion drew conclusion, "So, logically, if we gain enough experience by fighting together, we'll become able to use each other's classes.That seems to be it." Then, he changed the topic, "As much as I'd like to experiment... " 

Noah read his mind and completed his sentence, "Yeah, I guess we shouldn't stay in one place for too long." 

"Right."

Lanz agreed, "Well, better get ourselves down south!" 

---

In a valley, where lights were poor. Taion called for a pause, "Hold it a moment..." As everyone turned and faced him, he continued, "I have a proposal as to our next route." 

Mio: "OK. Shoot." 

"I'll send you the map data." As they checked their irises, a map with blue dot showed their current location. They were currently at an intersection, with two routes, one to the East, another to the West. "Broadly speaking, it's either east or west. I would suggest we go west." As he finished, he drew a line on the map to visualize. 

"Why's that?" 

"The area to the west is under Agnus's control. There is a certain degree of risk, as they'll have deployed a number of units... but it's the quickest way to get south." 

"What about the east route?" Noah drew a line to the East, prompting for more info. 

To which he replied, "No man's land. None of the colonies have laid claim to it as of yet. However, we'd suffer a significant time loss." 

Sena: "Time... versus risk." 

Lanz was concerned, "Wait a sec. We're gonna stir up the Skeeter nest?" 

Taion looked at him, "I only said there was a 'degree' of risk." He tried to drum it up with livelier tone, "Really, it's not so bad."

Eunie wasn't convinced, wrapping her arms around her chest "But Agnian troops _are_ deployed there, yeah?" 

"Yes." 

"And we're still gonna go?" 

"All I said is that it would be more efficient." 

"Efficient."{{footnote: One didn't recognize whose voice is this, Mio or Eunie.}}

Sena seconded him: "Well, maybe we do need to be more efficient! Faster is better! We don't wanna be dragging our heels forever... right?" 

Mio, with her arms crossed: "Hey! I just have to ask... Are you trying to push some agenda?" 

He was pushing his glasses up (again), perhaps gotten caught? "Wha-? No... Certainly not..." 

"But you admit the east route is the safer option. That's just strange. Why wouldn't you pick the safe way?" Mio pressed for more. 

"Because time is of the-"

She cut him off, "Look. There you go again."

He sighed, continued, "That's not all, though! It's all wasteland to the east. The... the heat! It'll be unbearable!" 

Sena agreed, both hands under her cheeks held into a fist and nodding to her, "Er... Yeah, you're gonna melt in the sun!" 

Mio shook her head, "I'm fine with your choice. But we need to think about everyone's safety." 

Lanz: "Noah, what's your take?" 

"Me? Uhh..." Noah was watching their drama, haven't thought about his own decision. The Agnians turned their focus to him and waited. He looked down for a while, reminiscing his chat with Mio's, on her diary, on how she felt happy speaking to him just like that, on her smile. His raised his head, their eyes met. A few moments later, he seconded Mio's decision, "I think... I'd rather take the safe route." 

Mio nodded back at him, grasping her hands together, palm on fist, putting it to her chest, thanking him in silence. Sena and Taion's slightly closed their eyes, heads tilted down in disappointment. He did not dismiss their worries. "As for the heat... We can probably figure something out."

Lanz: "There. Four against two." 

Taion scoffed. Mio tried to convince the others, "Taion... Sena..." Sena looked towards Taion, he paused. "Please..."

With a sigh, he compromised, "Ngh... Fine, then. If you absolutely insist." Sena nodded back at her. 

With a cheerful tone "Then it's settled!" As she walked towards the east route, taking the lead, "C'mon, cheer up guys! We're outta here!" Everyone followed behind. Noah was last to followed, his eyes on hers as she continued, perhaps relieved to had made her day.

> **Author's Note on Environment:** A tall pillar made of irregular rocks stood in the center. Copper-colored birds with wings stretching meters, like the wandering albatross but not really, one rest on the platform, another flew around. We could also see some deer in the distance with green tails. Also smaller animals like "bunnit" (rabbit with the tail of a squirrel). There were lofty platforms to both sides, like a sandy valley. Plants were rare, with only a few grass stucking out here and there. Behind the scene was a tall bridge that joined both platforms at the entrance. Sand could be seen falling down. There were also red short trees, like those saw in Ethel's colony in the distance as we entered the dune. Most sands were brown, but there was a patch of white sand aggregated as well. Irregular pillars of rock stuck out here and there. There was two platform in the distance, like two fingers about to crush the desert. This is **Eagus Wilderness**, of Fornis Region.

The sun shone brightly on the rocky ground. Behind them, a location with white sand and plantation opened itself up like a fan, or the tail of a peacock. To the authr, its shape seemed to be carved by an annihilation event. The group walked really slowly, with Mio dangling on Sena far behind. Both Sena and Mio took off their jackets. 

"Ugggh... So... hot..." Mio couldn't stand the heat. As if she was about to faint, "Can't... go... on..." Her face all red. Then, she totally put her body weight on Sena. 

Sena: "Keep it together now, Mimi! I'll drag you along myself if I have to!" 

Lanz couldn't believed it, hearing them talk: "I mean, I get that it's hot, but really?" 

Taion explained, "Whether we're talking food or weather, Mio does not take to heat." He looked back at her, "I knew this would happen." 

Noah looked at Lanz, "Heat's never bothered you, has it, Lanz?" 

He smiled and squeezed his left arm to show his biceps, "Nnnope. I'm made of sterner stuff." 

Noah looked back at Mio. Her eyes already closed of the heat. "Honestly, I'm starting to feel a little worn out. Spot to rest would be nice about now." 

Sena saw something, pointed at a direction, "Hey, look! There!" Taion turned to look at her. She was stoked. "Mimi, look! It's water! There's an oasis!" 

"Wa...w-water...?" She tried to make sense of what she told her. Looking at a distance, her vision blurry, she saw something sparkling in the distance, lights shone down on it like a show focusing on a certain event. 

"Yeah, water!" Sena affirmed. 

As her vision retained strength, we could see the water was below a platform, and above the platform, there was a cave entrance. Some blurry object were to the right, shorter distance than the oasis. The oasis was shining brightly, sparkling water drum her up. Suddenly, her eyes wide opened, ears flopped and stood straight. She released her lean on Sena, excited, "Water!!!"

"C'mon! Let's go!" 

"Yeah!" Then she make a run for it, Sena followed behind. Both dashed past the group, pushed towards the side. Taion almost fell. The rest can't believed their eyes.  

Lanz: "Oh, come on. Talk about overreacting." 

Taion: "We should be thankful they're back in high spirits." His Mondo flew up and spun down in slow motion, as if being cheered up. 

Noah wasn't feeling too hopeful, "Let's just hope it's not a mirage..." Then, they took their steps slowly after those two. 

---

Riku and Manana dived underwater, appeared to the surface, floating to their back thereafter. Sena was backstroking as she floats. Mio just floats. "Ahahah! Nice and cool!" Mio enjoyed the temperature as she played with the waters. 

Sena: "Thank the Clock..."

Meanwhile, Eunie had took off her jacket and ready to make for a dive, "Ooooooooh...ahhh" She jumped high into the air, knees and elbows bent, and landed in the center of the four. Water splashed as she dived underwater. Meanwhile, the guys were looking at their show. 

Lanz got his jacket out and put it on the floor. "Aw'right then..." Noah and Taion look at his move as he shook his hands free, "My turn!" 

Noah: "You too?" 

His hands stretched to his back, rolling his heads left right in preparation as he replied, "Don't happen every day!" Then, he ran and jumped, "Yeeeeee...ahhhhhh!" He was aiming at the girls and the nopons. 

Mio and Sena looked at the big shadow coming in their direction, Sena exclaimed, high pitched, "Waah?!" Riku's eyes wide open as he saw him high on the air, perhaps several meters up. He squeezed his arms slightly, high on air, his legs came straight down. He landed in the middle of Mio and the others, water splashed so high, ripple so strong it pushed them back. "Waaaaahhh!" Riku and Manana was pushed underwater, fainted as they floated back up with their buoyancy{{footnote: Ahem, ahem, by physics, their density is smaller than water, hence "buoyancy".}}. 

Eunie breathe in hard as she was choked with water. She turned to face where Lanz dived, "You muppet!" 

As Lanz emerged underwater, more water flew towards Mio. Eunie was angry, "NEVER do that again!" 

Lanz just looked back, excitingly, "C'mon! You're already soaking wet anyway! What difference does it make?" He went on to do freestrokes after he finished his sentence. 

Eunie sniped back, "The difference is, you're an arsehole! What snuffin' difference..." Then, she pat one side of her temple hard with her head rolled in the other direction, "Uggh, I've got water in my ears now...!" 

From a higher place, we could see the water is shadowed by some platform above. The platform where Noah and Taion stood was quite high, relative to the oasis bank on the other side where they're facing. 

Noah and Taion had been watching the drama. Mio and Sena had regrouped. Lanz was freestroke swimming in front, while Eunie was trying to catch him, breast stroke. Noah smiled at their drama. Then, he turned to face Taion, "Staying here, are you?" 

He immediately checked his iris, "I've got something to take care of." A map came up on his iris, "I'll send it to you now." 

Noah checked it. "A map?" 

"From a survey branch." He marked several locations green, big or small, circled. "Annihilation events occur frequently here." 

Noah deactivated his iris and faced him, "Annihilation events? You mean..." 

Two balls of energy, yellow and blue, strikes, like those planets in the prologue. A huge blast of energy released, reminded us of the snowy peak carved into two after such event. 

Taion nodded back. He turned behind where they walked, "Look." 

In the distance was the place where they had came before. The white sand had some stones curved above like a circle carved out of it. (Something weird being a stone remains floating mid-air, which defies gravity, given it's a rock and not some anti-gravity mechanism.) What Mio's blurry range, the item before the oasis, was actually a plant, a low shrub. More trees grew in the distance. At the very far end, there was a platform that stretches out. 

"It happens here too." They turned their attention to the Oasis wall, how it was carved out. 

"Given our route, we should take the safest way possible." He continued. 

"Very cautious of you." 

"It's my duty to be." He continued checking his iris. 

"Thank you." He patted him on his shoulder. 

Taion was shocked, turned his attention to him, "Uh... Sure." He saw him ran to the back, taking off his jacket. Then, he ran, jumped, and dived. Another big water splashed up, and we could hear the girls roared in the distance. "Whoa!"
