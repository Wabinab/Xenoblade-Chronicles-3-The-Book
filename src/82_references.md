1. The cutscenes are taken from [this playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXDE1P7WvI8&list=PLpVpBRIlzWuBPW1F4h7t1bJwl1567hzfY&index=3). As it has no subtitle, one also refer to [this (second) video for the subtitles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnuRO8WfZWc&t=382s&ab_channel=BeardBear). The latter was used most due to the availability of subtitles. Because the cutscenes are separated by game in between, we would join the cutscenes that seems to match a single scene, than to have them slip into separate chapters. The chapters do not match the game chapters, as if it is, it would be too long a single chapter, which isn't (too long) in video but is when put in words. Both these video evade some non-worded cutscenes, with the second totally evading all. Therefore, in case where one think the scene needs inclusion, one'll get it from [this (third) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=me1dXXWnlbM&t=7711s&ab_channel=Gamer%27sLittlePlayground). For the Final Battle, we also used [this (fourth) video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmu-0S4mfaI).
