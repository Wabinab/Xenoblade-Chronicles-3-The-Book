# Isurd, Off-Seer Purpose, Emotional Recourse

(Need to edit the one before this)

> **Translator's Note on Environment:** On the platform where the rusty abandoned wheel we saw before, puny animals (squirrel-like, but looked like bunnits, dark gray) running along the path 'behind' it (if the waterfall where a 'triangle' stood out of it was called 'forward'). Trees, ferns, and grass paved the shoulder of the road. Another scene: Waterfall falling in layers, each step with a platform. Several animals with like 'balls', arranged in a circle, like flower petals, submerged below the water surface in the platform. This drowned platform is accessible from a path to the left of it, seen from image's point of view. An eagle soared above the flower petal animals. There were high-tech buildings at a platform higher than where the flower-petal animals made their home. And of course, trees that grew slightly towards the horizontal, their roots stuck on the vertical platform between the waterfall. Yet another scene. Waterfall scene in the distance, behind some rocks. In between the rocks and the waterfall, some pea-pods like trees stood taller than the rocks, their leaves more blue than green. On the 'pond', high-tech buildings (with glass windows, translucent tiles, or metal-looking structure) buried into the rocks to the right of the image. In front of them, an island with an Agnian levnis. In the same direction, in 'front' of the island, waterfall down to lower level. Final scene: rainbows! Lambda's Ferronis seen on the bottom left of the image, relatively far from the stepped waterfalls. This, is **Great Cotte Falls**, of Pentelas Region.

---

The evening sunlight caressed the soil and water vapor, the latter enshrouded the fallen Ferronis. The group tramped on a shady area of the island. The sound of water fall from behind. Tents laid in front of them, mostly along the rocky walls. Streetlights only lit several areas around the tents. Agnian soldiers laid on the floor. The group stopped before the erected barriers (only to the side, the invisible 'door' had no barriers) to observe the situation. 

Riku: "Everybody flat on ground..." He started running toward the one nearest, the group followed thereafter. They gathered around him/her to inspect his/her situation.{{footnote: Translator couldn't see the face, nor even the head with helmets!}}

Sena: "At least they're breathing."{{footnote: The girl whom stood behind Sena was [Alexandria](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/Alexandria), translator think... If you'd remember Taion asked which path to take before entering the desert, the other path was 'Agnian territory', and yes, it was Colony Iota's territory, Alexandria's the commander.}}

Manana: "Friends all OK?"

Lanz: "Looks like they're just passed out."

Noah: "Even so... There's cause for concern." He looked at Lanz, whom nodded to him. They both, together with Riku, ran into the distance, we don't know what they do, but translator guessed they went to inspect other soldiers. 

Taion stood by himself, confounded by the situation. Eunie and Mio approached him, with Eunie attracting his attention, "Taion!"

"...Uh?" He turned around and faced them. 

"We need to find the real commander, right?"

Mio assured him, "We'll keep an eye on this place. You go and make sure Commander Isurd is safe."

"Wait, but..." He tried refuting unconsciously before his logical mind overrides his unconscious, "...No, sorry, you're right. I'll go now, be back soon!" They watched him off into the distance, Mio doing her appreciation stance. 

As if everything was as before, he had no trouble finding the commander's camp; or maybe it's just too obvious. Isurd and two soldiers, one of the latter not wearing a helmet, laid on the (seemingly) carpeted floor encircled the table. Taion exclaimed, perhaps relieved to see him, "Commander Isurd!!!" He ran and knelt by his side, "...It's good to see you."

---

Laying on a bed, Isurd eyes squinted as his eye muscles relaxed, opened. Translator assumed the place an infirmary, with beds lying on opposite sides like in the real hospital, a path in the middle. The ground was soil, no tiles. There is a tent above, and some foldable 'walls' behind each beds. The tent was unoccupied, only Isurd and Taion. Raising his head while his body laid flat on the bed, his hand on his chest, he turned to the guy sitting beside him, "Taion..." He looked at him without speaking for a moment. 

---

Taion explained the situation to Isurd, whom was sitting up. The group gathered around, sitting on the beds or standing (and Nopons standing on the beds). 

"So that's what happened..." He put his head on his forehead, trying hard to recall but failed. "I'm sorry. I don't remember a thing. Except for that... Consul's silhouette..." 

He looked at Taion, asked, "Did I... say anything to you? I didn't..." then turned to the rest of the group, "say something... hurtful, did I...?" His tone seemed on-the-verge of tears. 

A few seconds of silence, Taion, to not hurt his feelings, answered in a high tone, as if to assure him, "*Not at all...* You were your usual self, Commander. Our pride and joy, the same as always."

Eunie squinted his eyes, "Taion..." The willingness to conceal a painful fact and make someone's day, to bite one own's tongue and no one else. 

Isurd looked into his eyes for a while, before looking down, his eyes closed, I see... I'm sorry." Then, he brought out something from his pocket that took Taion by surprise, 

"I-Is that...?!"

Nimue's stopwatch. He looked at it, reminisced their shared past, as he shared his thoughts of her and him, "Nimue... She always cared so much about you. You possess... an acuity that sets you apart. You'll be an elite, head and shoulders above the likes of us. Nimue... She wouldn't stop going on about you."

Taion shakily breathed out as he listened to him sharing his emotions, eyes fixated on the gadget. The commander raised his head to look at him, "So someone called you a coward? Nonsense." Taion probably tried to hide his tears from him, turned to the other side as Isurd continued, "Considerate's what you are. Perhaps to a fault. You heeded a comrade's opinion. Isn't that right?" He was trying hard to hold his tears from leaking. 

Looking back at the stopwatch, "Here's another thing she mentioned: That if you led us... If we could gain victory through your kindness, she'd have loved to see it." His iris constricted as he was reminded of Nimue's final moments, her look, her hopes, passed on to him. He closed his eyes to shed tears, clenched his fist. 

Isurd stood up in front of Taion and handed over the stopwatch, "Even if it's too much, it should be yours to carry." Taion looked up at him, to which he nodded in assurance. He took two steps forward, received the stopwatch into his hands. 

"And if you keep it safe... someday... I'd like you to go visit her."

"Huh? How can I... visit...?" Taion reflexively, shockingly, asked, the second tone softer as his mind figured it may just be a dream that can't be fulfilled. 

Anyways, he attentively listened as Isurd continued, "At the Cadensia frontier, beyond the Farlaine Underpass, there's a place where Saffronias bloom. Nimue always loved their flowers... And one of them was especially brilliant... I'd like you to bury it there." As he returned his look on the stopwatch, he groaned in pain, heart pain, and clenched his fist around the gadget. 

"That'll show her, beyond all doubt, your victory through kindness." Taion closed his eyes, brought the gadget to his chest, and embraced.

Taion seemed to leave the commander's tent, the group was waiting for him outside, Mio asking, "How's Commander Isurd?"

"It sounds like he's eager to jump back into work. I do wish he'd rest up first, but... That's the kind of man he is."

Sena: "...Ah, um, good to hear he's feeling well, at least..."

Noah added: "The other soldiers are waking up, too."

Taion nodded, "Very interesting."

Lanz nudged, "Someone should bring them up to speed, but we're just outsiders, after all... This is your manor, right? You should do the honors and fill everyone in." 

"That is being taken care of. Commander Isurd is going to get the colony troops back in line shortly."

Eunie: "OK... So, it sounds like it's fine for us to just walk around like normal then."

Noah and Mio, standing beside each other, turned and look at each others' eyes. They nodded to each other in assurance as Noah voiced out, "On that note, there's something I'd like to check."

Mio added, "Taion, will you come along?"

"...Huh...? Sure. Where are we going?"

Mio, in her appreciation stance, replied, "Out of Colony Lambda."

Encircled by the remains of mud puppets, Noah and Mio played the melody. Blue moats rose from the remains{{footnote: Again, rendering error, please see second video.}} Agnian soldiers gathered behind them, watching them sending them off. Sena, Lanz, Riku, and Manana too, but they weren't standing with the other soldiers. They were facing the direction of the bridge, in front of a waterfall. 

Soldiers did the Agnian welcoming stance{{footnote: Clench your right hand into a fist and put it by your heart.}} as they sent their colleagues off. Others too sad just stood still, shaking their heads sometimes. 

"They were literal clods, man. Nobody's actually died. Who you doin' that for?" Lanz, arms crossed, wasn't convinced of their acts. 

"Lanz got no tact. Do too... is about... atoning." Riku lectured, as if he knows a lot about it.

Sena was equally confused, "Riku, whatcha sayin' there?"

Riku recalled the same question he directed at Noah earlier, while they were walking out of Lambda. 

> Noah: "Why are we seeing them off? I know they were only hollow vessels... But ultimately, _we_ chose to fight... and kill them... And nothing can change that fact. Even if there's no one to actually see off, we have to atone for that."

"In nutshell..."

Sena: "Oh, I see..." 

"Atonement, huh...?" Lanz looked up at the two, unsure if he's convinced or not. Taion was far behind Lanz and Sena, watching the scene too. 

Eunie voice appeared from behind as she walked to join him, "Hey, is Isurd OK with this? It's kinda... "

"Yeah!... He doesn't mind."

"Allll right... Guess you're all weirdos. Still, kinda strange. I wonder when it all started..." 

"I couldn't tell you exactly when, but, I would surmise it started out as a kind of process for the upkeep of the world." 

"Sounds like a crazy kind of process. This is all going way over my head." She crossed her arms. 

Taion provided a cogent reason, "Quite simple actually. It gives a sense of security. Lets you think your dead friends are looking out for you from above. Alleviating feelings of guilt, and of loss. That's how I understand it."

"Yeah, OK, but... Ain't there plenty of people who don't care about that?" She recalled how Noah used to atone for dead Agnian and Kevesi soldiers after the battle with the Dirt Rank in Colony 9. Soldiers stepped on other corpses, levnises trampled their way through. 

"***What matters is that it is there. You don't need to pay attention. You don't need to do anything. But the way it is designed, if you think about it, it just works.*** We are told our life is born from the Queen, and to the Queen it returns. However, that's only if you make it to your Homecoming. But what of the others...? What of those who fall on the battlefield? Nobody knows. Where do they go? Seeing motes rise into the sky serves to dispel any unease. You end up believing, well... They're going *somewhere*. "

Eunie looked up to him, prompted for more, "But where is... 'somewhere'? The Queen's place?"

He looked back at her, "No clue..."

"You what, mate? That's kinda noncommittal for you." She put her hands behind her heads. 

"Disappointed?" He teased back, looking at her. 

"Nah, not fussed." Together, they embraced the moments the moats floated into the sky, grief over the dead while enjoying the silence, as the melody was coming to an end.

===

Resting outside Colony Lambda's garrison, but inside the waterfall. By a table, Manana was preparing the dishes, Sena helping out, seemingly cutting something. Mio took a ladle of soup, blew into it, and tasted it. 

"Urg, ahh..." It was still too hot for her tongue. Manana and Sena just happily watched her. It seemed like tomato soup? There were also cabbages. 

Suddenly, someone sounded from behind, "You lot, why're you making that stuff out here?" They turned to face him. It was Lanz asking. "Colony's got a perfectly good kitchen."

Noah was practicing sword slicing, as usual, outside the Colony{{footnote: Very near to the edge where water falls and formed a misty sheathe.}}. He turned to watch where the girls were cooking. 

Mio, embarrassedly chuckled, replied, "Out of commission, apparently." Then, folded her arms, "_Somebody_ made a real mess of the place."

Sena looked back at her, agitated, "Wh... Hold on a sec!"

Lanz turned away, apologizing, "Sorry, Mio..." Then, he walked away, they watched him off. 

Sena tried to explain herself to Mio, stuttering, "I-... If we hadn't done what we did, chances are we would've all been dead by now! Uh, th-that's why we...!"

Mio, frivolously{{footnote: took it lightly.}} assured, "It's all right, everyone understand why. You were really brave, Sena."

"Uh... really? You're not just saying that?"

"N-Nope!"

At another place, Riku laughed uncannily, "Meh-heh-hehhh! This real thrill of travel! Excitement moun-TINGGGG!!!" Looking into his toolbox, there was a Mondo, some circular disc with blue inner rings and metal outer rings, and some black matted surface inside the blue ring; a cup with handle; an empty Ether cylinder. 

Noah looked at him, felt estranged at his gleefulness. Then, Lanz approached the two, sighing, "Hah... Seriously... Nopon can be a bit too easygoing." As he finished his comments, he walked off into the distance. Riku watching him off. 

As he walked, Noah sounded from behind, focused on his sword, their backs facing each other, "Everyone deals with things in their own way."

"Is that right? And why are _you_ acting all normal?" He turned to him, "It was Joran! He was... He looked just like his old self!"

Noah turned to him, putting his sword down, snapped with serious looks, "I suppose... you think you're the reason for that, do you?"

"Huh?"

"In that case, I'm tell you to drop it *right now*. So Joran turned up. That alone isn't so bad."

Pugnaciously, he rebutted, "'Course it is!"

"Figuring out why it happened... That's what we should do!"

"Whaddya mean... 'why it happened'...?"

He turned to his right and walked a few steps, Lanz's eyes on him, as he continued, "The reason we became Ouroboros... The reason the world looks like this. It's all connected... I'm sure of it..."

Lanz, superciliously, "Or maybe you just want it that way."

Noah accepted it, turned to face him, "Better than being stuck in the past."

"Uhhh..." Lanz felt hearthurt. His head down, announced "I won't... I can't... **I'll NEVER SNUFFING FORGET!!!**" Then, he walked away towards the waterfall, all tensed. Noah watched him off. 

Then, he looked to his right, where the Ferronis had fallen in the pond, thought to himself, "_There shouldn't be any life in those bodies... But the motes still rose... So that means... I knew it._"

He brought out his flute as he recalled.

#### (Start of Noah's Memories)

An evening after a battle. Transporting levnises parked above a platform; another levnis drove down a hill. Noah, in his Kevesi uniform, stood slightly below the tallest hill, overlooking the battlefield. Someone sounded from beside (or behind?) him. 

"The dead don't think anything. They don't speak." He turned to face him, he slowly walked up to him. It's the guy whom he was looking up at during the Homecoming when he was younger. "But... survivors speak for them. To celebrate their life... and death." He walked in front of him and past, stopped at the edge, "That's why... I'm here." He brought out his flute and played a melody, blue moats rose from the ground, both Kevesi and Agnian. 

Transporting levnises could be seen retreating their feet and zoomed off into the distance. Soldiers with tired feet weakly pushed forward. Noah listened to him playing the melody, a different one from the usual Kevesi melody, perhaps one he invented. 

#### (End of Noah's Memories)

With his flute held up, he looked at the distant where Lanz strode away, "Lanz... _We_ are still alive..."

---

Outside the Colony, A levnis parked outside. To its 7 o'clock, there was a giant rock. Eunie took steps towards it as she called out to Lanz, "It ain't like you to sulk like this."

"Piss off..."

"Noah bust your chops?"

"Urg..." He faced away from her. 

With a joking look, "Mmm-hmm... **Maybe** not, but I'm getting warmer." Then, she dropped and sat to his left. 

Lanz sneered at her, "Eunie, for sparks' sake, read the room."

Hushed, she replied, "Hard pass. Look Lanz, I was there too."

"Ahhh!" Lanz whimpered. 

"No one's asking you to forget. Noah's just saying, move on."

"Ah, Noah. He's always a step ahead, eh?"

"You know he's an off-seer. He's closer to it all than we are. To the ones who're gone..."

"Being left, it... It ain't easy." He now spoke softly. 

"I know. Still... I don't wanna disappear."

They enjoyed a moment of silence, recourse with his feelings, before Lanz agreed, "Yeah. Yeah, you're right. Not like... we can afford to go just yet." The mist blew in the distance as they watched the teeth-looking pillars of rock in the distance, with black fog enshrouded to their 11 o'clock.
