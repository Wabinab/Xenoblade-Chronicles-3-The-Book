# Isurd, Off-Seer Purpose, 

(Need to edit the one before this)

> **Translator's Note on Environment:** On the platform where the rusty abandoned wheel we saw before, puny animals (squirrel like, but looked like bunnits, dark gray) running on the path 'behind' it (if where it face was the waterfall was called 'forward'). Trees, ferns, and grass paved the shoulder of the road. Another scene; several layers of waterfall, creating ponds (submerged platforms) in between. Some animals with flower-like "petals" on their back submerged below the water surface, displaying only their "petals". A path led down towards this drowned platform. An eagle soared above them. We could also see some remnants of "high-tech" building at a platform taller; and of course, trees that grow slightly horizontal, their roots stuck to the vertical platform. Yet another scene, perhaps the top of the waterfall. The remnants of "high-tech" building in the background, an Agnian levnis positioned itself on an island in front of the building. Behind some rocks, there were huge avatar-like trees (with 'pea-pods' on its tips, and blue-ish leaves.) A rainbow formed where water vapor was available. Lambda's ferronis positioned itself at the bottom of the waterfall, near where they fought. This, is **Great Cotte Falls**, of Pentelas Region.
