# Memories: Silvercoat Ethel

Flames burning in the night. Agnian levnises rounded up against a Kevesi's, it dropped and exploded. More Agnian levnises marched forward, destroying everything it rolled into. As they moved, they searched for signs of living Kevesi. 

The young Noah, hiding behind an obstacle with Eunie, seen the scanning levnises disappeared into the distance. He signaled to Eunie with his right hand, whom nodded her head, then ran off the other direction. Noah followed behind. 

Lanz sobbed while he ran, his arms wiping his tears. Noah shouted at him from beside, "Stop crying, Lanz! It won't change anything! For now, just run!" He seemed to listen, putting his arms into a running pose. Riku and another guy (maybe Garland?) were running with them. 

Eunie signaled, "Noah! Over here!" She pointed at a direction. "We can go through here, and then we're out!" As she finished, she made a turn to the right. 

"All right!" 

An Agnian levnises emerged from the junction along their escape route. Eunie cried, "Oh no!"

"Sparks! We almost made it..." Noah exclaimed as they backed down in small steps, away from the levnis. 

Too late. The levnis spotted them, it's beam weapon preparing to fire. 

Before it does, someone ran above the roof beside it, jumped off the roof, dove down and sliced. In a moment, the levnis bursted into flames as the young soldier covered their face with their arms. Black smoke washed over them. When they looked, a young girl about their age, maybe slightly older, wielding two swords, silver hair reaching her neck, landed on the fallen levnis. She turned and faced the kids. We could now see that she had silver iris, pointed chin. Her term symbol located at her breast.

After the battle. Soldiers gathered in 3 to 5 around a fireplace, with many set up. Some walked around. They all were quiet, looking down. Lanz had his hands over his face, as if to hide his tears, or to pinch his nose to silence from crying out aloud. 

The silver-haired girl approached, took a moment to catch eye contact with Eunie and Noah before turning her attention at Lanz. She lowered her head, her chin almost touching her chest, "I'm sorry..."

Noah looked up at her, "Huh?" 

"If I'd been just a bit faster, I could have saved many more lives..." It looks as if there were tears in her eyes; or maybe, she was just blaming herself. Silence filled the air. 

Noah broke the silence, "Uh, who are-?" 

She looked up, smiled at him, "I'm **Ethel**, from Colony 4."

Eunie exclaimed, "Silvercoat Ethel...! She pushed her Colony, all the way to rank Silver, and in her third term at that." 

"Some do call me that.", then she lightened her voice, "However, a person's worth isn't in their color. It's here." She touched her heart. Noah seemed shocked. 

She turned and scanned Noah's blade, still held in his hands, eyes widened. "Nice Blade you've got." Then, she turned and walked off into the distance before he could say anything. He and Eunie watched her disappeared into the night sky.

In a theatre. A projector was replaying the fight scene between the ouroboros and the moebius earlier. It's a huge room. The projected screen seemed small compared to it's volume, and perhaps only occupied a-fifth of the front wall. We could see some storey-like structure on both side of the walls,{{footnote: Unsure if people could stand there or just decorations}} with many seats laid on a single floor, like that of a Church, one behind another. 

As the screen turns dark, the room lost all its illumination. The moebius that fought at Melnath's Shoulder a while ago walked into the room, still in its gigantic form, "Wow, tough guys, eh? It's a wild ride, this 'passage of fate'. We got ourselves a nice little awakening."

A light shone on a red-suit humanoid, as if she{{footnote: Feminine determined based on voice, and perhaps, one's biases and prejudices on higher tone seemed feminine, though it isn't always true.}} was staged. Her hand by her waist, wearing a helmet that covered everything but her eyes (as usual); her helmet had a ring about her chin, with a crown-like structure above her head. "You were all talk when you left here, but you've nothing to show for it, **D**."

"Oh, spare me, **P**. "After all, I did precisely what I was meant to do." As he finished the sentence, he transformed into the red-suit form. We could see his mask having two horns, with two artefacts dangling near its tips like earrings. The top of the helmet had a flat surface, 45Â° to the horizontal, reflected light brightly. Behind him, a joker face like helmet moebius was seen... or was it his tail, if he had one? 

P: "So? About that _huge_ bet of yours... Pray tell us, who won?"

Another moebius came into the scene. He looked chubby, his helmet seen like a chicken head with a crown from the side. From the front, two fan-shaped horn protruded from the top of his nose. He also had a really high collar, like a wall that blocked a third of the back of his head. "Pah... A draw, I think. And with two whole Colonies on the field! We should've sallied forth in the first place. The whole thing would've been done by teatime. (urghahahaha)"

A new moebius, mouth with a protruding structure that resembles a machine gun, rebuted: "It was J who insisted on it. I'd thought that that had already been communicated." It looked like some semiconductor-colored flat pieces protrude parallel to the top of his head, slightly longer towards his back, like a cap with a tongue wore backward. 

A female moebius walked in from behind the machine-gun mouth moebius, from his right to his left. We could see short dangling tentacles (hardened) from her side of her forehead. "In that case... I believe it's my turn next..."

The machine guy rebuted, again: "**H**, I'm pretty sure you already had your kicks the other day when you wiped out Colony 8, no? Surely the turn is mine." 

A guy with some purple specks flowing like fire, we could see his long hair, but not other features given that he's not under a spotlight, joined in, "Honestly, you make more noise than the rabble at a feast..." 

All the moebius turned to face him, "**Z**!"

"Even if you did stop its raging flow, it will soon burst through. All it takes is the slightest fissure."

"And that is fate... I told you before, haven't I, D?" The moebius whom without a helmet, with red lines forming their body sketches, walked in. This is the special moebius we saw earlier.{{footnote: Recall the last guy whom looked at the projected moebius symbol when they transformed to ouroboros the last time.}} He had an X behind his chest. Behind him, another moebius, also red light shaping his/her body structure, with a ">" symbol but facing the mouth of that symbol facing upwards, carved to his/her chest. As The X guy finished, the X symbol flickered. 

D folded his hands around his chest, "Bah... The gang's all here again." 

After a moment of silence, Z closed his eyes, the X-symbol guy asked, "K... Will you go?" 

A new moebius with round head, like those of a motorcycle helmet, and a fan protruding from his shirt, like those really long collars that stuck out, rising so high it's almost as tall as his head, get into the scene. "If you say I go... I go." As he finished, he teleported, purple particles floating around. Light turned off. 

As the decision was made, other moebius teleported away, lights off.

Z: "Well then... Let us see how far the flow brings them this time..." All lights turned off.
