# A Dragon,

Outside Lambda, the group gathered together, where the Ferronis and the waterfall behind the scene. Eunie was playing with the tip of her wings, Lanz stretching. Manana jumped and fluttered as she happily spoke with Noah. With his hands at the back of his head, Lanz announced to Noah and Mio, "Ready to go!"

Noah: "OK, then let's go."

Riku asked, "How we go on from here?"

Eunie complaint, "I got completely turned around in all those sparking tunnels, and then the joyride down those rapids... I've got to say, I have absolutely no sparking clue where we are." She probably didn't like the last part of their journey, folding her arms together. 

Taion flipped his hair as he backed her up, "You needn't worry on that count. Commander Isurd provided us with the necessary topographical data."

"Oh, nice! Legend." She was amazed! 

As he transferred the data to their Iris, he continued, "All the water that runs from the Urayan mountains makes for difficult terrain. Actually, rather than constantly checking the data and explaining myself, I think it'd be better if I just tell you where to go..."

Lanz agreed, "Yeah, sounds good. Lead the way!"

Sena seconded, "Totes! We have every faith in you, Taion!"

"This is the bottom of the waterfall. Let's see if we can get to the middle level first."

Noah asked, "Should we aim to get above Colony Lambda?"

"Basically, yes." He looked into the distance where the bridge we saw from earlier when fighting Joran. There was a platform at the end of the L-shaped bridge, connected to the shallow water, sloped upwards. "To get to the middle levels, we'll need to head up and around."

"Got it."

Manana punched her wings into the air, "Departure time!" Lanz took the lead as the group followed. Mio fell behind as she met with Taion and asked, 

"Did you get to say everything you wanted to say to Commander Isurd in the end?"

"...More or less."

In her appreciation stance, she felt relieved, "Well... OK, that's good." Taion facial expression seemed more regret than relieved, though. As he turned to look behind Mio, where the Ferronis stood, perhaps it brought back memories for a moment. 

Then, turning back towards Mio, he urged, "Let's go." Mio watched him walked a few steps before following behind...

(Somewhere, at some time, on their path)

The group withdrew their blades as a purple winged dragon, four horns with blue carvings on them, blocked their way. There were also illuminated blue carving on its feet. ITs tails were strong and spiky; it's wings, stretched out, bony... It roared at them, its tongue jiggered as it roared.

(Some time into the battle)

Lanz's Ouroboros was overheating, with an emergency sound, as it dragged backwards towards where Riku and Manana were hiding. It punched its hands into the ground to increase drag. The dragon was still standing, rotate its head from left to right as it roared out, so loud it released shockwaves into the air. 

"Would you just... **DIE** already!" He ran towards the dragon while it was busy roaring, and punched upwards on its chin, decapacitating it immediately, dust and soil splattered around where it fell. One side of the surrounding were tall cliff walls. 

"Huh..." Lanz puffed out, relieved that it had finally gone. His ouroboros weren't the only one overheating; we could see Noah's Ouroboros behind overheating as well. Steam were evaporating from their Ouroboros. "Ahh... Finally..." As Lanz tried to wiped his sweat, or perhaps scratched his head, it burned him, "Ugh... Ugh...!" He immediately cancelled the Interlink; the group followed. 

On the other side of the cliff wall was a pond where water falls to; we could see the high tech building and another waterfall far behind. Scratching his head, Lanz asked, "Hey, can we do something about this sparking noise?"

Eunie and Taion walked up to join him, with Eunie equally had no solution for it, "How would I know? Just cancel the Interlink or something, I guess." She folded her arms, while Taion folded one arm, another hand clenched softly and put in front of his mouth, elbow rested on his folded arm, in his thinking position. 

Noah looked to the ground as his arms folded, thinking and reported his findings, "It only starts after an extended period after our bodies start to heat up." 

Taion added, "To me it sounds like a warning. For something."

Mio: "A warning... Mmm... What do you think'll happen if we leave it?" The group was eager to know. 

"Huh...? I don't have much desire to find out." He pushed his glasses up as he confidently replied. 

Sena turned to Lanz, prompted, "Think it's something... dangerous?"

To which Lanz replied, "Well it can't be anything fun. You expect balloons and confetti with that noise?" 

"Maybe not."

Noah, his palms held out in front of him as he looked at them, "Hmm..." We don't know what he saw.

Inside the dark Moebius theatre, lights lit up as Moebius arrived on the scene. 

The female chef-hat shaped helmet spoke first, "Aww, too bad, J!"

Joran, his helmet wore back up, stared at her without saying anything. 

The fat moebius, fan-shaped extended from his eyebrow, always partnering with the female, teased, "Hnnnnnngh! Looks like that backfired on you, didn't it? *Better be prepared for the consequences.*"

"Really? I was only interested in putting in an appearance. You're making it sound like I took some huge risk." He folded his arms, patiently questioned the fat guy's assumption. 

"Ahhh, come on now, guys." The moebius with earrings on his horn, cow-shaped head, probably the moebius they first fought in the end of Chapter 1, "J's been on the bench all this time. I get why he might be a little stimulated by a bit of drama."

J put his arms behind his head, backed his explanation, "Well it was pretty dramatic, I'll give you that. Heheheheheheheh..."

Another female sounded voice, with two 'throngs' upwards like the mouth of beetles, commented but wasn't very pleased herself, "Hah. You seem pleased with yourself."

"P... O..." A female voiced Moebius joined in and cut any replies; her helmet like butterfly wings stretched behind her head. The fat guy and his partner turned to face her as she continued, "N wants to see you."

The female voiced, unsure it was **P** or **O**, replied, "Does he now?"

The fat guy, as if tasted delicious food: "Hmm! Is it our turn to shine?" He put his hands around his waist, guessed. 

"I don't know. I've got zero idea what's going through his brain, sometimes." She shook her head instead. 

"Not even you?" The cow-helmet asked, hands folded. 

To which she replied, "I'm sure **M** could tell you. Not that she's shown herself recently."

"Hmmm....." He didn't seemed dare to reply anything to that. 

"What could it be?" The female among the pair considered the possibilities, "I do hope it's something fun. Let's be off, O." Ok, so *she is P, and the fat guy, O*. 

He turned to look at her, "Righty-O!" They both teleported away immediately, turning into purple speckles. The rest of the group watched as the light beams that shone on them disappeared one by one (though purple particles didn't evaporate if they had teleported after the beams went off). 

J stood for a while in the theatre alone, gave his wishes, "Have a good one! Heheheheheh...." and went offline.
