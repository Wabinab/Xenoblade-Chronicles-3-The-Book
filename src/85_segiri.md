# More About Segiri

===

Traversing the icy mountains, the group met 3 invisible tiny levnises (human shaped, not larger than them, seen before in Maktha Wildwood once after they leave Juniper and the others) appeared before them. 

The group was immediately alerted, with Noah sounding distressed, "What's this now?!"

The levnises immediately summoned their double-handed axes. Lanz: "Seriously? More of those mudders, come to ruin our day again?!"

Sena summoned her hammer, suggested, "Let's ruin theirs first!" Seeing no other choices than encounters, the others prepared for the fight. 

---

During the fight, one slash or a knock sent the levnises back, sparking electricity. Mio launched herself towards them; the groups had some distance in between. "**Haaaaaaaa!!**" She aimed for the central one, but the one to her right came out and blocked her, 1v1.  

"**Mimi!**" The levnis put her axe up to the left, signaling the other two to retreat first. Then, it faced the group itself, walking slowly towards the group. 

Noah: "**Incoming!**"

Taion: "A tactical retreat?" Then, he attacked it, helped by Eunie; but the levnis easily blocked their attacks by axe slashes. Then, it dashed towards the group. 

"**Lanz!**" Noah and Lanz therefore started dashing towards the levnis. 

"Yeah, I got it!" Both of them blocked two of the axes. Then, he called out, "Sena! Hit 'em where it hurts, will ya?"

"**AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!**" And it shattered the chest of the Levnis, revealing a female inside. Sena was shocked at what she'd revealed, sheathed her weapons after the broken Levnis hit the floor, and dashed towards her. The Flame Clock was still attached to the Levnis, glowing pink; it was one-sixth filled. "Huh! What the...?" The female had short (neck-long) gray hair, one side covering one of her eyes. She wore a collar glowing pink, and a dark vest. Her smash had been strong; she was unconscious, stunned. "What's going on here...?"

---

They got the female out laying on the floor, while Riku went to fix the Levnis. Manana was taking care of her. The group gathered around to discuss. Noah started the conversation, "Who is this girl...? Where did she come from? For a soldier, she's awfully, uhm..."

Eunie folded her arms, "Yeah, I know what you mean. She looks about three terms old. Way too young to be fighting on the front lines."

Lanz: "Not to derail on the convo, but are we sure she'll be OK? We pulled her outta the Lev, but is there anything else we can do?"

Taion stated his observations, "I don't see any external injuries, but no signs of waking up either. Hard to tell either way."

"Uhm..." Sena was in her self-defeating mode again, blaming herself. 

Mio saw her actions and comforted her, "Sena, don't worry. She's still alive. I'm sure she'll pull through."

"_Mimi... You sure...?_"

Eunie: "Look, we can talk about her all day, or we can find her a doctor. I know which one I'd prefer."

Taion: "All right, but she and her people did assault Colony soldiers, so taking her to a Colony seems like asking for trouble."

Noah suggested, "Then how about the City? They have medical facilities there."

"Indeed. Seems advisable."

Lanz hadn't forgotten, "What do we do about the Levnis?"

Noah shook his head, "Let's leave it for now. Transporting the girl should take priority."

Sena volunteered, "Uhm, I can carry her!"

Mio: "Thanks, Sena. She'll be in good hands."

"Yeah, I'll make sure of it."

---

At the City, the group met with the doctor's aide. "Ah, you're here. About the girl we transferred here... She's just woken up."

Sena: "Whoa! Really?"

"Yeah. Although, I should say, she's a little, uhm..." What's the correct word to describe her situation?

Taion prompted, "Were there any complications?"

"**No, nothing like that.** Or at least, nothing to complain to you about."

Eunie: "You're not making sense, and it's getting me antsy."

"The doctor said she didn't need any medical attention, and... You know what, why don't you just talk to her yourselves? Just bear in mind, she's still a patient, so take it easy on her, eh?" And he walked away.

Taion concluded, "Seems at least they kept her safe... But now what?"

Eunie: "_Yeah, it ain't like we can just leave her here forever..._"

Noah suggested, "Let's talk to her first, like he said. We should try to learn more."

Lanz: "All right, but she's recently injured. We probably shouldn't all, _crowd_ her."

Mio: "You're right. If we're just asking questions, one person should be enough."

"Hmph. That sounds like a plan. So who'll go?" Taion questioned.

Lanz assumed "Surely it's Eunie, right? She deals with injured people all the time, she should be right at home."

Eunie teased him back, "Oh yeah? Cheers for volunteering me."

Sena unwaveringly interrupted, "I'll go."

"You, Sena? Why the sudden impulse?" Mio felt weird.

"Well, it's probably my fault she's like this..."

Lanz: "It was really more like an accident, y'know. There's no need for you to feel responsible."

"It's not that exactly, i-it's more like... If I don't do something, erm, I..." She tilted her head to think, "I'll have a dirty, con... urgh con... **con**-science?"

Taion: "You've never heard that word out loud, have you?"

And she dropped her head, "Orggggg...." Feels like about to cry! 

Noah: "Well then, we'll leave the girl to you. Is that all right, Sena?"

"Yeah, I'll be fine."

Eunie: "Do be careful though. She might be meek now, but keep in mind she and her mates came after us."

 "We'll be right outside. If anything happens, just shout."

"I can handle myself, Mimi. _But thanks, I will._"

---

"OK then, I'm going in." And she entered the room herself while the rest waited outside. "Ah...!" The girl already seated on the bed, looking innocent. She had crimson iris, now that she opened her eyes. And a long single braided pony tail that reached her ass. The room was like a hostel room rather than a hospital room, so there was only bed and some furniture. 

"Hmm..."

"Urrr, ummm... **Hi!** I-I see you've woken up!"

"Hmmm...."

"How are you feeling? Any pain?"

"Can confirm faint sensation of pain in cranial region. However, operational efficiency of No. 7 remains unaffected." 

"**Whuh?!**" And she scratched her head, trying to comprehend what had just been said. "Ah, O-OK... That's... _good...?_{{footnote: Good my arse.}} Actually, I'd, uhm... I'd like to apologize heh..."

"Hmmm...."

"Before, I didn't realize you were inside that thing, and..."

"Hmm..."

"Erm, are you OK?"

"No major issues detected."

"I-I see... Uh... Anyway, if it's all right with you, could you tell me something about yourself?"

"The question lacks specificity. No. 7, cannot respond."

And she was back scratching her head, "Oh, I'm really sorry! I-I guess that was _a bit wishy-washy, huh_... Well, for starters, then... Are you a Kevesi soldier? Or are you Agnian?"

"Keves... Agnus..."

"Yeah, that's right. You must know those, right?"

"Affirmative. However, discrepancy was encountered while processing query."

"_Huh? What do you mean?_"

"Affiliation of No. 7 does not match either of two options provided."

"Doesn't match...? Well then, that only leaves..."

And she answered her before she make any guesses, "Special mobile combat unit under direct Moebius command, alias... Colony 0."

"Whoa! You know about Moebius?"

"Affirmative."

"Then, when you attacked us..."

"Colony 0 soldiers of numbers 7 and below were tasked with eradication, of Ouroboros."

"Whhh-whoa, that's... _not great._" And thinking in her head, "_So this girl really **is** our enemy... I have to warn the others...!_" And she took another look at her innocency and second-questioned her thoughts, "_Although... Is that really true? She did attack us... So why is she like this now?_" And she closed her eyes to think for a while what to do with her before making her decision. Sena asked, "Uhm, what you just told me... It sounded really important. Won't you get in trouble for saying it?"

"I was not ordered to silence on the matter."

"I, _I see, OK..._ Oh, shoot, I forgot to introduce myself! My name is Sena. What's yours?"

"I have no name."

"Huh?"

"No. 7, does not possess information, under the category, 'name'."

"You don't have a name? Wait, so this, 'number seven' thing you've been saying all along...?"

"An individual identification number assigned to soldiers of Colony 0. We do not belong, to Keves, or Agnus. We are special assets. Publicly, we do not exist. Consequently, records of personal information stored in growth modules, are also expunged, at the time of birth."

"_That's... crazy..._"

"Shall I consider the questioning to be over?"

"No wait! What you just said... _You don't think it's strange?_"

"Cannot, ascertain, purpose of question. Requesting additional, clarification."

"I mean, for example... That name thing! A Colony that calls people by a number, that's so dehumanizing... Don't you feel bad to be called like that? I mean, you're the same as us after all..."

"Cannot ascertain purpose of question."

And she started feeling pity for her, "_Hrrrhhh... Ohh..._" She can't even fathom what it meant by dehumanizing. 

She urged, "Requesting clarification." And Sena just started sobbing. She didn't answer her, turned around and went out of the room. 

---

"Sena?... **Hey**, you OK?" Lanz was concerned, seeing her face. 

Eunie added, "Did you learn anything?... _Hang on, love, you don't look so good._"

Mio: "What happened, Sena?"

With a sobbing tone, "_Mimi, I... I...! I don't know what to do..._"

Noah reassured, "Hey, Sena, everything's fine. Let's go somewhere we can talk. Is that all right?"

"_Y-yeah, sure..._"

---

Seated at the square park outside where they were permitted to cook in a square (not circle), after the group listened to the intel she'd gathered, Noah exclaimed, "'Colony 0'...? Wow,... they did seem like more than regular soldiers, but that's wild..."

Eunie: "If they're palling around with Moebius, we can't really ignore them, I suppose."

Taion suggested, "We still have very little information. I think a more thorough investigation is in order."

Lanz: "OK, but we're talking about a tiny third-termer here."

"Hurrr..." 

Mio noticed there was still something in her head, questioned, "Sena, what do you think?"

"_Huh?_ Wh-what do I think about what?"

"You're the one that spoke with her. What's your gut telling you?"

"I just... I just asked questions, and she just, answered them. But... Even though she attacked us, she doesn't seem hostile or violent... And when I spoke to her, she was literally just answering questions, it didn't feel like a conversation at all... She looks like us, but is actually a **whole** different kind of _being... That's how I felt_.. a-and then I got scared of her, and..."

"Aw, I'm sorry, Sena..."

Noah: "_Sena, give us your honest opinion. Do you think she's an enemy?_"

"I don't really know yet. That's kind of why I..." And she strengthen her mind, "I'd like to try talking to her again, _I think._"

Lanz can't understand, "Whaddya mean? You just said you were **scared** of her."

"I am, it's true, but... _I want to make sure_ I got the right idea, and that's, stronger than my fear. Not just about if she's an enemy, but, also about who she _actually_ is, how she thinks and feels..."

"Ahh I get it. You need a bit more time for that, sure."

"Right. I also want to say sorry for leaving without saying anything, _last time..._"

Eunie: "OK then, if you're doing a house visit and apologizing at once, how about a little gift, _to grease the wheels?_"

That excites Mio somewhat, "**Oh! Sena, you could bring her your onigiri!**"

"Onigiri?" Noah clearly hadn't heard about that before (and perhaps not seen in her memories). 

Taion explained, "It's a portable Agnian snack, made of packed, boiled mythrice."

Mio added, "They're lovely and salty, especially the way Sena makes them! They **really** hit the spot after a **long** training session."

Lanz was probably the most surprised, "**Huh, you can make food...?**"

"**O-of course I can!...** Onigiri at least. _Oh, wait..._ But we don't have any mythrice..."

Taion suggested, "They should have decent reserves in Colony Lambda."

Eunie instantly snapped, "Hey, nice...!" Then, her brain recoiled on her, "No, hang on, **how did you know that** off the top of your head?"

"Commander Isurd likes them. The onigiri."

Lanz: "Well, that's just peachy then. Hope he doesn't mind sharing."

"_Thanks, you guys!_"

---

At the Michiba Kitchen, she scratched her head in front of the ingredients. "Man, I haven't made onigiri in a minute... _Hope I can still shape them right!_"

---

After she got the finished products, she congratulated herself, "Ahh, that's nice! Now, let's take them to our patient."

---

Before entering the room, Taion interrupted, "Sena, wait. This time around, we'd like to sit in on the conversation too."

"Huh? But I thought..."

Lanz reassured, "No worries, we'll hang back and watch. We're happy to let you do the talking."

"Um, OK then, if you say so..."

No. 7 saw she was back with the group waiting behind. She stood in front, "Hey, sorry to intrude... Can we have a moment?" She was still sitting on the bed. 

"No objections. You wish to resume questioning."

She shook her head, "N-no, that's- not why I'm here. _It's just that last time, I was kinda rude..._ So, to apologize, I thought I'd visit again and, **bring you** a little something."

---

On the table laid down her masterpiece. No. 7 had moved herself to sit in front of the onigiri. "**Hmmm!!!**"

"I figured you might be hungry. They're called onigiri..."

"Yes."

Scratching her head, she explained herself, "I'm not very good at this, so they're about the only thing I can make..."

"Yes."

"**But I can guarantee they're tasty,** and actually Mimi says so too... Ah, Mimi, I mean Mio, she's..."

"Yes." And her stomach just rumbled while she was looking at the onigiri. 

Hearing so, Sena: "Oh, sorry, my bad! Please, uh feel free to eat."

"I will eat." And she picked up one onigiri and took a bite. 

"How about it then?"

"Cannot affertain... uhm purpofe of... queftion..." That was talking while biting. 

"Are they tasty? Did I make them right?"

"With regard to... firft queftion... No. 7, confiderf... 'tafty', to be, accurate... affeffment."

"Oh, r-r-really? That's good to hear!"

"In regard to... fecond, application, of, manual preffure... refulted in, compaction and, higher cohesion. Alfo showing, excess salt level..."

"_Oh..._ **No, wait, that's the best part! Isn't it nice and chewy?**"

After swallowing what in her mouth now, she replied, "Affirmative."

"Huh?"

"No. 7, has not taken sustenance, in this form before. Currently considering that others of Colony 0, may also enjoy the experience."

"_Oh_, you think so?"

"Particularly No. 9, seemed to be growing disaffected with the rations being distributed... And No. 3, whose calorie intake exceeds the baseline, may find, these more sating... As a precaution, salt levels may have to be marginally adjusted, pursuant to guidance from No. 6..."

"Hah..."

And she turned towards Sena, "Hm... Is there a problem?"

"No, no, i-it's nothing. Oh, but... if it's OK with you, could I ask you to tell me more?"

"Acknowledged. Continuing explanation."

---

After finishing the plate, she was back sitting on the bed, with Sena standing beside. "So, were the onigiri tasty?"

"You already have a sufficient reply to this question." Yeah, but she needs more confirmation!!!

"Have you come to like the onigiri I made?" OK, that was the real question. 

"Affirmative."

With great smiles on her face, "Well, that's good then. I'll make them for you again sometime."

"Yes."

In the background, Lanz stated his observation softly, "_Well, she eats like normal, and she can handle small talk._"

Eunie added, "Yeah, there's nothing suspicious about her. _Except she talks funny, but whatever._"

Mio suggested, "Let's let Sena keep her talking for a bit longer."

Back at the spotlight, Sena changed the topic, "Hey, you said you didn't have a name."

"Recollection of making such a statement exists."

And she suggested with great encouragement, "Well, then... What about, 'Segiri'?"

And there was a long pause as she was considering it, "Hmmm...."

"Uh..."

"Perhaps this is some sort of code, or cipher."

"No, I'm just... I was asking what you thought about, 'Segiri', for a name."

"Cannot follow logic behind query. Requesting more rational explanation."

"You're using difficult words again... I just, didn't want to keep **only** calling you 'you'."

"The designation 'No. 7', is..."

And she cut her off, "Right! I just took the 'se-' part from 'seven', a-and tacked on the 'giri' from 'onigiri'. 'Se-giri'!"

"Failure to comprehend basis for utilizing this nomenclature."

"Well, i-it's 'cause... You said you **liked **onigiri, just then... Huh..."

Lanz interrupted, "**Whoa** whoa whoa whoa whoa, Sena... _Don't you think you're taking it a bit far?_"

Eunie: "Yeah, love... Did you lose your brain at the gym or something?"

Even Taion complaint, "I'm sorry, Sena. I don't think I see what you're after here."

"Whoa, when did everyone get so mean? I think it's a great name, 'Segiri'..."

Noah scratched his head in agreement, against the others' opinions, "Y-yeah, I think so too, actually. It seems really, uh, friendly, somehow..."

Mio: "Ahaha! It's not really like **you** to come out with something like this, Sena."

"_R-really...?_ Well, maybe so... But Mimi, I don't think it's right to **call** a person by a number..."

No. 7: "Hmm..."

"Hey, I'm sorry. I let my mouth _run away from me. I understand if you felt hurt by it._"

"Regulations contain no special provisions, on restricting, designation."

"Huh?"

"No. 7 has no authority on which to reject proposed designations, whatever they may be."

"Does that mean we can call you 'Segiri', and you won't mind?"

After thinking for a few second, she replied, "...Affirmative."

Eunie was impressed, teasingly commented, "Well, there you have it then, _affirmative._" The last she tried to sound like Segiri robot-like voice. 

Mio: "Mhmmm... Nicely done, Sena."

"Yeah, thanks uhuh!" Thinking in her head, "_The girl might still be a total mystery, but really, it wouldn't have been right to call her 'number seven'..."

---

The group now gathered closer by Segiri's side. Beep beep sounded in Segiri's iris, and she was alerted, "Hmph!"

"What happened?"

"A coded transmission from Colony 0." She read the message while she explained. Turning to the group, "The Moebius Consul F is requesting parley, with the Ouroboros."

Noah's eyes opened wide, "**The Moebius is requesting what...?!**"

"No. 7, will use, own Iris as relay to forward the transmission to you." And the group received the call thereafter on their respective Irises. 

Moebius F, with a thick snail-shell head, started the conversation, "A pleasure to make your acquaintance, my young Ouroboros friends. I am F, and before we go further, I would like to sincerely apologize for the discourtesy of this method of introduction."

Eunie was disgusted, "Ugh, what a shameless slug. He thinks we'll forget he tried to kill us?"

Taion replied, "You say you want to parley. How do you imagine _that will go, at this point...?_"

"I am certain you will feel guarded, and rightly so. And yet, with that acknowledged, I would like to offer an opening of _negotiations with you._"

Mio: "Negotiations?"

"Should you accept my invitation, I will rescind the extermination order on you Ouroboros. Colony 0 will henceforth no longer concern itself with **your** comings and goings."

Lanz: "**Oh, that'd be swell!**... If we were stupid enough to trust your word."

Noah: "And your demands?"

After a short pause, "... The bodily return of No. 7."

Sena: "Huh?"

Noah: "And that's it? That's all it would take for you to never fight with us again?"

"Yes, you have my guarantee, and that of the whole of Colony 0."

Eunie: "_Are you joking? You're Moebius. You'd **throw** away one or two soldiers without **batting** an eye._"

"Certainly, some Consuls do display such callousness. A **deplorable** state of affairs... But not I. I hold the light of life possessed by Colony 0 to be of the **utmost** importance. _Naturally, that includes No. 7._ That is precisely why I have reached out to you, nominally my enemies, even **with** the concomitant difficulties acknowledged."

Sena looked stern, "Are you telling the truth?"

Lanz: "C'mon Sena, don't fall for it..."

Sena continued, "Can you give us a guarantee that you aren't lying to us right now?"

"**Of course!**... is what I would love to say, but **naturally**, simple words are never enough to engender trust, I know." Then, after sending some data to Segiri, "I have sent the current coordinates of Colony 0 to No. 7. We shall remain here. _Should you find yourselves receptive to my offer_, do **please** pay us a visit, _and bring No. 7 with you._"

Noah: "So you think giving us your location will make us trust you?"

Taion: "How do we know this isn't a trap?"

"In such a circumstance, you would possess a handy _hostage in No. 7. I trust I needn't say more?_"

Lanz: "Ugh... **Had this guy heard** the way he sounds?"

F shook his head, "Of course, that is not what any of us really want. My desire is to see No. 7 _safely returned to me. That is all._" Then he called out, "No. 7."

"Yes."

"I am tasking you with guiding them to Colony 0. Follow their command until your return."

"Compliance."

"And... No. 7?"

"Yes."

"_We've all been worried about you._"

"Hmmm..."

"That will be all. I will eagerly anticipate the day when we meet in more favorable circumstances." And he ended the call. 

And Segiri stood up to explain herself, "By the Consul's authority, No. 7 is hereby assigned to the Ouroboros' command, as an exceptional measure for the duration. Pending your decision on the outcome of the proposed exchange, I await your command to depart."

Noah scratched his head, "_Well this was... unexpected._"

Sena asked, "Segiri... _What do we do with you...?_"

---

Still gathering around Segiri in the room, Lanz questioned, "Wait, are you serious? You really trust that Consul?"

Sena: "Of course I don't, not entirely. I know it could be a trap, as well. But still... If... And this is a big 'if', OK? If he was telling the truth earlier, then we won't have to fight with Segiri and her friends... And more importantly, I'm sure there are people waiting for her there... So, for all those reasons, I thought..."

Noah crossed his arms, "Well, either way, things can't stay like this forever."

Taion hypothesized, "Rather than make speculation after speculation and do nothing, you want to set something in motion."

Mio: "It's also possible, if unlikely, _that we **might** be able to talk it through..._"

Noah, turning to Segiri, "All right. Can you tell us where Colony 0 is right now?"

"Aetia region, Captocorn Peak."

"Huh? Wait, isn't that...?"

Eunie finished her sentence, "That's where we fought against those guys, ain't it?"

"The point where Colony 0 is stationed is located even further in."

Lanz: "THat explains why you were lying in wait for us there."

"However, the geographical feature, called the 'Nocclia Mire', is located, en route. Entering it, is predicted to have severe negative impact, on your biological processes."

"Then how do you guys get through?" Mio asked. 

"A Ferron's environmental hazard resistance can temporarily neutralize poisonous materials."

Sena questioned, "What's a 'Ferron'...? Oh, is that the thing you were riding inside?"

"Affirmative. Consequently, traversal through the afflicted area, will necessitate retrieval and refurbishing, of the abandoned Ferron suit."

Noah suggested, "We can ask Riku to fix it up. Will that be OK with you?"

"No objections."

Scratching his head, "Ohhh, if Riku must. Will not leave friends in lurch."

Sena: "All right then. Just be patient for us a little while longer, OK, Segiri?"

"Compliance."

---

Back at where the levnis was abandoned, with Segiri following them, they found the broken Ferron. Riku was examining the status while Noah asked, "How does it look, Riku? Can you get it in working order?"

"It look like problem mostly cosmetic. Riku have it working in no time flat."

---

After fixing it, "Annnnddd ready. Riku proud of own handiwork."

Sena: "And how does it look to you? Can you still use it?"

Already climbed into her Ferron, she reported the stats, "Power lines clear. All sensors online... Ferron unit No. 7, fully operational."

Sena: "That... sounds good? A-are you ready to guide us?" Nope, don't understand all the checks and technical stuff, but let's continue. 

"Understood. Designating route."

---

They found Consul F at the colony location. There were other levnises and Ferrons parked around the edge of the open-ended cavern. Open-ended means the cavern opened itself to the sky, with a cliff at the edge, and they could look out to other mountains from the inside. F: "Welcome, friends. I have been hoping you would come."

Noah: "We've brought your soldier, as you asked. So what now?"

He turned to Segiri, whom climbed out of her Ferron and stood beside Sena, examined her from afar, "Hmm... No. 7 seems uninjured. Thank you for this magnanimous measure. As promised, Colony 0's order to eradicate Ouroboros will be rescinded. You have my word, that we will never again darken your doorsteps, figuratively speaking."

Eunie didn't believed a word, "Hah. Talk is cheap, man."

"Oh I assure you, the soldiers of Colony 0 are most faithful. They would **never** disobey, an issued order. What's more, I personally have nothing but the deepest respect for you all. After all, you did tend to my dear No. 7, and brought her back to me, **unscathed**... I offer you my sincere, _heartfelt thanks._"

Lanz: "Yeeeahh, all right..."

Eunie, arms folded, shook her head, "_This, doesn't sit right with me._"

"Oh I have just had the greatest idea. No. 7, you and our guests have traveled long and far to arrive here. Why don't we introduce them to the rest of the Colony 0 personnel?"

"Complaince."

Noah was feeling not, "Uh, **I think we're actually fine...**"

The Consul shook his head, "Nonsense, no need to be shy. We need to tie a bond of trust between us, and where better to start than with a round of introductions?"

Sena asked, "Segiri, are you all right with that?"

"The Consul's word is absolute. No. 7, does not have the prerogative of choice."

"No. 7, show your face to everyone. I'm sure they'd like that. No. 4 has also been worried about you."

"...Yes."

Sena: "No. 4?"

The Consul explained, "No. 4 is No. 7's right-hand man. _With No. 7 absent,_ he had to take over the _reins instead._"

Eunie got it, "He means like being an aide, then?"

Sena caught the important terms, "Segiri, does that make you the commander?"

"Parts of the definition appear discrepant, but on the whole, there are no major issues with that denomination."

"You could've told us, you know..."

"I have no record, of the fact being queried."

Noah's eyes peered over his shoulder to the right, where Taion stood, silently commented, "_You've noticed it too, right, Taion?_"

"Yeah, and I can't make sense of it. The Consul's attitude is one thing, _but more importantly..._"

Skimming the cave, Noah continued, "_The Ferronis. The one thing a colony needs, and there's no sign of it here. Or maybe... Maybe it's just something completely different from the colonies we know?_"

Taion shook his head, unable to ascertain, "A special unit under direct Moebius command... Were we too hasty, coming here?"

Sena turned to Sena and Segiri, whom were still chatting, "_For Sena's sake, and for that girl she trusts, let's hope not._"

---

In the Colony, Segiri met with No. 4, a young boy wearing the swimsuit-like costume too, pointed chin, large eyes, and boy-like hair (???), spoke, "No. 7... I'm relieved to see you back safe."

She immediately get back to her work status, "No. 4. No status abnormalities?"

"We're all good here. No. 10 and No. 8 are currently on a mission, but should be back soon."

Segiri thought for a while, seeing that he had misunderstood her. "Revising query. Are there status abnormalities in No. 4's condition?"

"A-a-ah, no, I'm OK. No. 4 can still fight." He really thought deep about it as he felt himself. 

"However..."

"No. 7, you're not at fault. If anything, i-it's my fault, having such poor abilities in battle. Without disengaging the Ferron's limiter, I-I couldn't fight properl- Urgggh..." And he just started falling. We noticed there was also the collar on his neck, but because she don't have the long-hair like Segiri's, we can see it was a backbone-like structure attached to his backbone.

After he lose consciousness, Segiri immediately got in front and held him from falling, "Huuuuhhh, No. 4!"

Lanz was concerned, "Wh-what's wrong? What is it?" And red motes started floating off his body. 

Eunie: "Sparks, you don't think this is..."

Mio: "His flame's leaking...!"

No. 4 still had his conscious, knell on the floor as Segiri followed him down, "Hrrrrrr... I'm cold... No. 7... Where are... I can't see... a thing..." After a while, his flames stopped leaking. Segiri put him down on the floor. While he hadn't turned into a husk, his eyes were bland and lifeless, unconscious.

"Huuuuorrrrrr..."

Sena, in a hushed tone, "**Segiri! What just happened?!**"

F was the one explaining, "No. 4 has given his life to the Ferron."

Lanz: "_Oi, you'd better explain yourself._"

He turned to the Ferron, explained, "The Ferrons are powered by life's flames. The Flame Clocks that impel them are synchronized to _those of their passengers._"

Taion was thinking when he heard the key term, "Wait, did you say Flame Clocks? Does that make the Ferrons...?"

He knew what he's asking about, nodded, "Indeed. The design differs, but you could see them as functionally identical to Ferronises. In addition, Ferron Flame Clocks are fitted with the function to disengage the limiters."

Noah squinted, "'Disengage the limiters'...?"

"Doing so allows the Ferron to burn through the flames that fuel it at an accelerated rate, maximizing the unit's power output. Once the limiter is disengaged, a first-term soldier can perform at a level comparable to a colony's commander... That incandescent power is the **pith**, and marrow of the **Ferron's, of Colony 0's might.**" And his tone got excited. 

Taion prompted for more, "But what _is_ Colony 0, to begin with? Who are you, who are its soldiers?"

"You could say we are those who work behind the scenes of this war. Battlefield manipulation, inciting sedition, information control, elimination of third party forces... It's all due to our **ceaseless, thankless efforts** that this war can continue unabated, and each life's fate arrives, as ordained... In other words, we **maintain** the fabric of the world. **That, is the duty which is our pleasure to fulfill.**"

Taion wasn't convinced. "Nothing but empty words. **That's the** reason you put your men in those things?!"

Eunie: "Well mate, you just showed us your whole arse. I knew _you didn't care about the lives of your soldiers after all!_"

"**Preposterous! I treasure their lives above any other good! They are, to me, the most exalted substance!** Their immaculate lives, **sacrificed in service to the world**, permeate it, and form the basis of the eternity **WE MOEBIUS COVET...!**"

Sena had been controlling to not explode, closing her eyes all along, "_Stop it._"

He hadn't heard her, continued his explanation, "Protecting my innocent lambs whose souls **lubricate the gears of the world, through a sublime sacrifice -- that, is the HIGHEST CALLING!!! Isn't it the loftiest vocation conceivable? Surely you must agree-**"

"**SHUT UP ALREADY!!!**"

He was flabbergasted, "Ah I must beg your pardon. Have I said something to incur your displeasure?"

"**Snuff all of that, and snuff you! How dare you... How could someone like you think for a SECOND you treasure Segiri! You have no right! We'll bring you down, right here and now... Segiri and everyone will be FREE from the Flame Clocks!**"

He didn't understood, can't fathomed, "But what in the blazes has brought this on? I told you from the start, I had no intention of fighting you..."

Lanz: "**HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MIND?!!!**"

He closed his eyes for a moment thought, and looked up, made up his mind, "_Well, it seems unavoidable, now._ It seems the negotiations have broken down. Truly regrettable, and yet perhaps, inevitable..."
