# What Remains

## Variant A:
(This is when you collect Vandham's dog tag in Chapter 1, without the Agnian party.)

(One is unsure when this event happened. It may be in the past, perhaps during their second return before Mio's team arrived. Eunie's wearing her kevesi battlesuit)

One morning.

Eunie, wearing her kevesi battle suit, walked up towards where Guernica's shirt was, knelt down and check a triangular dog tag handing on his shirt. "Are these his dog tags?" 

Noah, Lanz, and Riku followed behind. Noah knelt to her left. Lanz stood to his left. Noah read out, "Guernica... Vandham... I guess that's his name." 

"That's great..." 

"Huh?" Noah didn't know what Eunie meant by that. 

"I kinda hated the idea of not even knowing who he was." 

Noah: "...Right, yeah." He nodded, "Let's remember him... as the man who gave us a goal, and the ability to choose." 

"Yeah..."
