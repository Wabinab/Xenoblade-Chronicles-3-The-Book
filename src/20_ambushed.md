# Ambushed

Continuing their journey on a flat surface, the surrounding barren; a slope located behind them, and some tunnels in their direction of travel. Halfway through, soldiers wearing Agnian armor fired some blasts that draws a purple tail as they flew. Hitting the ground in front of the group, it blasted, purple smoke released, blocking their view of the tunnel. 

Defensively posed, more shots fired on to behind them, cutting their retreat route. Lanz gasped, "What the-... smokescreen?!"

Riku took a few breath, then covered his nose as he warned: "It smell weird! This... not just normal smoke!{{footnote: The translator think this is Riku, but the word 'smoke' seemed like Taion's voice.}}"

Taion, standing to his 5 o'clock, immediately covered his nose as he warned. The others quickly followed, backs facing each other in a circle. Soldiers with twin blades moved, their visor dragged a red trail as (s)he moved towards Noah. 

Noah managed to react in time, swords bashing together as he sliced back. The soldier was quick to respond, retreated before (s)he suffered any injury, and vanished into the smoke. "They're hiding in the smoke!" The others withdrew their weapons.{{footnote: Which means, they no longer block their nose!}}

Mio's sharp ears counted the footsteps, then warned, "More incoming!"

An Agnian was driving towards Eunie. Mio, standing to her right, heard its arrival and moved to block for her. Yet, she felt a weakness and numbness, "Huh? My legs?!"

Her attention turned to her faltering legs, the soldier took the chance to slash just as her attention retargeted, sending her on to the ground. "Ahhhh!"

"Mimi!" Sena's hammer landed empty, though managed to prevent him/her from taking advanced actions. While she helped her up, (two) soldiers carrying guns appeared from their front, fired more somnolent gas at the group. 

Lanz ran and blocked for Mio and Sena, warned "This smoke... Don't breathe it in!" Sticking his broadsword into the ground, he withdrew the hidden machine gun and fired at the gunned soldiers. Their agile movement dodged his bullets as they retrieved behind the smoke. Perhaps unaware, or perhaps believed in his teammates, he didn't turn to face a twin-blade soldier approaching from behind. 

"Who the spark are they?!" Eunie had his back. 

Manana replied, her wok 'shield' carried in front of her, "Soldiers from Agnus, duh!" 

Taion deflected a soldier with his Mondo, commented, "I... I know this maneuver...!" 

"What is it?" Noah, to the right of him, prompted for more. 

"One of Colony 13's little specialties." That brought him back to the past memories, how Lambda's soldiers were slaughtered by the Kevesi without mercy. 

Lanz, still firing his guns, "So, you've seen this before? But... wait a mo, these mudders are Agnian!" 

"I don't get it... Why this specific tactic...?" His mondo made a barrier in front of him, giving him the time to think and hypothesized, "Could it be... the commander...?!" 

Even without soldiers attacking them, the soldiers whom initially fired the shots, standing at a higher platform to both side of their route, continued firing more smoke, making it thicker. 

Eunie now laid her back on Taion, "This is looking grim... There's no way to tell where they're gonna come from next!" 

"Urgggg..." Recalling how they had handled it from before, he commented, "Water."

"Water?" Eunie wasn't sure what he's talking about. 

"Yeah. There are water veins in these caves. We can use them to make an escape." 

"You sayin' make a dash for it?" 

"Errrr...." Taion's eye scanned the vicinity as he continued to analyze the situation, to take in more information. Red trail were encircling them while others waited for him. 

Lanz, still firing his gun at a single direction, urged, "Taion, decide! Look, I trust your judgment!"

"You do...?" His fist clenched, had no choice but nodded, then shouted to the group,  "All right... We'll have to run. I judge it to be the best option right now!" 

"All I needed to hear. Let's move! Lead the way!" Lanz was relieved, sheathing his machine gun as he had his back. 

"I'm on it." He make for a run, the others followed, two by two.

They arrived before the gushing river, cleared of anesthetic smoke. There was some roof structure behind them, and he stood where he and Nimue stood before, on the wooden (or maybe metallic) platform facing the river. "This is it!"

All except Eunie walked up to assess the river, Eunie on the lookout. Except for some metal beams to her 10 o'clock, above the slope in front of Eunie, purple smoke were quick to spread towards their direction. 

While Noah was making further analysis, or to ask his gut, Eunie called out, "They're here! Can't see 'em, but it's a real welcome party."

No more time to think. He looked towards Mio, whom nodded back at him. The final decision had been made, "Time to go! Big breath, then jump!" He took the lead and plunged head first into the stream.

The group were running from rocky ground towards grassy, leafy, flowery, ground. A tree, beside a cylindrical rock, the base of a waterfall in the distant, the evaporating water vapor/mist enshrouded our view of what's behind. 

Just as they dashed past the tree, Noah, on the lead, stopped on his track, and others were quick to follow. The ground shook, loud noise from where they were facing, which is actually a base of another waterfall. Defensively, they watched as a pike with an Agnian Flame Clock, half-filled, emerged from behind. It was so huge its torso temporarily cut the whole width of the waterfall from reaching where it normally reach. Fully emerged, it drove and landed in front of the group, shadowing them from the sunlight with its Flame Clock. With waters still dripping, it extended both its legs and landed on the edge of the island before them, sending dirt splashing up, and it "turned on" its eyes. 

From below it, levnises of various types (the ball bearing type with two swords on its hand which we saw during the Guernica mission, and the four-armed autonomous levnis they fought back at the Colony 18's battlefield) surrounded them. 

Isurd, his right iris blood red, walked out of the ferronis on the higher platform (a platform higher than the horn above the Flame Clock). 

Taion's eyes gleamed, "I knew it... Commander Isurd!" 

Isurd sneeringly shouted back, "Long time no see, _Taion_!" 

"That guy..." Eunie recognized him from Taion's past memories. 

"So they got to you too. Commander!" Taion shouted back. "Did they order you to destroy Ouroboros too?" Soldiers now joined the levnises, encircling them.

Isurd replied, "Not... exactly." 

"Huh?"

"You must've worked it out. This strategy... mirrors that day. When Nimue's life... was cut short!" His voice, sharp and vicious, struck at Taion's emotional chord. 

Taion's iris widened. The commander, joyful his tactic worked out, continued, "I figured you would try to use that route to flee. That's how I knew to wait right here. And so I replicated the conditions of that day to a tee." 

Taion took a step backward, questioned, "But why do such thing?!" 

Starting with a calm tone, then undulating, lively, "Why? Well, let's see... In a nutshell... To remind you- of your past! To make you relive it, and drive you to despair! To break your heart! To steal all that you hold dear!" Clenching his fist tempestuously in front of him, "To ruin you to your very core! Wahahahahahahahah!"  

"That is my revenge! It's payback for Nimue dying with her wish unfulfilled! It's your own past! Its finally caught up with you!" He pugnaciously sneered at him. 

There was a moment of silence, and Taion seemed stoical. A moment later, the stone weighted too deep in his heart. He closed his eyes, looked down, and his breathe betrayed him, recalling his conversation with Isurd after the mission. 

#### (Start of Taion's memories)

In the dimly-lit commander's tent, young Taion spoke _something_{{footnote: We couldn't hear what this something is.}} to the commander. Isurd listened attentively, gently nodded as he finished. Then, Taion looked down to his 11 o'clock in agony. Isurd took two steps forward, put his hand on his shoulder. Perhaps distracted, he brought out Nimue's stopwatch gadget from his pocket, held it on his palm, glancing at it. 

Isurd took his hands off him, calmly asked, "Nimue gave it to you, right? You should hold on to it."

With a tone trying to hold back his tears, "It was... my fault... My pride led to her death. If only I'd presented a less reckless plan... The strategist would never have... Nimue would..." He gripped on to the gadget forcefully. 

As tears aggregated, he held out the gadget straight at the commander, not daring to look at him as he wept. Whimperingly, "It- It's too much for me..." Then, he put his hands down{{footnote: Translator couldn't see whether he gave it to him or not.}} "I don't... I don't deserve this..." As he spoke, he took steps backward, and leave thereafter. 

Isurd right palm held upwards{{footnote: Again, one couldn't see whether there is any gadget on his hand or not}}, looking at him leaving, didn't say a thing nor tried retaining him. 

#### (End of Taion's memories)

The smiling, red-iris Isurd looked down on Taion, watching him grieved his past loss. 

"It's true... It is my fault..." His fingers slowly and tremblingly clenched into a grip, "You were the kindest man I knew, Commander..." Then, raised his tone two octaves, "But I made you use the same enemy tactic that cost Nimue her life..." He looked up at him, "I drove you to such desperation, and now... you're determined to kill me..."

Calmly spoken, "Precisely right, Taion." As he finished, he turned to re-enter the torso of the Ferronis. Before he entered the door, he looked to his side, "The past..." then turn to him, in a vicious tone, "has come back to haunt you!" Then turned and walked in.
