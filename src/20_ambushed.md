# Ambushed
(Purple gas -- somnolent, anesthetic)
=== 

The group just walked down a surface, slowly pushing themselves forward on the monotonous surroundings. As they were approaching some tunnels ahead, soldiers, seemingly of Agnian origins, fired some blasts from both sides of the path they were walking to the front of their road. As it made contact, purple smoke blasted, blocking the forward entrance. They got into a defensive stance, but more shots were fired behind them, purple smoke now enclosed all their directions. 

Lanz: "What the-... smokescreen?!"

Riku covered his nose: "It smell weird!"

Taion, realized something, covered his nose too, "This not just normal smoke!" The others quickly followed him, their backs facing each other so they could shield in all directions. We could see soldiers, their eyes dragging red lights as they moved, holding Agnian twin blades, towards the team. 

Noah managed to see it coming, shielded from its ambush before it hits him. He sliced at the soldier, which retreated and vanished in the smoke. He called out to others as they drew their weapons, "They're hiding in the smoke!" They could no longer blocked their nose holding their weapons.

Mio, with her sharp ears, heard more footsteps, warned the group, "More incoming!" 

One Agnian soldier was targeting Eunie. Mio heard it coming before she noticed, blocking in front of her. Suddenly, she felt a weakness, numbness, "Huh? My legs?!" 

The soldier approached her as her attention faltered, sending her onto the ground. 

"Mimi!" Sena bashed landed empty, but managed to prevent him/her from advancing towards Mio. As she helped her up, more soldiers wearing special helmet fired shots at the group. 

Lanz ran in front of Mio and Sena, warned, "This smoke... Don't breathe it in!" He called his machine gun and fired at those whom shot the smoke, unaware of the twin blades approaching from behind him. 

"Who the spark are they?!" Eunie had his back. 

Manana seemed to notice, her shield drawn out, "Soldiers from Agnus, duh!" 

Taion, as he pushed soldiers back with his Mondo, commented, "I... I know this maneuver...!" 

"What is it?" Noah asked. 

"One of Colony 13's little specialties." That brought him back to the past memories, how Lambda's soldiers were slaughtered without mercy. 

Lanz, still firing his guns, "So, you've seen this before? But wait a mo, these mudders are Agnian!" 

Taion didn't understand either, shielding a smoke blasted at him with his Mondo, their edges glowing bright yellow, as he replied, "I don't get it... Why this specific tactic...?" as he hypothesized, "Could it be... the commander...?!" 

There was no time to think. Soldiers high above continued to fire poison smoke at the team. 

Eunie, her backs on Taion, "This is looking grim... There's no way to tell where they're gonna come from next!" 

Taion, remembered how they solved the problem, replied, "Water."

"Water?" Eunie didn't understand. 

"Yeah. There are water veins in these caves. We can use them to make an escape." 

"You sayin' make a dash for it?" 

Taion was still having difficulty analyzing the situation, seeing soldiers eyes running around in circles, as Lanz, still firing his guns, urged, "Taion, decide! Look, I trust your judgment!" 

"You do...?" Clenching his fist, he had no choice, shouted to the group, "All right... We'll have to run. I judge it to be the best option right now!" 

Lanz agreed, "All I needed to hear. Let's move! Lead the way!" He sheathed his machine gun back to broadsword. 

"I'm on it." He make for a run, while the others followed, one by one.

After they got outside the smoke's vicinity, below some bridges or roof structure, they were back at where Nimue had lead him when he was younger. Standing on the wooden platform, the gushing river in front of them, "This is it!" Purple smoke were behind them, quickly making for their direction. Eunie was watching out while some others analyzed the stream. 

Eunie called out, "They're here! Can't see 'em, but it's a real welcome party."

Noah looked towards Mio, whom nodded back to him. He made the final decision, "Time to go! Big breath, then jump!" He was the first in.

(After they got out of the stream from the exit)

They were running on rocky grounds towards grassy grounds. There was a tree to their left, and further, mist created by water falling on the lake surface enshrouded the distant area. 

Noah stopped as the ground below them shook. There was also a waterfall in front of them. A ferronis, Flame Clock half filled, drove out from behind the waterfall, temporarily cutting the flow as water smashed on the ferronis's hulk. Fully emerged, it pointed itself at the group. Then, it extended its (two) legs and landed on the ground before them, sending dirt spashing upwards, and it "turned on" its eyes. 

It wasn't alone. Levnises emerged from below its torso, either the ones floated on ball bearings with two swords, or the four arms two legs floating levnises they fought at the old battlefield previously. They were surrounded. 

Isurd, his right iris blood red, walked out of the ferronis on the higher platform. 

Taion's eyes gleamed, "I knew it... Commander Isurd!" 

Isurd shouted back, sneeringly, "Long time no see, Taion!" 

Eunie: "That guy..." She remember seeing him in Taion's past memories when they combined into Ouroboros. 

"So they got to you too. Commander!" Taion shouted back. "Did they order you to destroy Ouroboros too?" Soldiers now joined the levnises, encircling them. 

Isurd replied, "Not... exactly." 

"Huh?"

"You must've worked it out. This strategy... mirrors that day. When Nimue's life... was cut short!" His voice, sharp but clear, struck at Taion's emotional well being. 

Taion, upon hearing, his iris widened. The commander continued, "I figured you would try to use that route to flee. That's how I knew to wait right here. And so I replicated the conditions of that day to a tee." 

Taion took a step backward, questioned, "But why do such thing?!" 

"Why? Well, let's see... In a nutshell... To remind you- of your past! To make you relive it, and drive you to despair! To break your heart! To steal all that you hold dear!" Clenching his fist with tempestuously, "To ruin you to your very core! Wahahahahahahahah!" He spoke with an undulating tone. 

Looking back down, "That is my revenge! It's payback for Nimue dying with her wish unfulfilled! It's your own past! Its finally caught up with you!" 

Taion seemed not to react to his speech like Eunie, but his breath betrayed him, as he recalled.
