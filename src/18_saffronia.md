# Getting Old, Saffronia, Eunie's Recall

> **Writer's note on environment:** By a lakeside, some gray{{footnote: Seen only in daylight scene, second video}} krabble gathered by the barren rocky side of the bank. On the opposite grassy side, there were some platforms arranged in steps. A cyan-white long snake-like dragon slithered through the air. In the distance, we could see mountains and even higher platforms, trees grew more plentifully. Another scene, icy-top mountains lay in the background. We could see some lake/river below the camera, some red-mane wolves occupied and resting on an elevated platform adjacent to the bank. A single tree full of red leaves stood out in the distance. Trees are more broad like Africa's Yellowwood (a tall bark without any branches except at the very top) rather than purely pine, though both existed. Yet another scene, by a river. An animal with a light attached to its head, like a lantern, strodding beside a river. We could also see some rhinoceros-like animals, armu, grazing in the meadow on the same side of the bank. At the edge of the river, there were deserts occupied trees with leaves arranged in a fan-shape, and something that looked like a Kevesi ferronis or ruins, half covered, to the left of the desert. This, is **Rae-Bel Tableland**, of Fornis Region. 

---

As the group tramped on the grass fields near a gushing river, they saw some of the armu grazing in the distance. The red-leaf tree was seen far away, at the other side of the river. The group paused their steps, as Noah and Mio stopped side by side, Taion and the others was somewhere further away from them, chatting. 

Noah examined the armu group, commented, "That's funny. I'd never noticed that before..."

Mio questioned, "Oh, do they... not have Armus where you're from?"

"Yeah... I meant 'getting old'. Is that what that is?" There was a baby armu on the left, grazing. A larger armu in the middle, its back grew a hardened skin, armor-like, with short horns, also grazing. The oldest stood to the right, fully grown horns and head plates and back plates, rough leg skins, _also_ grazing. 

They were reminded by the wrinkles on Guernica. "_It's called getting old, this._"

Noah continued, "That smaller Armu over there. It starts little, but grows over time. Becomes like the bigger one. All the creatures do it... But we never change that much.{{footnote: 10 years old to 20 years old doesn't change much? BTW, 10 years old is just one's estimate, it may be 12 years old to 22 years old, one don't know.}}"

Mio's eyebrows raised up, "Huh..."

"It's such a basic fact. So why haven't we realized it before...?" She turned to look at him, before turning back and enjoy the view of the armus. 

This scene was watched in the projector room by the moebius, particularly, the moebius with the X on his chest, wearing a mask rather than a helmet. The golden mask covered half of his face above his nose. As if replying to Noah, "Realization leads to hope... Which in due time turns to despair. The significance of the stasis, is driven ever deeper within... " 

A moebius that looked like a bird nose pointed downwards, like a medieval Roman Armor head plate, commented, "A moment in time. A sublime experience. That brilliance, it shines ascendant over all else."

A female moebius with a butterfly mask over her eyes, wearing a helmet, "That's why it takes so much frickin' work. Working stinks..."

Z, with purple dendrites-like shape stretching from the tip of his lips, white hair, red iris "They all learn sooner or later. They learn how priceless it was, how grossly irreplaceable. The 'Eclipse'{{footnote: Homecoming events were done during the Eclipse.}} grows near..." The moebius sign appeared on his right iris, triggering the moebius sign on the other moebius' (both) irises, except for the golden mask X guy, with only his right iris glowing. The projector focused on Mio's term symbol. 

Back to the scene,  Mio's term symbol only had the center dot remaining{{footnote: As we mentioned before.}}. Mio spoke out, "They get along nice... Must be good friends."

Noah: "It's funny. Just looking at these guys... It puts your mind at ease."

"Mhm!" Mio nodded, agreed. 

Noah asked, "Is it... an effect of becoming Ouroboros?"

"Good question. Still, I think I could... get used to this." She thought for a while, their situations irrevocable. 

Noah nodded, "Yeah... Me too."{{footnote: It wasn't sure if they means the same 'this', Noah probably means getting old, but one thinks Mio not. One could also consider 'this' being the situation they're in, the life they lived.}}

---

As the group tramped down the grassy surface to the left of the red-leaves tree, whom grew with its bark by a rocky platform. Taion, penultimate on the line, stopped and glanced at it. Others in front didn't notice his absence. Noah stopped after he surpassed him, seeing he didn't follow up. 

Taion took step towards the red-leaves tree, Noah following behind. The evening sun caressed the leaves, glittered as it reflected off its surface. 

"Did you find something?" Noah sounded from behind. 

"Hm? No..." Surprised that someone followed him, he spoke in a low tone, "Just brings me back a bit... It reminded me of someone."

"Oh yeah?" Noah was eager to know.

#### (Start of Taion's Memories)

Young Taion, inside an Agnian camp with Nimue, looking at a picture with pitch dark walls of unknown material. Red leaves covered quite a lot of its surface. At the very end (or the very top){{footnote: Author couldn't recognize the perspective of the picture.}}, a hole with blue sky and white clouds. He asked Nimue, "What is this?"

"A **Saffronia**." Nimue sounded from in front. 

"I know that. But, I've never seen one in such full bloom before." 

"Heh. It's special." 

"Huh... So, why give this to me?" 

"It's a treasure of mine." She glanced away, reminisced nostalgically, "I'd like to go back someday. To where this was taken... It's a dream I have..."

As Taion looked at her reaction, glancing back at the photo, she brought out her stopwatch gadget. Nimue opened it up to look at it, "Not that I have all that much time to spare." Her term symbol, on her left arm, showed the central dot and half of the central diamond red. She grabbed it into her fist and putting it to her chest, lowering her head and closing her eyes, as if to bring her back where she wanted to go in the moment, "But soon..."

Taion watched her reactions in silence. 

#### (End of Taion's Memories)

He sighed, "She was the one who taught me strategy... Who taught me how to fight using the Mondo." The Mondo appeared in front of him, danced in front of him before floating sideway out of the scene. They glanced at it as Taion spoke.

"Sorry..." Perhaps he apologized for having someone to share his worries. 

To which Noah replied, "Not to worry..." 

"But why...? Why did she show me that picture...?" He looked down, still curious, perhaps with some regret. 

Walking in front of him, Noah, glancing at the Saffronia, suggested, "I suppose she wanted to share it with you. The memory."

"Is that... why she..." 

"You know... It's not unheard of."

"Huh?" He wasn't sure what he meant. 

He turned, tap Taion's right shoulder lightly as he walked off towards where the group was, Taion followed with his sight. Only he had the answers to his own questions. The ground below the Saffronia bloomed with orange flowers, traced its path towards the dirt road in the distance. The front group _still_ hadn't notice the two guys missing far behind. Turning and taking a final look at the Saffronia, he followed thereafter. 

---

Someone watched the group traversed from his/her iris. It was Isurd, inside an Agnian camp, perhaps in Colony Lambda's headquarters. 

"These soldiers... Taion?!" He turned off his iris, turning his attention to the joker helmet consul, asked, "These are your targets... sir?"

The joker face bounced side to side as he walked, closing their distance, and put his hands behind his necks, looking up at Isurd (since his head as in line with Isurd's lower torso) "Yep. You'll handle it, right?"

"And it's... because they're consorting with enemy soldiers? If that's so, shouldn't we question them first?"

The consul, putting his hands down, sighed, "Ugh, you're a hell of a stickler, aren't you? I _could_ just go and do it the K way..." The moebius sign glowed in his right iris. Both of Isurd's cornea lose its light, left iris glowed in red like that of Ethel previously. 

That was just a while before he gave up, the moebius symbol lose its light. "Ugh... forget it." He turned to his back and walked some distance, as Isurd came back to life. "There's just no zest. This time, I'm gonna take a different angle." 

Isurd, unsure of what had happened, spoke out, "C-Consul...?"

The consul turned to face Isurd, "Heh. Let's do this, Isurd." He squatted, hands hugging himself, as if a ball of energy was suppressed within. Dark energy released to its surrounding shook the floor. Isurd, confounded, backed up into a defensive posture. 

"Go on, spill it for me... Gimme all you're feeling, deep inside!" As he finished, he opened his arms, as if to embrace, the ball of energy shone so bright that Isurd had to block his face to prevent blinded by it. The bright light engulfed the whole tent.

Approaching an old battlefield. Ruins laid on the barren sooty ground, itself surrounded by higher platforms. Wind blew hard on the surface of the battlefield. Icy mountains could be seen beyond the distance. Kevesi corpses, levnises shards, filled all over the place. The atmosphere was foreboding. Noah commented as they stopped, "This is awful..."

Mio, to his 4 o'clock, added, "It doesn't look recent. Been here a while. And the battle, it must've been massive." Some fragments, seemingly ferronis shards, rusty and half buried in the ground. 

Taion: "It's not just infantry. I see Ferronis wreckage strewn all over." 

Lanz thought forward, "There could be stuff here we can reuse. We should look."

To which Noah agreed, "Yeah, good idea. Let's split up and have a look around." They split individually in different directions. 

Disagreeing with Lanz after she left, Eunie strodded as she scanned her vicinity, levnises wreckages beside where she walked "'Stuff we can reuse', my wings... All this junk is rusted through..."

"Huh?" Something shiny and looking new on the ground caught her attention. She squatted to pick it up. It was a circular object. As she stood back up, sighed with disappointment, "Ugh, no love. The connector's the wrong size..." She threw it on the floor, turning her attention elsewhere. 

Somewhere in the distance where she threw it caught her attention. Beside some ferronis and levnis wreckages, a silhouette figure seemingly down on the floor{{footnote: Bent down? Knelt down? Sat down? One don't know.}}. She approached the figurine, whom had a neck-long hair, with wings like that of Eunie. "This one's Kevesi... You've been here for... quite a while..."

She bent down, looking at a dog tag attached to its shirt. She removed it onto her hands, scanned it with her iris to decipher it: 
> Name: Eunie\
> Affiliation: Colony 18\
> Class: Sharpshooter

She was confounded. Her iris constricted as she questioned herself, emotionally unstable, "Wha-what is this-?! Wh-why is my name on here?!" As if taken back by some unbeknownst memories...

#### (Start of Eunie's Recall{{footnote: A recall is a piece of memory from before your current reincarnation.}})

Kevesi soldiers, holding their weapons, marched through the battlefield, their ferronis following behind. A moebius high up in the air released its shots like feathers shooting in all directions, blasting the floor inches by inches, soldiers laid down as dirt enshrouded the air. Struggling to stand up between levnises ruins, flames burning, the triangular head moebius stared at her with its leopard-like sharp purple eyes, showing her its sharp canines. Trembling in agony, she effetely watched its glowing fingernails brought closer to her forehead. 

#### (End of Eunie's Recall)

Imagined how you breathed vigorously, woken up by a haunting nightmare. 

"Eunie... Eunie!" At first, she heard a blurry voice calling out for her, on second tone, her brain registered it was Lanz, gasping as her head rebounced. Looking at her back, his hands around his waist, inspectingly asked, "Did you find anything worthwhile?"

"Huh?!" She slightly turned her head, looking to him from the tip of her eyes. She partially tuned in as most of her conscious and unconscious lingered on the recall. 

Lanz repeated, "I said, didja find anything we might be able to salvage?"

Tremblingly, she replied, "N-nope! Nothing at all... Not here."

"Seriously? You were here all frozen, so I figured you must've struck something gold..." He turned and walked away into the distance, didn't prod deeper. Having no one to disturb her, she continued to sort her feelings. Lanz approached a piece of levnis scraps as he turned to her, nudging, "C'mon, help me shift this thing here, wouldja?"

Unconsciously, she stood up, turning to him, "Y-yeah, all right!" As he squatted to find a place where he could lay his hands, Eunie walked to him halfway before stopping, turning back to glance at the figurine, as if trying to see herself mirrored. As the atmosphere became heavier, she turned away to dissuade herself, "Uh-uh... No way that was me." She turned down to look at the dog tag, still holding in her palm, "Just... someone with the same name as me... A coincidence..." Then, she walked towards Lanz, as if nothing had happened. The figurine seemingly glanced in her direction. 

---

Sena and Manana were squatting, doing nothing, as they heard Noah shouting, "Hey! Over here!"

As the group gathered around him, Mio seemingly recognized it: "Uh... it's...A golden Flame Clock... But wrecked. I've never seen one."

Taion exclaimed, "A real golden Flame Clock."

Lanz: "Ain't that strange? We're talkin' Gold rank -- the shiny pinnacle of every Colony's ambition. And this is how we find it?"

Eunie, seemingly calmed temporarily, crossed her arms, commented as she inspected the clock, "It's, uh... Kevesi, isn't it?"

To which Noah affirmed: "Yeah. Has to be."

Taion looked back at the battlefield behind, "For all that, I'm not seeing any Agnian corpses or weapons. What does it mean?"

Noah didn't understood either, "Sparks... How could they have ended up this way...?"

While they were thinking, the ground shook. The group turned to its core, back facing the Flame Clock, with Eunie complaining, "Aw, come on. Not a-sparkin'-gain?!"

An Agnian levnis with four arms, humanoid structure, and a long pike on its head, drilled its way up, opening up once it floated mid-air, facing the group as it shook away dirt on its body. The group summoned their weapons, prepared for a fight. 

---

(After the battle)

Lanz commented, "What a faff, just one stray Levnis? Barely worth the effort..."

Noah agreed, "Yeah... Doesn't seem to be what did this Colony in."

Taion seemed to have joined some dots, "I see... It was revenge...? Commander, you did it..."

Lanz continued, "So this... works on its own?"

To which Taion replied, "Yes. That's a standard Castle-issue autonomous sentry Levnis. It doesn't need human operators." All non-Nopon turned to face Taion, except for Eunie, whom was still stuck in her thoughts, and Mio, whom walked up to the Levnis, caught by a symbol encarved.

She looked at the symbol engraved on the levnis's plate, asked, "Hey, this symbol... It's Lambda's, right?" She turned to Taion. 

Sena was triggered, turned to him, "Huh? Taion, weren't you with-"

As if something painful triggered his memory. He didn't reply them, instead suggested, "Ahh... We need to get away from here. Though it was unmanned, it's sure to have transmitted its combat data to the Colony. They might even be able to work out we're the ones it was fighting."

Lanz saw the logic, "Right... Well, don't reckon there's anything more of use here. Let's go, Noah."

"Gotcha." He nodded. 

They moved in front of Eunie, her head lowered as she was still caught in her thought, frozen in her place. Noah called out, "Mio?"

"Mm" She nodded, looked at Sena, whom nodded, and followed. 

Taion, the penultimate to leave, turned to find Eunie frozen. She had been holding her wobbling breathe all this time, breathe it out as the group leave. She put her right palm on her left fist, pushing it down as it trembles uncontrollably, perhaps holding the dog tag. "Eunie...?" He watched and called out softly, but didn't disturb her.

===

As the group leaves the battlefield towards the path with grass on both sides, Taion, his eyes on Eunie's low mood, called everyone into attention, "Everybody, listen up."

He continued as everyone faced him, "We've entered Colony Lambda's territory. That means that the probability of our encountering Agnus forces is very high. Before we get any closer to their patrolled zone, we should prepare ourselves by resting." 

Noah turned to Eunie whom was still low on mood, then to Lanz and Mio whom had "no objections here." 

"Or here. Let's go with Taion's plan!" They headed for a lit fireplace just up ahead.
