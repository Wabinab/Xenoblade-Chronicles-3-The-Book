# Getting Old, Saffronia, Eunie's Memory

===

> **WRiter's note on environment:** By a lakeside, some gray krabble gathered by the barren side of the bank, with some platforms on the other side in steps. A cyan-white long snake-like dragon slitered on the air. In the distance, we could see mountains and even higher platforms, trees growing more plentiful in the region. Another scene, giant icy mountains in the background, still beside perhaps yet another lake (or the same lake at a different location), some red-mane wolves rested on an elevated platform further from the bank. A tree, Saffronia, stood out in the distance. Trees are more broad like Africa's (fill in the blank later after Google) rather than purely pine, though both existed. Yet another scene, by a river. Some animals with a light attached to its head, like a lantern, beside a river. We could also see some rhinoceros-like animals grazing in the meadow. Further down where the river flowed, there were deserts occupied by fan-like tree , and something that looked like a Kevesi ferronis or ruins, half covered, to the left of the desert. This, is **Rae-Bel Tableland**, of Fornis Region.

As the group traversed near a gushing river, they saw some of the rhinoceros-like animals, armu, grazing in the distance. The Saffronia was far away. The group paused their steps, particularly, Noah and Mio whom walked side by side, Taion was somewhere further. 

Noah examined the group, commented, "That's funny. I'd never noticed that before..."

Mio questioned, "Oh, do they... not have Armus where you're from?"

"Yeah... I meant 'getting old'. Is that what that is?" There was a baby armu on the left, grazing. A larger armu in the middle, its back had stronger armor-like skin, with short horns, also grazing. The oldest stood to the right, fully grown horns and head plates and back plates, leg skins rough, _also_ grazing. 

They were reminded by the wrinkles on Guernica. "_It's called getting old, this._"

Noah continued, "That smaller Armu over there. It starts little, but grows over time. Becomes like the bigger one. All the creatures do it... But we never change that much.{{footnote: 10 years old to 20 years old doesn't change much? BTW, 10 years old is just one's estimate, it may be 12 years old to 22 years old, one don't know.}}"

Mio's eyes raised up, "Huh..."

"It's such a basic fact. So why haven't we realized it before...?" She turned to look at him, before turning back to enjoy the armus. 

All these was watched in the projector room by the moebius, particularly, the moebius with the X on his chest, wearing a mask rather than a helmet. The golden mask covered half of his face above his nose. He spoke, "Realization leads to hope... Which in due time turns to despair. The significance of the stasis is driven ever deeper within... " 

A moebius that looked like a bird nose pointed downwards, also like an armor, commented, "A moment in time. A sublime experience. That brilliance, it shines ascendant over all else."

A female moebius with a butterfly mask over her eyes, wearing a helmet, "That's why it takes so much frickin' work. Working stinks..."

Z, with purple dendrites-like shape stretching from the tip of his lips, white hair, red iris "They all learn sooner or later. They learn how priceless it was, how grossly irreplaceable. The 'Eclipse'{{footnote: Homecoming events were done during the Eclipse.}} grows near..." The moebius sign appeared on his right iris, and the other moebius had both their iris glowing the moebius sign except for the golden mask X guy, with only his right iris. The projector was focusing on Mio's term symbol. 

Back at the scene, we could see Mio's term symbol only had the center dot left{{footnote: As we mentioned before.}}. Sena and Manana were far left from them, not sure what they were doing. Mio spoke out, "They get along nice... Must be good friends."

Noah: "It's funny. Just looking at these guys... It puts your mind at ease."

"Mhm!" Mio nodded, agreed. 

Noah asked, "Is it... an effect of becoming Ouroboros?"

"Good question. Still, I think I could... get used to this."

"Yeah... Me too."{{footnote: It wasn't sure if they means the same 'this', Noah probably means getting old, but one thinks Mio not. One could also consider 'this' being the situation they're in, the life they lived.}}
