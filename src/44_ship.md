# Building the Ship

Outside the Cloudkeep, the group gathered as Noah called for the request, and Travis answered, "Right, OK... I think I understand. If you're looking for Samon, he'll be in maintenance, same as usual. I'll send someone to get you. Just head on over."

"Many thanks. We'll be outside the Cloudkeep."

---

The ship arrived, they boarded, and it zoomed off into the sky, towards the City. 

---


Upon arrival, they met Mr. Samon at his engineering department and explained the problem to him. "...Ahhh, friends mean old beaut? She tucked away, all cozy in Dock No. 3."

Lanz was surprised, "**WHAT, REALLY?!**"

He nodded, then said, "Curious?"

Noah: "**We are!**"

"Alrighty! Then, please follow Samon to port." 

---

Noah: "So, about this Dock No. 3."

Samon walked towards a small door only Nopons can pass through without crawling: "Ship is culmination of life ambition, so if anything happen, Samon die of heart fracture. That why she hidden sneaky-like." 

After the door opened, the group were shocked. The small door actually turned into a large door: it was concealed as a wall! Sena: "Is that were you're keeping it...?"

"Dock No. 3, right this way, please. Samon take you."

---

There was the new boat, the same color and shape as the previous given to them, but had extra (rocket-like) engines capable of giving it extra boost, capable of tearing through the vortex. The group watched in awe. 

Mio: "So this is it? The ship that can conquer the Great Sea's vortex?"

Lanz: "**Suh-WEEETT{{footnote: 'Sweet' in a whistling tone}}! And you got it all ready, too!**"

Eunie: "It's like a different beast from what we've been using..."

Taion: "I'd venture to call it a masterwork. There's a real sense of power behind this craft."

"Please not to get garments in twist. This is just hull."

All in unison: "**Just the hull?!!!**"

"Key element of engine not quite ready yet. Ship without engine is like... It like Torpedo wrap without filling of Tasty Sausage!"

Manana: "**That crime against cuisine! Torpedo wrap without Tasty Sausage like ship without engine!**"

Sena questioned, "Mr. Samon, what is it the engine needs?"

He brought out something that looked like a needle with a center corkscrew, "To be precise, just need core component." Perhaps that's an activator, the thing that use to light up the piston? "Is this part here, and still need six more to make. Unfortunately, only have this one here."

Mio: "I've seen that metal before... It's the same as Noah's sword, right?"

"Yeah, looks like it."

Samon: "Also, it same as metal that go inside fancy eyepatches of Lost Numbers. Friends know eyepatches block Moebius tracking, surely?"

Lanz: "Yeah, we heard that from Monica."

"That because eyepatch emit special wavelengths. This here show sources of such waves." He transmitted the information to their irises, to display blue dots all across Aionios, "Points of light on map indicate where metal can be located, but Samon could not visit. Every place is fearsome-scary.{{footnote: Fancy how he could track the metal's wavelength but the Moebius can't.}}"

Sena: "Can't you just use the metal from the eyepatches?"

"Those important equipment for Lost Numbers, so no-can-do. And even if could, metal is stretched into thin foil, making total amount not sufficient."

"_That's a shame..._"

Noah: "Mio, look over here..." He focused on a targeted blue dot. It revealed...

"Yeah! The Cloudkeep. It's that thing that the Queen had!"

"Mr. Samon. So if we got you six more, you could complete the ship?"

"Naturally." The confidence he emitted was unwavering. "With that, can make ship with power and defense, that weather any storm or hole in sea."

"How long would it take to build?"

"Would give it three days, tops."

Eunie was amazed, "Wow, that's real snappy."

Taion: "**Good!** As time is of the essence."

Lanz: "**Awww-right. Let's crack on!**"

Noah: "**Yeah!** Mr. Samon. Don't you worry. We'll get you your parts."

"Meh?" What is happening? 

---

As they were leaving, Samon called them back, "**W-wait! Hold Ponios! Samon think Samon deserve some kind of explanation!**" They were leaving him confused. 

Noah: "Ahh, right. Here's the thing..."

After his explanation, "...Now Samon get it. So, friends want to use ship." He turned to looked at his beaut, nodded 2 times, then turned back to the group, "Well then, that only mean one thing!" He took out his computer ball, added, "To make friends' search for core parts easier, Samon must update data from previously."

Eunie don't understand, "How's that?"

"Data derived from obscure source could only show broad-strokes position. But now, Samon will make data more precise. Currently, can only constrain to area of about 2000 square metri. But with bit more elbow grease, should be able to increase accuracy to within 200 metri!"

Lanz can't estimate the scale, but a 10x reduction in area means "That's... good, right? This'll be a walk in the park then!"

"Indeedy-do!"

Taion: "It might take us less time than I'd anticipated."

Mio: "Right!"

Sena: "Mr. Samon, sir, you're sort of our hero right now!"

"So, friends currently have any ideas?"

Noah: "Definitely. We know who has the part in the Aetia region. We should go there now."

"Splendid! Then while friends itinerate, Samon will analyze remaining locations. Will send details when ready. Hope friends excited!"

"Thank you, Mr. Samon."

Mio: "All right then, let's get going."

"Yeah. First stop, the Cloudkeep!" And Samon waved his wings to bade farewell. 

---

Entering the Cloudkeep, the Queen turned around and was surprised at their return. "**Whuh? Why're you here again?**"

---

After the explanation, "**WHAAAAAAATTTTT!!!???**" How befuddled were they that she lost her manners and calmness. "Ah!... A-ahem... The gears of Origin... What fate, that they would be the ones to guide you..."

Noah explained, "Ouroboros and the Sword of the End have. They've brought us this far, so... I wouldn't be surprised."

"I understand. Well in that case, I will gladly concede it." And she took it away from the Ouroboros Stone and put it in Noah's hand. 

Sena thought she was some sentient being, "You knew we'd be coming back though, right? It was all a part of your grand design, yeah? 'The future must be sculpted with one's own hands...' Something like that?" Yeah, God Nia. She looked at Nia, hoping she would agree with her hypothesis... There was a loooong pause. 

"R-right, certainly." A white lie, huh... She wasn't confident herself, but couldn't put her down. "The future isn't something you can just be given. You do have to reach for it, with your own hands. Yes."

Noah took it out from his pocket again after he tucked it in his pocket, "Well, that's the first. Five left to go..."

Taion: "A promising start."

Lanz: "Yeah, could be worse! Keep going like this -- and job done!"

Noah agreed with him, "Thank you, Majesty. I promise you, we won't waste this gift." And they were ready to leave. 

But she wasn't finished, "Wait a moment..." After they faced her, "How will you access Origin, even with the ship?"

"I-I mean..."

Sena excitedly announced, "We're gonna plunge into the Great Sea's vortex..."

"And after that? Origin is protected on every side by thick armor plating. You think you'll find a berth?"

Mio: "I guess, uh... maybe?"

Taion: "For starters, we don't even know Origin's general schematic. We're going in blind." The group now felt frustrated at the roadblock. 

"Hmm... Take this." Looking at her core, it shone bright blue, and information were transferred to their Iris. 

Noah: "Wh-what's this?"

Eunie: "Is this... Origin?" In their iris displayed Origin's blueprints. 

"A certain Nopon engineer was involved on the Agnian side of Origin's construction." She turned to look at the blast furnace in the room, reminiscing.{{footnote: Go, go, Poppi!}} "That's an early blueprint, left behind from those days. The Great Sea's vortex... is likely born from the force field emitted by this middle part, amplified by the structure built up around the circumference. That would be my best guess, anyway. As for the original purpose of the structure, it was a device to deploy a field to protect the facility while it generated an omni-static space. Consequently, this middle section here... It lacks the armored shell, making it Origin's only weak point." The blueprint showed a blue line conjoin to the outer shell, perhaps allowing an entrance? One don't know. Or maybe they can just enter from the middle part. 

Mio: "Hmmmmm...."

Noah: "So then, basically, this is our entrance."

"Enter the vortex, and then using its flow, break through to the inside." Yeap, it's correct: a duct as an entrance to enter the middle part. "Once you are within, destroy the force field generator at the center. That's the trick."

"Yes I see..."

"However, the internal structure of Origin may well have been heavily modified by Z. _Even after you make it in, you must be on your guard_."

"Understood. We'll be fully prepared."

Lanz felt relieved, "Huh! You gotta hand it to the Queen, though. **How could anyone** know all that?!"

Eunie: "Shocking, I know!"

Even Taion was impressed, "**Absolutely. I simply, cannot believe this!**"

Mio was feeling tired hearing their flattering praises, blandly asked, "C'mon, you lot, make your minds up already, will you?"

After they exit the door of the Queen's chambers, Mio: "By the way! After you met up with M, you were sleeping here all this time, right?"

Nia, whom accompanied them to the door, answered, "Yes."

"So then, how did you know we'd become Ouroboros? You seemed to know what had happened at the Castle as well..."

She turned around and looked at the blast furnace, explained, "Even as I sleep, I learn. Information on everything in this world collects right here."

Noah: "**Thank you so much, for all this! I promise you, we will seize the future!**" Now gone for good. The Queen watched them leave, then gave herself a 'yeah' dance. Her acting was successful again!

> **Translator's Note:** That extra member in a medium-sized Levnis is Segiri{{footnote: Segiri is the name given to her by Sena, because she doesn't have a name, only a number.}}, but that's not important in the story. 

Outside by the beginning of the ladder leading up to Cloudkeep on the tip of the mountain, the group gathered and discuss their next step. Sena started first, "That's the first bit of Origin metal taken care of!"

Just then, Noah received "Oh, a call from Mr. Samon!"

The group joined the call, and here come Mr. Samon, "Meh-llo? Friends and first part now?"

Lanz: "Yeah, just a moment ago. You've got good timing, man!"

"What friend saying? Samon placed call after see source of signal moving. Very evident proof of obtain."

"Oh... Well, uh, you know what I say to that? **Meh!**{{footnote: Something that caused Lanz to say Meh is real meh!}}"

Taion estimated the distance from the Cloudkeep, "His sensors could detect such a small displacement? Truly impressive..."

Noah: "Mr. Samon, I'm guessing since you called us..."

"Ah, yes! Have finished location data analysis... For only two places, however. In north of Aetia region, and east of Cadensia region. Those two signals, Samon could triangulate for more precision. Data just updated, so please to check."

"We got it. Thanks again, Mr. Samon."

"Not to worries. Please to keep up good work!"

After they hung the call, Mio summed up, "So, Aetia and Cadensia next, huh?"

Taion: "The one in Aetia is... Huh, in Everblight Plain...? And for Cadensia, data seems to be pointing to Cape Arcaphor in the Erythia Sea."

Eunie: "Right-o! Let's get on with it, loves."

---

By a waterfall, Riku checked his terminal: "Oho! Location of treasure is seemingly behind waterfall!"

Mio: "That's unexpected..."

Eunie: "Explains how it went undiscovered, at least."

Noah: "All right, let's go."

---

Behind the waterfall was a cavern, and a GIANT piece of Origin metal (2x the size of Sena) stuck into the ground. Mio announced, "Got it!"{{footnote: Stupidly, that counts as "1" Origin metal, the same as the palm-size one the Queen gave to them. How much dilution is there?}}

Sena: "Together with the one we got from Her Majesty, that makes two."

Taion: "It's good luck that we found it so quickly. We can only hope the other pieces will come to us just as smoothly..."

Mio: "Let's track down the metal in Aetia."

Noah: "All right!"

---

By the war-ridden land where we first met Noah, Eunie, and Lanz fighting in Chapter 1, Riku checked his terminal and announced, "Oho! Signal of Origin metal coming clear. Must be near now. This starting to feel like treasure hunt. Riku get kind of excited."

Lanz: "You know, you've got a point. It **is** kinda like one big world-hopping treasure-hunting adventure."{{footnote: To know how much time they traveled before from one region to other and Mio only got slightly more than a month left arriving at the City on the other side of Aionios, and now they can jump here and there in hours!}}

Eunie: "All right, calm down. Where's the signal, then?"

Tucking his terminal away, he looked at a direction, "It coming from over that way. If judge by distance reading, probably behind that ridge.{{footnote: That's a big rock that blocked their sight.}}"

Sena: "Hey Manana, race you for it!"

"OK, but Manana not give up easy!" And the two dashed off like two kids running for the end point, leaving the others in dust. 

---

Arriving at the location, similar huge chunk, but stuck deeper into the soil, Noah: "I guess this is it...?"

After retrieving, Lanz concluded, "That's the... uh... third one, right?"

Eunie: "Half down, half to go."

Riku suddenly felt (perhaps vibration) in his terminal. Taking it out, he announced, "Meh? Oh, new data just arrive from Samon."

Noah, checking his Iris, "It looks like we're going to... the Pentelas region, and Fornis."

Mio triangulated, "This part of Pentelas... It's Maktha Wildwood, I think?"

Sena: "And as for Fornis, looks like Zain's Talon."

---

Along a sandy desert where there was a ring buried in the sands, rainbow-colored mist floating in the area, Riku checked his terminal, "Hrumm... Very strange. Riku see reading of Origin metal, but not anything that could fit bill."

Taion: "The coordinate data does seem to be pointing us here."

Lanz: "That mean Mr. Samon's done goofed?"

Mio: "It doesn't seem very likely... Well, not _too_ likely, at least..."

Noah: "Is it possible that it could be buried under the surface...?"

Eunie was intimidated by such possibility, "Oh, you've got to be joking. Please don't tell me we're gonna have to dig this whole place up."

Sena got the wrong message, "**Dig the whole place up, got it!**" Yeah, muscle girl!

"Queen's cuticles, I'm gonna hate this..."

---

After 'culling the field', they finally found it. Sena: "Here it is!"

Taion: "That's the fourth one."

Riku: "Not long now."

Eunie: "So, Pentelas region next...?"

---

At the bottom of Maktha Forest, a giant brog{{footnote: frog}} with long purple-ish ears, greenish body, and dark-gold claws stood in their way. "Riku check and double-check, but bad news is same. Signal come from that Rhana..."

Manana: "That mean Rhana ate it?"

Taion, scratching his head, "Based on the circumstances, that does seem to be the firmest hypothesis we have..."

Lanz was ready, "'Kay, well, let's just punch it in the gut and see what comes up!"

Eunie was yucked, "Blergh... Dibs, not me! Not touching it, no way no how." But the fighting was group work, don't need to touch it anyways, since you're using a rifle. 

---

After killing it, Lanz walked forward and did the dirty job, digging his hands into its stomach and searched through, until he felt some metal-ish object, pulled it out, "Origin metal, lovely jubbly."

Eunie: "...How can you handle that with a straight face?"

Lanz, handling out the metal to her, "You want a closer look?" That not only alerted her, even Riku and the others backed away.

"**STOP IT! KEEP THAT THING AWAY FROM ME, YOU CLOD!!!**"

Mio: "Only one left to go." All checking their Iris, Mio announced, "We got some new data from Mr. Samon..."

Noah: "The final piece of Origin metal is waiting us in..."
