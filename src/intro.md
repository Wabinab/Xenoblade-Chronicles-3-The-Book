# Introduction

One wrote lots of blogs, but all styled non-fictitious. Reading lots of non-fiction books made one not adept at writing fictitious style. Yet, there are histories one read which wrote in fictitious style. This is the book one tries to first write. 

Yet, creating a story from scratch proved too hard for one. Translating the cutscenes into words, with an existing movie, allow one to focus on the writing. Furthermore, one really like Xenoblade Chronicles 3. Perhaps, it's time to put it into words. That's one's principle. Write what one like. 

Perhaps this book will never be publicized, for it's the first attempt. Plus, one might get into copyright trouble, who knows? It'll stay private, for now.
