# Terms

Here are some terms highlighted in the book. 

- **Ferronis:** The colony levnis, flame clock levnis, flame clock war machine. People live in it, or under it, when the colony isn't at war. 
- **Flame Clock:** The clocklike figure located at the top of a Ferronis. The flame clock determines the strength of its soldiers. If the flame clock falls to zero, those linked to that flame clock lose their lives. 
- **Levnis:** The war machines that Agnus and Keves soldiers used in their war. With higher technology, the Agnian levnises could be autonomous, while Kevesi levnises were almost always piloted by a living soldier, except for the one the protagonist built, taking inspiration from Agnian's levnises. Agnian levnises also are capable of antigravity technology, floating their torso above a rounded ball, like the tracking ball in a mouse. Keves levnises use the old-fashioned-but-reliable wheels. 
- **Nopon:** Egglike inhabitants, whom shared their head with their torso, hands shaped like wings, and very short legs. Their usual height ranged below moderate human's thigh. Nopon are usually merchants, but like all inhabitants, there are other Nopons with other skills.
