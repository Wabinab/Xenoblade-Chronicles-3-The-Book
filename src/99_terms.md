# Terms

Here are some terms highlighted in the book. More of these information could be found in the [Xenoblade Wiki](https://xenoblade.fandom.com/wiki/)

- **Colony Ranks:** (from the Wiki) Assigned by the castle, it determined their priority in receiving supplies and luxury. In reality, they were created to motivate them to fight furiously, and when they reached Gold, a moebius will come and eliminate them, as they had no way to advance anymore, hence lost their motivation. The ranks, from low to high, are: 
  - Dirt
  - Tin
  - Copper
  - Iron
  - Steel
  - Silver
  - Gold
- **Ferronis:** The colony levnis, flame clock levnis, flame clock war machine. People live in it, or under it, when the colony isn't at war. 
- **Flame Clock:** The clocklike figure located at the top of a Ferronis. The flame clock determines the strength of its soldiers. If the flame clock falls to zero, those linked to that flame clock lose their lives. 
- **Iris:** Every soldier, Agnian or Kevesi, had an Iris that used for transferring information. Though, this Iris also send information back to the castle; hence Noah's team current location was always known prior to wearing the eyepatch. Linked to the flame clock, the moebius could press a button and their mind would be put to sleep, their body continued fighting against their will. Upon waking up, they won't remember what had happened, except for the sore muscles from muscle memory. 
- **Levnis:** The war machines that Agnus and Keves soldiers used in their war. With higher technology, the Agnian levnises could be autonomous, while Kevesi levnises were almost always piloted by a living soldier, except for the one the protagonist built, taking inspiration from Agnian's levnises. Agnian levnises also are capable of antigravity technology, floating their torso above a rounded ball, like the tracking ball in a mouse. Keves levnises use the old-fashioned-but-reliable wheels. 
- **Nopon:** Egglike inhabitants, whom shared their head with their torso, hands shaped like wings, and very short legs. Their usual height ranged below moderate human's thigh. Nopon are usually merchants, but like all inhabitants, there are other Nopons with other skills. 
- **Off-Seer:** Soldiers who "oversee" dead soldiers. Performing an off-seer ritual send the souls trapped lingering in the battlefield to Heaven, releasing them of their need and utmost desire to continual fighting even after their death. The off-seer ritual consisted of playing a melody. The melody slightly differs with Kevesi and Agnians, because Kevesi's black flute (Noah's original flute) is longer than Agnian's white flute (Mio's original flute); hence the longer flute produced a deeper and lower tone than the shorter ones. The real flute is/was available for sell, try search online! 
- **Power Frame:** Kevesi soldiers are generally weaker than Agnians. To balance the strength, they wore power frame to boost their strength. Moebius probably prevented the spread of power frame to the Agnians, to ensure their balance of power. 
- **Queen:** The assumed ruler of both Kevesi and Agnians. The Kevesi Queen was Melia Antiqua, from Xenoblade 1, resided in the castle that resembles Imperial Capital Alcamoth; the Agnian Queen was Nia, from Xenoblade 2, one is unsure of (or forgot about) the structure resemblance of the castle.
