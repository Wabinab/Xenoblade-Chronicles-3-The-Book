# The Operation, Ouroboros, and Moebius

=== 

Night time, at the fireplace. Noah checked his iris: "It's almost time. Let's review the details of the operation. Our mission objective lies in Alfeto Valley. An unidentified ether source has been reported. We are tasked with surveying it and destroying it."

"Waypoint marked out on map now. Please to have look at waypoint on map!" Riku added. 

The party nodded. Noah continued: "The advance party should have already arrived at the planned contact point."

Eunie: "It's time we headed out too, then!" 

Lanz was getting excited: "Let's get the snuff out of here. A royal decree, eh? I don't know about all this... But let's get out there and square it away as quick as we can!" 

---

They ran along the path, stopped by some feet before a cliff. A few specks of purple particles can occasionally be seen floated in the night sky. They knelt down and looked out, Lanz asking: "It's really supposed to be here? I don't see much." 

"Shh" Noah checking his iris to scan the horizon. Agnian levnises, one like before, floated on a rolling ball with two blades on its arms; another slightly larger levnis defies gravity, floated on the ground, like wearing a white coat and two ball on its shoulders, travelling in the distance. "Agnian troops." 

Eunie: "Seriously?"

Noah: "They're still far off. They haven't spotted us."

Lanz: "Goin' in?" 

Noah looked back at him from the tip of his sight: "We don't have permission to engage. The only thing we need to focus on... is our target." 

He tried to communicate the other squads with his iris, but an error screen popped up with the error message, written: "Communications down due to **black fog** interference."{{footnote: So the purple particles were emanated from the black fog?}}

He quickly pointed to a faceless soldier, asked him to come forward to him. "What?" 

"Heads up. Enemies at two o'clock. Go tell the main force. I'm worried about Mwamba and the others. I think we'll go on alone." 

"Ok then. I'll handle it." The faceless soldier ran towards the other faceless soldiers and levnises behind. Noah and the others ran in a different direction, descending the cliff from the ledge beside. 

As they dashed past and reached another ledge, Noah and the group knelt down while he used his iris to scanned the situation. After a while, a "commence mission" came onto the center of the screen. Meanwhile, Kevesi levnises make a move and fired their cannons at an invisible ship, the blast send turmoils on the invisible shield. 

Not far away, Agnian levnises also fired their cannon at the vehicle. The vehicle's invisible shield was suffering blast that it almost cannot maintain its invisibility. 

Noah was watching from a distance: "Is that it? It's not Kevesi... Definitely not Agnian either..." 

Lanz: "The spark is that?"

Finally, the invisibility status was lost. A ship, seen army green under the orange light from the blast, was suffering damage at its hull. It had several pixels of light by its side, an engine attached to its back emanates a yellow-orange hue. 

While suffering damage, some tubes were released from its belly, turning to face the ground. It turns out to be rocket nozzle, small flames emit from its tip to control its balance while it landed onto the ground. 

Eunie: "It's coming down." Alas, before it could balanced, its belly hit onto a ledge too high, damaging its belly in the process. Sparks and flames flew from the damaged position, before it dragged along the ground. A ring came fell out from one of the pixelated lights. It dragged for some distance before stopping. Noah stood up with the others, prepared to take action. 

Meanwhile, the Kevesi and Agnian soldiers were busy warring each other before they take a look at their target. Beams and bullets flew towards each other. Levnises destroyed. All tried to prevent the others from getting after their target before them. 

Lanz exclaimed: "Starting without us!" 

Noah: "We need to keep moving. Head to the target." 

Eunie: "You got it." 

---

An Agnian levnises suffered a blast, rolled backward, destroyed in the process. Noah and the others was panting after the strenuous fight. More Agnian levnises coming behind them. They turned and faced their direction, running towards the Agnian soldiers and killing them. An Agnian levnis sword beamed up, firing a sword at Noah. Lanz saw it, quickly ran in front, stuck his sword to the ground, and generated a frequency shield. The sword pinched into the frequency shield, itself rotating, and the shield broke into pieces in a second. Before the Agnian levnis could retreat the sword, Kevesi blasted its way and it bursted into flames. It was from the sharp-tipped Kevesi levnises, which continued to fire more shots at other levnises.

Lanz and Noah looked at each other for a second, before running off in opposite direction. Lanz recalled his blade, made a swing as he approached 3 soldiers. 

As some faceless Kevesi soldiers were injured, Eunie stuck his staff on the ground, and a healing ring rejuvenate their strengths while they glowed green. She turned her staff around, as if she had eyes behind her head, and made a shot, which brought down one of the Agnians above a ledge below a tree. Then, she stuck her staff onto the ground once more, this time, an orange ring (support ring) became active, the soldiers glowing the same color, got stronger. 

Noah jumped down from a ledge, seeing Kevesi and Agnians soldiers fighting one on one in the distance, hit the ground and get running. The last of the Kevesi was outmatched, and Agnians turned their attention towards him, exchanging blows. While he was outnumbered, only one soldier fought him while others didn't disturbed.{{footnote: Movie always have some stupid scene. In real life, you'd have outnumbered them in the first place, not letting your colleague wasting their energy in a duel, and not giving your enemy any chance.}} Noah was knocked back, looked for his chance, and with a few blows, brought the 3 Agnians down, husks glowing red. 

He noticed his flame clock filling up: "My Flame Clock... It's filling up... but..." Turning to look at the sky, the "lives" actually doesn't float in any particular direction, nor the flame clock levnises nearby to absorb flame. That's probably the weird phenomena he noticed. 

Noah's team were walking up to where their target was. A robot appeared on the ground, it's fae was 3 beam of lights, head and torso as one. Upon detecting them as enemy, it raised its arms, fired bullets at them via the machine guns equipped. Noah summoned his blade to slice the shots, before Lanz raised a frequency shield a second later. The automaton started walking towards them, another automaton rose from the ground and followed. 

Eunie: "What *are* these things?" 

Riku: "There no pilot inside!" 

Lanz withdrew his broadsword, not needing the shield now: "They're automatons." 

---

(After they finished the battle)

Kevesi and Agnian were still warring each other. Flames were seen everywhere on the ground. Noah checked his iris, scanned the ship, and saw a bright green light floated in front, emanating green ring like how GPS point emanates blue ring from its centre dot. It's the ether source they were after. "Is that it?" 

Nodding to the others, they ran to it. 

---

More automatons were destroyed as they got near. Bullets were fired at the automatons. Boxes were piled everywhere behind the the ship. A large flame can be seen in a distance, while a small flame lit up near the boxes. 

One man was hiding behind the boxes, using it as a barrier. He fired weapon at the enemies. As he stood up and fire, we could see he wore a coat, had strong muscles. We can't see anything above his nose, but he had a moustache. The suppressing fire was too strong. He had to lay down behind the boxes. "Damn it! Fighting both of 'em? That's gonna be a tough break. But what did I expect?" 

Looking at the source of ether, an egg-shaped structure with some space between the upper half and lower half. Ether can be seen flowing inside it via the transparent glass, illuminating it. "They'll do just about anything... for our precious **Ouroboros Stone.**" 

Then, he stood up again to continue firing at the soldiers. Other of his group were also hiding behind barriers, helping him. An automaton was down again. 

The other guy, dark skin, oval face, wearing an eyepatch, looked at the muscular guy, "**Guernica**! That's the last of the Automatons! We won't last long!" 

Other people of his team, holding guns, wearing glasses or mask, firing. "The battle unit's still holding," Guernica shouted at the guy, replying, "Go, save yourself! Get that Stone to the **City**!" 

"Argh!" One of the battle unit was blasted down, dead. Seeing it down, Guernica signaled while he continued firing, "Zuo!" 

He make his way toward the battle unit named Zuo. Suddenly, a blast went the other way, and the eyepatch guy was down. "Arrrghhh!" 

Guernica turned and faced his direction. Seeing soldiers on top of the ledge, he fired at them, bringing them down. No more shots were firing at him, but he was also the last one from the City standing. 

He quickly rushed to the eyepatch guy to see if he can still be rescued, putting his hands on his shoulder. The guy, haven't died, held up his hands and bring it to his, "Guernica. S-sorry... I should... have been more... perceptive..." 

Guernica brought his hands up, held his palm with both hands, to reassure him. After some coughing, his head laid to the side. "Yew!" He put his hands down, put his heads over his corpse, "YEW!!!" 

---

Noah and his team was running fast towards the destination, hiding behind trees just before he arrived. Lanz iris scanned for details, saw themselves near the final destination. "There it is. The ether source." 

Eunie: "First there was those Automatons. Now another unknown weapon."

Noah was also confused like the others: "What in the flames... are we even fighting?{{footnote: It sounded weird though, because the sentences after this footnote seemed to bear different voice than the former, but it didn't sound like Lanz or Riki either}} No, not just us... Agnus too..." 

From a distance, Guernica was beside the Ouroboros Stone, "So you{{footnote: "you" means the Ouroboros Stone}} made it this far. It'll have to be here." He looked at the Stone, perhaps made a decision.

Eunie: "Noah. Look." 

Lanz: "Is that... a man?" {{footnote: Yes, they never saw a man outside of Kevesi and Agnian. That was their whole world.}}

Noah stood up: "He's no Agnian soldier. What is he? Was he controlling those Automatons, maybe?" He dugged down and made his way towards Guernica. Yet, before he could reached him, some paper units were flying towards him. Eunie quickly got out trying to save Noah. We could see a faceless Agnian controlling those paper units, with a single paper unit floating behind his left shoulder. 

Eunie fired shots at the Agnian soldier, while Lanz moved forward. To dodge, the Agnian soldier hid behind a tree trunk, bullets swooshed beside him. 

Another girl, wearing a white dress with orange linen, made her way towards Lanz. Her weapon composed of two rings, glowing yellow. She was masked. 

Lanz stuck his broadsword to the ground. It splits aside, and turned the handle 90 degrees to reveal a machine gun, which he fired at the girl. Yet, the girl had high agility, dodged all his shots, jumped onto the air, and landed while Lanz brought his sword up to shield against her hits. 

Noah reached Lanz on time, sliced his blade up at the intercepting region, separated them. Meanwhile, the paper weapon guy got up behind her. Another girl carrying a massive hammer, one that certainly looked larger given her short size, stood to the right. They were facing each other. 

"Kevesi troops..." The double-ringed girl sounded. 

"Three of 'em." Said the hammer girl. 

"It seems... we are just about the only ones left." The paper weapon guy spoke. Then, turned his head at the Ouroboros Stone, "And there's our objective." 

Eunie signaled to Noah for instructions: "Noah."

Noah, seeing they had no choice, raised his blade in affirmation, "Yeah. We'll have to fight." 

The paper guy: "Mio." 

The double-ringed girl, **Mio**, agreed with Noah too, "Got it." 

---

(Some fights later)

Noah sliced his blade and broke Mio's mask, shattered to pieces. It revealed a short silver hair, yellow-ochre iris, ears that resembles a cat. They continued to exchanged blows. Mio ran in a semicircle while Noah tried intercepting her. She turned and ran at Noah, continued fighting. 

Meanwhile, Guernica was looking at them fighting, "These kids are gonna end up stealing each other's life force..." He held up his hands, clenching it into a fish, "And me... I've robbed them even of that kindness." 

**Memories:** Guernica was driving an automaton{{footnote: perhaps not auto but manual}}, firing at Kevesi soldiers. 

As Noah and Mio splitted, the hammer girl emerged from Mio's side, running towards Noah, whom was shocked, "Huh?! Where did...?!" 

She jumped into the air, hammer about to smash onto Noah. "Call that a swing?" Lanz sounded from behind, intercept in front of Noah and made a frequency shield, "You're way too slow!" 

"He blocked it! No way!" The shield shattered into pieces, sending the girl up back into the air; but her mask also shattered. She is slightly tanned, small arms having ocean blue, as if ocean blue blood travelling through. On one side of her hair, flames of the same color continuously burning, certainly a feature, not her hair catching flames from external sources. She then made a backward somersault and landed beside Mio. 

Lanz wasn't in a good situation either, her hit was strong. "Gah! For a little munchkin, she sure packs a real wallop!" 

Meanwhile, paper weapons the shaped like kite with two wings, but drawn eyes onto it, were catching after Eunie. "Urg... How many of those cards has this geek got?!" She dugged down to face that direction. 

The cards were seen rotating around where he put his hands up, "There's no escape! When my **Mondo** have you... They'll follow you to the ends of the world!" His mask was also gone, not sure when. He looked very intelligent, hands touching his eyeglass. He had brown skin, thick hair. 

His mondo transformed into bird shape as he sent them against Eunie. "Spark that! Why don't you back off?!" She stuck her staff onto the floor. An unseen shockwave was sent in his direction, destroying some of the Mondo. He put his hands to his face, awestruck: "Ahh(gasp)... How did she fool my Mondo?!"

Eunie continued running while shouting at him, "Creep. Try following that!" 

Meanwhile, Mio and the hammer girl landed behind him, as he turned around. Eunie made his way to Noah and Lanz. Noah: "These guys are tough..." 

Eunie agreed: "I hate to say it, but I think you're right." 

Lanz: "These are no grunts. That gear... Special Forces?" He was pointing towards Mio's weapon. 

Eunie agreed: "Yeah, deffo. That'll be why they've got an off-seer with 'em." 

Mio ran towards them while Lanz prepared his machine gun, saying: "Well, so are we! Even-stevens, Right?!" 

Mio and the guy was running from both flanks, his cards flying in front of Mio to back her up. She landd in front of Eunie, one hit and knock her to the side. Fight Noah, yet his blades could not land a blow on her, "How can she react so quickly?! Can't seem to... hit her!" 

Finally, Noah seemed to landed a slice on her face. Mio groaned in pain, one hand at the pain, another holding towards Noah. 

"What's... What's that sound?" Ok, not a hit, but a sound that hurts Mio's ears. {{footnote: Cat had better hearings, but more sensitive to high pitch loud noise?}}

As they exchanged blows, Noah thought:{{footnote: **Anything in italics is inner thoughts, not spoken out.**}} "_She's so fast... And yet... her moves are really simple... It's almost... like they have a rhythm..._" And he realized something: "_The Agnian off-seeing tune? I know how that goes..._" He looked at her steps, counted, "_One, two, three, four... One, two, three!_" 

Noah turned and faced her side at Mio, to which Mio was shocked, "He's not even looking at me?!"

Noah, meanwhile, countinued counting, looking away to not be flooded with vision inputs, "_One, two, three, four... One, two..._" 

"There!" He shouted, sliced his sword vertically at Mio. It sliced and some shirt pieces flew off Mio. Shocked in her mind, "_He hit me?!_" She can't stop now, yet Noah already know her pace. Once slice up to the air threw one of her blades flying off, which she caught on a second later. "Why you...!" 

Noah suddenly realized something as he ran towards her, "_Hang on...The fighting's stopped?_" There was no sound coming from a distance. He looked around at the ledge while on his course, saw nobody else except for them: "_When did that...?_" Only Noah and Mio was still exchanging blows, while the others were already exhausted, panting as they bent on the floor. 

"_At this rate, one of us is going to get killed... No, maybe both of us will..._" He stopped, needed time to think, "_Something strange is going on. We shouldn't be fighting like this._" Unconsciously, he spoke out: "We should run!" He was surprised by what he just spoken, thought: "_Run? Was it... me who just said that?What is this? There's no time to think.. Have to trust my gut... This is all too real! I hope I'll be able to..._" 

Mio also stopped, one blade in front of her, gritted her teeth. Noah's thought continued: "_get through... to her...!_" Mio continued to ran towards Noah and fought. Noah wanted to communicate, blocking her shot while speaking: "You are an off-seer! From Agnus, right?!" 

"What the...?"

"So you are, then! Why are you fighting me?" 

"As if you can talk?! You're the ones attacking us! What, too scared to fight now? Too late!" 

"It's not to do with fear. It's that sound... You can hear it too, I know you can!" 

Running towards each other, Mio replied "We're fighting because there are enemies to kill! You think we'll just let you go?!" Meanwhile, Lanz and the others, after resting a bit, continued their fighting course. 

Noah seemed to not getting through to her: "_Ugh...! This is bad... At this rate...!_" Then prompted Mio, "Is that all you have to say, Agnus?" 

Meanwhile, Eunie was shooting at the guy, whom builded a shield with his Mondo. Noah landed a hit which Mio blocked, shouting to her: "I'm telling you..."

Mio shouted back: "Enough! I'm telling you that you're full of it! Take that!" His sword thrusted towards her, just a few centimeters from her neck. Her ring thrusting towards him, though short compared to the sword. Both dodged and did not kill each other even if they had the chance, looking at each other, after which they slid on the floor in opposing direction. 

Noah now questioned himself: "Do I really have to kill her? But she's so fast... If I lose focus for a second, I'm done for!" 

Mio, wiping her sweat, also speaking to herself: "These Kevesi off-seers... I thought they were just window dressing. But he's different... And there's his sword... What's up with that?" Noah's sword had blue blades, with a central green line (ether, maybe) running up the sword's skeleton, and a glowing blue ring where it joins with the handle. He shoved forward, slicing towards her. 

Guernica, watching the show for a moment now, also saw that something was different with Noah's blade, "Uh...? What's that?!" He then looked back at the Ouroboros Stone, the central line the same color with Noah's sword's skeleton color. "Ahh I see...{{footnote: So, it's the Ouroboros Stone that was in sync with his sword?}} I s'pose this is the reason I'm here then, eh? Heh! Guess this is what they call fate. Fine then. Time for Guernica Vandham... to make an entrance!" He unsheathed his flare pistol, pointing it into the air, and made a shot, the light emanated so bright that Noah and Mio had diverted their attention while their head almost hit one another. 

Guernica took the chance, ran up towards them while the flare is on air, one hand on Mio's face, another on Noah's. Noah: "What the...!" 

Guernica asked them, his hands moved and pressed on their shoulders instead, so strong both couldn't get up: "What do you all think you're doing? Why the fighting?!" 

Noah was having difficulty listening, "What's this... guy saying?" 

While he tried to get up, he pressed him back down onto the ground, asking, "Just why? Answer me!" The rest of both teams ran to their flanks, stopping by a distance. 

Mio asked while trying to get up, "What do you mean, 'why'? If I see an enemy, I fight! So don't you... interfere!!!" With the last word, she managed to break free of his grip, retreated to where her group was. She ran towards him, but he's so skilled that before she could start landing a hit, he already hit her in the stomach. She lost her energy, whole body relied on his hand for support. 

Guernica spoke: "Pull the wool from your eyes, kid." She lowered her, allowed her to fell to the ground. Then, he stood up straight, holding his right hand into a fist, "Think about your real target: that thing!" He pointed at the Ouroboros Stone; then punched his hands at his heart, leaned forward, "And me!" 

And he turned to face Eunie and the others, continued, "No, you just have your little scrap. D'you have any idea, who the real enemy is?" He held his fist up high into the air, "It's over!" and he punched down towards where Mio and Noah were, the ground broke into pieces, sending shockwaves and soil while both flew backwards, gasping. 

His hand dangling from his shoulders, Guernica asked again, "Now. Is that all you need to fight? Truly? That's all?" He looked up at the sky. 

Mio and the other stood up, while the Mondo guy explained, "Of course. Countless comrades have lost their lives, thanks to this filth." 

Lanz walked forward, looking at the guy, "Oh really now? I could say the exact same thing. What'd you think it's like for us? Losing friend, after friend..." He didn't stopped, continued walking towards Mio and her team. They got ready into a defensive stance. "You steal everything from us!" 

Eunie got up from behind Lanz, "You think we're even just because both sides do some killing? What good's filling up these flickering Clocks in our eyes! It'll never replace the friends we've lost. That's why!" Her blue eyes glowed with the flame clock. 

Noah reasoned: "We aren't fighting because we _want_ to." 

Eunie was awed, drew back her flame clock, looked back at him, questioned, "We're not?"

Noah continued, walking forward: "We can see our lives written before our eyes. Fighting is all we have! Is it any wonder... we lose loved ones? Or have to take them from others?" He stopped beside Guernica. "All of us... We have to fight so we can go on living!" {{footnote: Perhaps this was the thing he had been thinking about for so long, lost in his mind without ever saying it out.}} 

Mio seemed not to think about it before, drew a breathe at his conclusion. 

Noah looked down to the side, questioned and raised his voice, "Just who decided that this was how it should be? If I knew who they were, or where, I'd..." He paused to think of what actions he would take, while Guernica interrupted him. 

"I know who they are. You'll what?" He went up to him, shadowing and questioning him. 

Noah looked up at him. Guernica scanned his attire, prompted, "You're an off-seer, eh?" He put his hands on his chin, thinking. The blade was emanating a sharp sound. "I guess I can trust you with this. You better listen up now." He walked up to him and put his hand on his shoulder. 

"'Cause the face of your real enemy is..." Suddenly, a yellow shot fired at him before he could have spoken anything, sending him down. Purple sparks emanate from where the bullet had thrusted through his chest, while he dropped to the ground. Noah, seeing him fall, ran up to him, but turned his attention to the bullet direction as the Mondo zoomed past him. 

Meanwhile, Mio's team joined with Noah, the Mondo and Lanz's getting into defensive position. A giant creature with horns, two core on the center of its torso{{footnote: not necessarily his/her chest, just torso, too dark to see what exact body part it is}}, purple with 2 rings, with an "infinity" sign on the middle, walked out from the black fog, the floor thud with each step. 

On the same side, Mwamba appeared from behind a tree bark, which Noah reflected unconsciously, "Mwamba..."

Mwamba murmured back to Noah, "N... Noah! I... I messed up..." He was held on the right hand of the giant creature. The creature looks like a monster, with red muscles, we can see blue indigo horns the shape of a bull horn glowing in the dark, having sharp eyes of a jaguar, like the red-suit guy. A leaf-shaped openings glows indigo on its biceps, with other openings of various shapes at its belly and hips. We now see the two infinity rings at his chest and above his belly. A ring horizontally aligned floats on its hips, like when you play a hula hoop, except it didn't touches. It had sharp teeth. On his left hand, Mio's colleague was held, raised his hands towards her, "H... Help me, Mio...!" 

"Hackt!" Mio shouted back. 

Noah's blade was reverberating at a frequency. He almost couldn't hold onto it. "My Blade... What the...?" 

He looked up{{footnote: no time to figure out what the heck is going on with his blade}}, hearing groans in agony, "Mwamba?!" 

The monster continued walking in their direction. Lanz was sounding scared, "Wh-what is that thing?!" 

Eunie replied, "Never seen anything like that before..." She seemed to recalled something from another hyperspace

> **Eunie's memories**: A monster like this, but without horns, came up upon the adult Eunie. 

Meanwhile, Lanz was trying to get her back, "Eunie! Eunie! What's wrong?!" Eunie's eyes was wide open, mouth gasping, taking her step backwards. The fear emanates in her even if she can't recall anything from this terms. "What is it? Seen that thing before?!" 

Eunie couldn't believed what she recalled, "No, h-how could I have?" 

Lanz: "Noah?"

"No, never. This is no normal creature... It's something else." 

It's eyes gleamed with an infinite, a moebius string glowing in it, like how their flame clock glowed. It spoke: "Oi, oi! Don't go stopping on my account. Get back to killin' each other! Come on. I thought that was your whole 'raison d'être'?" 

Mio was shocked, "It's... speaking?!" 

Guernica hadn't died yet, though badly injured, hands on where he was shot: "M-**Moebius**..." 

Moebius continued: "What's wrong? Too worried about your buddies to fight?" He{{footnote: We'll assume it's male, for it sounded male-ish.}} held them up a little, then turned, "Can't have that! All right!" He held them higher up into the air while Noah looked at him pressing his arms, ending their lives, their husks falling onto the ground. 

"Mwamba!" Noah shouted. Mio gasped. He looked like he ate Mwamba and Hackt. 

Lanz: "Grgh, you scum!" 

Moebius: "Oh, wow. This is some entertainment." He showed his hands at the Ouroboros Stone, "Two rival factions, murdering each other over one little rock." Turned back and faced them: "Well! Your objective is staring you in the face! Try and take it! 'Course, you'll be dead before you can lay a finger on it." He sat down on the floor. "Don't you just love it? Don't you wanna savor it? The sweet taste of a life cut short!" 

Lanz: "Ngh... You mudder!" Lanz and Eunie can't stand it anymore, runnin towards it. Noah was trying to hold them back,

"Wait, Lanz! Eunie!" ran after them. 

"You killed Hackt!" Mio ran towards him too. 

"Mimi!" the hammer girl signaled to Mio, ran up and followed. 

The intelligent guy couldn't hold it back, though it's an unintelligent move, "Spark!" And ran after them. 

Meanwhile, Guernica struggled to get up, controlling the manual automaton from a distance. It's flames shot from its rocket nozzle, getting started up. 

The moebius put one blast at Noah and Mio's team, and they were down. Smoke raised where he blasted from. It raised its arm to slice through, Lanz shielded in front of Noah. 

Before he could land a blow, Guernica was handling the manual robot, in the driver's seat, hit and dragged the Moebius from the flanks, dragging it along the ground. The robot arm gripped onto the moebius hands, "Hmph. Well... What did I expect?" It stand up and grabbed the robot's arm, the robot 2 times taller than him. "That's about... all you're... good for!" It swings, together with the robot, and flinched it into the distance. The robot dragged along, Guernica's upper torso resting on the entry door. 

"Well, crud. Helluva throwing arm." The hand of the robot had broke away, still holding in the MOebius's hands, he threw it aside. 

Guernica: "But y'know... I ain't... takin' that lying down!" As he finished his sentence, he aimed the robot's machine gun and fired at the moebius. Most hits missed, while some, the Moebius waved his hands and deflected it to the side, shot one of its fingernails (the thing that hit Guernica earlier) towards the robot, which exploded in flames. 

Moebius then bent onto the floor, took more stored energy, jumped into mid-air towards him. It landed a punch so hard it shattered the robots' glasses, with Guernica groaned in pain. It then stuck its hand through the window at Guernica, left hand ready to punch him. Noah was looking at the drama all the time. 

Moebius caught Guernica and bring him up on his arms. 

Noah: "Leave him alone..." His eyes glowed blue, and he started running towards the Moebius: "Let him go!" Lanz and Eunie followed behind. Mio and his team followed. The Mondo guy took a second to deide whether to follow or not, before finally deciding it's not good to let the team deal with himself out, then caught up. 

It gripped on Guernica, red sparks of "lives" drew from his body, while moebius let Guernica fall down. Noah launched himself into the air, blades up high, slicing towards the Moebius. He missed and landed beside Guernica. 

Moebius sniped: "Tsk. Don't get on yer high horse. You're nothing more..." He stood up, hands glowed with indigo particles and red electricity, gather into a ball of energy. He jumped into the air, punched the ball of energy at Noah. "than a grunt!" 

Noah flew backward, Lanz caught him. 

Moebius: "You've got a real death wish. Maybe I'll take care of you first! How 'bout that!" He pointed his fingers at them, and get into a fighting stance.
