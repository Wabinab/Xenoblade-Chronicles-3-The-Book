# Arriving at the City, Their Purpose, How Life Was Born, The First Ouroboros

The group closed in on the great sword. Higher platforms and eroded cliff rocks still lurked on both sides of the path. Giant fungi-like plants dominated the flora habitat. Air was slightly foggy. 

The group stopped and looked up, with Eunie commenting at the scenery, "Phwoo... Well aren't you a ginormous sparker!"

Sena: "Whoa... Where's the top?!"

Noah: "We finally made it, huh..."

Taion: "Quite..."

Mio breathed out with awe, until he heard Noah, "Let's get to the base of the sword. Guernica told us to come here. There has to be something."

Lanz warned, "Be on your guard, yeah? 'Cause we've **reeealllly** been pushing our luck lately."

Eunie teased back at him, "Whoooa... That's one for the books."

"Shaddup."

Noah: "Lanz is right, though. Keep your eyes peeled." They still have some route to take. 

---

> **Translator's note on environment:** Green fog enshrouded the environment. Pink, or reddish colored deer lurked the area of short trees with reddish leaves, and is that a lake? Floating jelly fish soared low above the ground. There was a firefly in the distance. Fungi, short or tall, shared the land with the trees with coral-looking leaves. Caterpillars, wolves, and eagles made it their home. There are small patches of grass with easily-ignored flowers. This, is **Great Sword's Base**, of Cadensia Region. 

---

Mio was daydreaming as they continued, when some soft sounds caught her attention. She stopped and looked up. Noah, noticing her actions, queried, "What's wrong? Mio?"

"I hear... a strange sound."

"Sound?" The group waited for whatever's lurking. A few moments later, the sound of spinning engine blades grew. 

Taion questioned, "Wh-what is that noise?!"

Sena alerted, "Something's wrong here! **Noah**!"

Noah tried to sense where the sound came from. As he triangulated their position, he looked up and saw two Lost Numbers' ships exiting their cloak, slowly lowering themselves onto the ground before them. As the doors lowered, soldiers leave the ship,surrounded their flanks. The group called their weapons and be prepared for battle. 

Eunie: "Wh-what the-? Who are they?"

Noah: "Those Levnises{{footnote: He meant the ship}}... They're the ones that attacked the Castle."

Taion already noticed, "Yes, no question."

Lanz: "Which means...?"

A woman leave one of the ship, with the girl that picked up Guernica's eyepatches and followed them to the hovering reefs accompanying behind as a sidekick. Both were wearing eyepatches. They stop as the older woman, the one in the lead, observed the group. 

Mio was observing one of the solders. They weren't drawing their weapons, just had his/her hands crossed, wearing a brown helmet with two holes for the eyes, the screen so dark she can't see his eyes. Noah was upset, moved his feet and stood in front of Mio, to protect her. Mio eyes widened at his gesture. The woman eyes tightened at what she saw. Then, she approached them. 

Before she arrived, the brown helmet guy spoke to Noah, "Sheathe your weapons. We're not looking for a fight."

"What the-?"

Another guy to the left of the first guy explained. "We are the Lost Numbers. Sworn enemies of Moebius."

Eunie: "What?"

Taion was equally shocked, "There are others standing against Moebius?!"

Now that the woman and the girl arrived, the group turned their attention to the two, the only two that didn't wear a helmet. 

"The name's **Monica.** Monica Vandham." She wore black tight shirt that suits for fighting, perhaps fighting suit, including gauntlets and leggings. She had short hairs, and some creeks{{footnote: wrinkles}} on her eyes. The eyes had brown iris, slightly thick eyebrows and eyelashes, with average-sized ears. Neck-long brown hair, coarsely wiggly. "The man who entrusted Ouroboros to you... I'm his daughter."

Eunie: "'Daughter'...?" She clearly hadn't heard of the phrase before, given that they are the only generations that don't need to give birth to anyone. 

Noah: "You know Guernica?"

She nodded, continued, "You're headed for the City, ain't ya?"

Mio: "How do you-?"

"That's our base of operations. Come on."

"Wha...?!" While she try to convince them, they hadn't put down their weapons. 

"**Shania**. Take point." Monica spoke to her sidekick, the girl with two pony tails, thin eye brows, large turquoise iris, and neck-long hairs on both side that covered her ears. She also wore a fighting suit, presumably a fighting suit, with dark red stripes on the edges. Oh, on their eyepatches, there was a symbol, presumably the symbol that represents the Lost Numbers, like the symbols we had on our flags. 

"Yeah, all right." Shania took steps towards the group, stopped just a few steps in front of them. 

Sena: "Uh?" 

She scanned the group for a second before speaking, "Stay close." Then, she turned and lead the way, didn't bother to wait for them. Noah looked at Mio over his shoulders, and they both nodded to each other. Sheathing their weapons, the group followed Monica and Shania while the other soldiers watched them off. 

---

Manana turned to look at the shades of red caressed by the evening sun; the group followed glance; she commented, "Levnis from earlier disappeared in sky."

Monica, now had another two helmet-soldier sidekicks, agreed, "Yep. Oh, and before we take you to the City, you have to wear these." The helmet soldiers walked up to the group and distributed them eyepatches; these without any logos on them. 

Noah: "Eyepatches?"

Pointing to her own eyepatches, Monica remarked, "They're the same as the ones we wear. Put them over the eye where your Iris is." Seeing them feeling dubious, she continued, "What? They won't hurt you." Noah turned to the group; they tacitly nodded to each other. 

---

(After wearing their eyepatches)

Monica checked that all had wore it before she continued, "Thanks for the cooperation. We appreciate this." Noah and Mio looked at each other, still aren't sure what the eyepatches are for. Monica cared to explain, "So, I said we aren't hostile, but that might not be enough to earn your trust, I'm guessing. If it lays your fears to rest, you can treat me as your prisoner until we reach the City."

Noah was surprised at the notion, "Huh?"

Eunie seconded, "Yeah, that doesn't sound right, darlin'."

"Don't want a prisoner? Whatever, I'll be your escort then. I should point out, you won't find anyone better with a mace in the Lost Numbers."

Lanz sniped back with hostility, "Yeah, well, don't bash us about with it or anything."

"If I wanted to, then your attitude would have earned you a thrashing already." To which he just waved his hands on the air, whatever...

Then, Monica walked closer to Noah and examined him; the group wasn't sure what she's up to. Noah just turned to Mio and both nodded to each other. Monica stopped her observation, turned to Shania, whom was losing patience, and continued, "So, let's be on our way. Shania'll show you how to go." She was probably relived it was time to go. 

---

The group arrived at the base of the sword, stopped there. Lanz turned to Monica and questioned, "... And how are we meant to get to the City from here?"

Sena: "Um yeah, this is a dead end."

Monica: "Wrong." Shania walked up and the group watched the wall slid to the side; they were shocked. 

Manana: "MEH?!"

Eunie: "A door!"

Monica: "This leads into the Great Sword. The City's this way."

As the group walked up to the door, Taion examined it and commented, "What a masterful disguise." The door was probably very thick, probably 3 meters thick, seemingly made of metal. It's a wonder how much force required to slide it apart. 

Mio: "Huh. When Ethel said there was nothing of interest in Swordmarch..."

Noah: "Guess she never found this."

Shania was losing her patience, urged, "Hey, you guys done? Can we get going?" She immediately walked into the great sword, which was a tunnel, the road seemingly made of metal tubings. There were sand/dirt that covered some cog wheels to the side. 

---

As the group ascended an elevator, the group stood on the side with the elevator button while the Lost Numbers on the other side, all except Monica facing them. Red lights seemed to blink on the elevator button. Eunie walked forward and started a conversation, "So, Guernica, that's... That wrinkly guy...? Back then?"

She turned to Noah, to which he nodded, "Yeah..."

"You said you were his 'daughter'. What's that mean?"

Monica: "I completely forgot... You don't understand the concept of parenthood. I'll explain later."

Taion: "'Later', meaning... In the City?"

"That's where the elevator's taking us." Noah and Mio gasped, perhaps finally to arrive at their destination. Monica continued, "You'll be needing those eyepatches now."

Noah: "And what for?"

"Those... put a spanner{{footnote: 'Spanner' means 'wrench' online, but by contextual meaning, it probably means 'block' or 'apocrypha'.}} in Moebius's recon."

"Moebius's?!"

She nodded and continued, "When you become Ouroboros, your Irises change. And they start emitting a weak radio signal. And so... we're blocking that signal."

"With these things...? What about yours? Are you... Ouroboros too?"

"Eh, we'll go with that."

"Sorry...?"

"Ya see..." She removed her eyepatches temporarily{{footnote: Not scared of the Moebius receiving the signal temporarily, eh?}} to show the yellow Ouroboros symbol on her Iris, "We're bound by Ouroboros blood." 

The helmet guy removed his helmet, revealed a face of slightly tanned, short thick hair, brown iris, average ears, nothing too special to describe. The other guy also removed his helmet, urr, more pale skinned, maybe? They're about the same height. Both wore the eyepatches too. {{footnote: Sorry, one had deficiency describing faces, deficient with vocabularies to describe faces, and how to describe faces. Never studied it before, and haven't study it yet.}} Monica wore back her eyepatches. 

That makes the group more confused, Noah asking, "Just what... are you?"

Meanwhile, the elevator finally came to a halt before he had his chance to receive an answer. 

---

The peak of the sword was covered with snow. A metal meshed platform attached to the ground stretches out from the main body of the sword. The group stepped on it and stopped by its edge. Clouds were far below; while individual features were difficult to observe, we could see islands isolated by large stretches of water. Straight ahead at the 'very edge of the world', was (presumably) Agnus's Castle. 

Lanz loved the scene, "Wahahahaha! We're so high up!"

Mio was enjoying it too, "What a view... I've never seen anything like it!"

Taion: "Certainly takes your breath away." They had a moment of silence, relaxed. 

Shania, impatient as usual, cut the group short, "Can you save your observations for later? _Come on!_" The group turned to see her already walking away, leading the way, not waiting for their reply. Monica didn't reject, followed behind her. 

---

> **Translator's note on environment:** This place of snowy metal peak had its own habitat. Bunnit roamed the area. There were metal joints not shielded by fences that connected from one end of the thin platform to another thin platform. Snow-looking eagles flapped their wings and landed to rest itself. A long-winged bird soared high above without rest. Fall off and you're in oblivion. This, is **Great Sword's Hilt**, without a region. 

---

"Entrance's up ahead." Shania nudged to turn right at the end of the path. Two automatons and two soldiers stood at each side of the door. There was a machine with several lines on one side, unsure what it controls. 

---

After the group entered the building, in a tunnel leading up to the city, with metallic walls, Shania and Monica removed their eyepatches, turned to the group, "You can take the eyepatches off now. Won't need them past this point."

Noah: "O-oh, right... And you're sure about that?"

"The City's got some signal-jamming tech that functions just like the eyepatches, blocking detection by Moebius. We're safe inside. You have my word."

Taion hypothesized, "I suppose that must be the reason why they haven't been able to discover the City thus far."

Monica agreed, "You got that right. This place is our last redoubt, and our sole haven in this world. But as soon as we step outside, Moebius are all over us, like a bad wool sweater. So what I'm saying is, don't forget your eyepatches when you're out and about. That's all."

Noah nodded, "I hear you, loud and clear. We'll remember." They proceed to remove their eyepatches.

---

> **Translator's note on environment:** Looking like an underground town without sunlight all day long, illuminated by light bulb surely, packed with buildings. Streetlights and shops opened on both side of the road. There were metal beams that connected above the road, with fluorescent lights installed on it. Kids were running around, some sat at the empty tables in between buildings seemingly made of metal boxes; adults just strolling or chatting with each other. Some buildings are tall, others are short; and there was an area where one of the ship parked, surrounded by containers. This, is the **City**, without a region.

---

=== (075: 1:17)

"This is the... City?" Mio and the others were flabbergasted! Nothing like they had ever seen before. They stood at a metal-grid platform above overlooking where the ship parked (and surrounded by containers, as mentioned just above). Monica and Shania were waiting for them, chatting with each other in a distance. 

Taion: "It sure took us long enough. We shouldn't relax just yet, though."

Eunie can't believe her ears, "Why the spark not?"

"We don't even know if they're really our allies yet. We can't get complacent."

Noah: "Still on guard, huh?"

He added some harshness to his tone, "Unlike some of your daydreamers, yes."

Noah turned to face the City's view, speaking with his back on him, "I'd like to believe them. Their eyes... They look the same as his." He was comparing Monica's to Guernica's. 

Mio recalled, "They said they opposed Moebius, didn't they? It should be OK then, to trust them...?"

Lanz agreed, "'The enemy of our enemy is our friend.' Gotcha!"

Taion: "Bloody sparks... Why do I bother?"

Noah appreciated, "Thank you, Taion. For looking out for us."

"Yeah, sure, whatever. I'll follow your lead. But please, stay vigilant." Eunie smiled at his reaction. 

Seriously speaking and nodding, "Of course we will."

---

"Ouroboros...?" By the path with shops to both side, a male and a female wearing brown leather jacket; the female pointed chin, large brown iris, brown neck-long hair, and the one whom voiced; the male gelled hair, similar colored iris, taller in posture. 

"Ouroboros, yeah." They weren't the only ones looking at the weird group like a monkey passing through in a zoo. Others stopped what they're doing and commented behind the scene. 

"So _they're_ Ouroboros?" The group continued walking as if they hadn't been watched, at least that's with Noah's leading. They didn't look at the people, to not face them yet. 

"And they're from Keves and Agnus...?"

"But they're just a bunch _o'kids!_"

"Watch yourselves! They could be secret spies!" Monica was accompanying the group from behind. 

"It's over... This place'll be a warzone."

Mio, her ears tall to catch the soft signal from the noise, commented, "They're all whispering about us..."

Lanz: "I feel... we're not exactly welcome here." They groups kept their voice low. 

Taion: "'Uninvited guests', one might say."

Eunie didn't understand, "They're the ones who led us here."

Then, something caught Sena's eyes, "Oh, hey..." It was a man/woman in front, lying by the barrels, looking at them. Sena continued, "Doesn't she look similar to the Moebius we fought at Colony 4?"

Riku: "It true... Wrinkly prunefaces abound here!"

Then, there happened to be kids running past them, going in the opposite direction. "Manana spy tiny people too! Is whole undiscovered race!"

Noah rejected her hypothesis, "No... They must be... humans just like us."

As they reached the '+' junction, a group approached from the right, and a man in lead called out, "So you're Ouroboros, eh?"

"Huh?" Noah stopped to face him; someone calling out directly to them than whispering for the first time in the City. Five person distinguishable but their facial features too difficult for translator to put into words. Though one had striking features: brown hair; the others black hair. All wore black suit, seemingly Lost Numbers' fighting suit. 

Another woman commented, "You've got what, one or two years left? Some hope you are."

That guy whose hair stood out shook his head, "Dunno why Vandham wasted that power on you... What was he thinking?"

Mio was feeling miserable with their comments. Taion wasn't giving in the fight, "**Whats your problem?! Mind your manners!**"

Monica stepped forward as the mediator, stopped beside the other group, facing the group, "Lemme introduce ya. These were our Ouroboros candidates. They trained relentlessly to fight against Moebius... Each and every one of them. That includes Shania there." Noah turned to look at Shania to his left, and she turned to face away from them.

"Candidates?" 

Another guy from the group of 5: "You happy? That you _stole_ Ouroboros from us?"

The group gasped, but they understood why the sourness and bitterness in their tone. 

Monica put an end to the spitting back and forth, "**All right, that's enough.** Whatever the reason, the old man did choose 'em. To be fair, they have gone against quite a few Moebius already. They're the real thing all right. You heard Shania's reports."

Taion caught the words, "What reports?"

"I had her monitor your actions with extreme scrutiny. All the way from the valley."

Noah: "Huh?" 

Sena turned to Shania, "Since way back then...?" They never noticed. 

Shania: "Heh." She wasn't happy, her nose pointed up high. 

Monica continued to persuade the five, "Together, we are united in our cause."

One of the woman voiced out, "Ms. Vandham..."

The guy whom sniped at them about stealing conceded, "Uh... All right then." Though, that doesn't mean they're happy, and not watching means not evoking any means of fighting, hence he lead the way for the group to exit the scene, to stay away from viewing them. Monica watched them leave. That guy peered through his shoulder once more on the group without stopping a bit. Noah could only breathed out air. 

Monica now turned to the group, "Please, it's not their fault. They're not a bad lot, really."

Lanz gritted his teeth, his temper easily ignited, "That's easy for you to say..." 

Eunie wasn't looking very easy to put it down, either. Folded her arms, she added, "Well, that was awkward as all ash."

Then, Shania just walked away as Noah and Mio look. Looks like she continued leading her way, and so the others followed. 

---

Noah fall back to side with Monica. He had more questions for her, "You, uh... You said that you were monitoring us earlier. So is that why? Why you stormed the Castle?"

"After the Ouroboros Stone activated, Shania relayed the info straight back to us. So I'd been looking for a chance to contact you."

"Oh, really?"

"We reckoned that you would just head straight here... What we did not expect was for you to dive straight into the heart of the enemy's base."

"Ah..."

Raising her voice, perhaps to let the whole group hearing it, "I was flipping out. Your actions were _so_ reckless. I started to wonder if our 'saviors' were just a buncha ravin' lunatics. It kinda looked that way."

Mio spoke from over her shoulder, "That's a little..." 

Sena finished her sentence, "Too harsh..."

"Heheh, sorry... Poor choice of words. How about 'hotheads'?"

Eunie: "Yeah, that's not a lot better..." The group was currently descending a red ramp, towards a green-lit area (the end of the ramp). 

"Still, it helped us complete one of our primary objectives: Securing a number of growth modules."

Noah: "What are those?"

"I'll show you. You'll find it quite interesting. It's the very reason why we fight."

---

The group stopped by the 'edge' of the city, looking over the fences in a row. There was a huge glass window installed on the ground so they could look down the sword. Though, they couldn't look all the way down, probably the sword's hilt guard: an icy land not far below littered with corpses. 

Monica: "We're now more or less above the sword's hilt guard. Even this place was once ravaged by war. By Keves and Agnus."

Taion questioned, "Has the war really spread this far...?"

Mio commented, "There's even more... More husks underneath..."

Eunie looked with her eyes jittering. Her left hand shuddered uncontrollably, which she tried to press down with her right. Taion, a step behind everyone else, managed to notice her outraging emotions. She'd held her teeth gritted, not to make a sound. Suddenly, she felt something warm on her hand. Looking down, Sena put one of her hand over hers. Eunie turned to her, "Ah... Thanks..." Sena nodded back lightly. 

Monica continued, "This right here is what the world is really like. Designed to keep us shackled." By now, Eunie had calmed down, putting her hands back to her side, and Sena turned her direction towards the husks. 

Noah: "Keep us shackled...?" The group reminisced for a moment with the ancient husks. 

---

The group descended to another place; a double-door slid open. The group entered the room. Mio first saw to her left, gasped, "Aren't those..."

Noah finished her sentence, "Cradles!" The group stopped and look in her direction. Rows and columns of cylinders, each with lots of orange pods; that's where they put those raided from Keves Castle throne room. They were behind glass windows. 

Monica sounded from behind, "Your so-called 'cradles' are the growth modules that birthed you. You were conscripted from birth, trained to kill one another ruthlessly, and steal each other's life. That life energy pours into the Flame Clocks, becoming the fuel that feeds Moebius." Noah gasped at the truth. 

Monica continued, "In order for Moebius to exist, they must continue to claim life energy. And these 'cradles' right here... They're used to recycle your lives." Ethel's pod was inside one of them. A transporting ship/levnis just drove away after finishing its job. 

Noah: "Ethel..."

"Yeah... You live your lives in servitude so that Moebius can exist. And even in death, there's no release. You'll just keep getting recycled."

Mio turned to her, "No way..."

Monica joined eyes with her, "There's your shackles." The group stopped to look at her for a moment. She let the group digested in that window, then look away, continued, "Soldiers bound by Moebius's shackles are destined only for mutual destruction. Those who lose their lives in battle, they're reborn anew... They wake from a Castle cradle, a blank slate without a scrap of their former memories."

Eunie: "Wait... Then... that husk I saw..." Her tone lower and lower; she was recalling the husk she saw on the old battlefield, the fallen of the Golden Clock. 

Monica didn't wait long before continuing, "But... if we keep our lives bound to the bodies, as we're doing here, they're of no use to them. This way, we can whittle away at their power..."

Noah: "So you've been doing this... over and over again, then?"

"That's right. You don't wanna know for how long, believe me. And yet... The price we pay to take down just a handful of Moebius... is immeasurable." She closed her eyes to remember the loss. Noah clenched his fist at her words. She continued, facing them whom had their eyes on her, "The City's residents? We're all descendants of the first Ouroboros."

Mio: "The first Ouroboros?!"

Taion had heard the words a lot of time, still hadn't had a definition: "What's a 'descendant'?"

Monica: "Er... Right. That's not a word you'd have any use for either, I suppose. Better to see for yourselves. Come, I'll show you." She lead the way out, Shania followed immediately. The group slowly took steps. 

---

Arriving at the hospital. Pregnant woman sitting on the benches, the guys standing up chatting to them. Another husband held her wife as she walked with care. The group looked around in awed. Never seen a pot belly before, eh?

Mio: "Where are we?"

Monica: "This is a maternity ward." She stopped with Shania and turned to her. 

"'Maternity'?"

Two guys chatting heard them talking. One with gray hair, panda eyes -- probably didn't sleep well for decades. He had some tools attached to his pockets. He also wore black gloves. Another young guy of brown hair, smooth shiny jacket, wearing a watch. 

Monica nudged to the older guy, "Doctor. May I?" The doctor turned to the young lad and asked for permission. He nodded, and the doctor nodded back. That's solved. Monica turned to the group and asked them to wait. She walked in and closed the door behind. Noah turned to Mio, the others looked at each other, not sure what had happened. 

Meanwhile, Noah, Eunie, and Lanz chatted in a subgroup, Taion and Sena in one, Riku and Manana another, Mio kept observing the surrounding area. Then, the door was opened by Monica, their attention returned to her. "Come."

Inside, the doctor pushed the green curtains away. A baby crying. Mio gasped at seeing a newborn. The lad speaking to the doctor just now stood beside his wife, whom held the baby by her hands, lying on the bad. And let's ignore the cliché monitoring and other equipment. 

The man took a few steps forward, asked the group to come forward to have a closer look. The group looked to Monica for permission, to which she nodded.{{footnote: One can't hold this back, but thought it would affect the mood of the main story so...: Shania kept showing her ugly dull face all the time, very, very sad, very, very depressed.}} 

Riku and Manana first entered, while Mio first took small steps forward, and the others slowly followed. They surrounded the woman. 

Taion commented, "It's so... small..."

Sena, overwhelmed in her tone, "It's a little... person!" 

Mio bent forward to take a closer look. 

Riku: "It so teensy-tiny, but it move!"

Manana: "Much rejoicing!"

"Uh..." Mio was unsure what to do, seeing him/her cry...

Then, the woman called out, "It's OK to touch her." She encouraged Mio. "Gently now..." 

As she put the back of her fingers by her head, she felt the warmth and love never before felt. Then, she put her hands to hold her by her head, gently caressing her, "She's so warm..."

"Place... one finger." The woman showed her pinky, to which Mio followed, "in her palm." The baby seemed to stop crying. Mio slowly lowered her finger into her palm, and the baby unconsciously grab it, giggle as she does. Mio gasped at what she felt, the connection. 

Her tone flushed with excitement, "Hey, Sena... Look at this! You need to try it too!" 

"Hoooooo..." That raised Taion's curiosity to his maximum. He kept changing location, peering over Sena's right shoulder, to her left shoulder, as he tried to get a better look while Sena slowly touched her.

"Whoooa, you're right! Mimi, it's incredible!"

Taion couldn't resisted it now, in a high tone, "L-let me have a turn!" He put his hands on Sena's shoulders and shoved her aside. With shaky hand, Mio gave him space to do it. "Wh-! Hahahahah!" The joy and excitement he felt. The doctor and Monica mirrored his reaction. Looking to Sena, "This is... incredible, Sena!" She agreed with a smile. 

Now, Noah had a turn to have his pinky grabbed by the baby, with Mio by her side. As he felt, he turned to look at Mio, to which she returned smile. 

Monica: "Funny, right? But this is... human beings' true nature." The group turned their attention to her, for her explanation. "If you want the ins and outs, go and ask the doctor." 

The doctor humbly smiled at them, then called out, "All right then, lads and lasses. Who wants to know how babies are made?" He raised his hand. Everyone in the group raised their hands (and wings, for the Nopon) in excitement. "Hmm... Well, you're in for a surprise. **Buckle up**!" The group looked at each other. 

---

Walking out of the maternity ward. Kids were chasing after each other, passing in front of them, amidst laughters. Noah looked at them playing and laughing. In one direction where Taion and Eunie watching, a dad held one of his child high up into the air while his mum looked beside. Kids running off, heading to unknown destination. Another direction, Lanz and Sena saw older lads, their hair white/gray, or at least have wrinkles, speaking to each other as they walk. 

Noah and Mio saw a man and a woman dating each other by the bench in the park in front of them, under a tree. Then, they kissed each other. Both gasped at their actions. Tacitly, their minds joined, they turned to look at each other. Their eyes widened as they read what was on their minds, then quickly turned away at the awkwardness, nervousness, putting their hands in awkward posture. 

Monica cut in, spoke to the two, "This is how it should be. This, is human nature." She turned to the three kids speaking and laughing, "We are born defenseless, grow up, then those who find a spouse create new life together..." Then, turning to the old guy and woman, "...age, then return to the earth.{{footnote: What a coincidence, 'Earth' as in 'Earth', or just the soil?}}" 

Mio digest what information she seen today. We don't know what she thought, but it seemed positive. 

---

The group gathered by the memorial, where names of the soldiers were carved by the walls; even if their corpses weren't retrieved, they will be remembered forever for their sacrifice. There, Shania handed Monica Guernica's eyepatch. "Thank you. I mean it."

As if it's a ritual, she laid it on one of the memorial rock while Shania walked aside. The group waited while she reminisced for a moment. Then, she stood up, and Noah had a question for her, 

"Monica... What was that word you used...? 'Spouse'?"

"A partner in romance."

Mio: "Rom-?"

She looked up at the names on the rock as she continued, "The feeling of having someone very precious to you... That'd be one way of putting it." Then, she turned to the memorial rock on her right, to which the group followed glance. There was a woman slightly touching the name of her loved ones, shedding tears. Turning to another memorial rock, a man with a male child, perhaps his dad or his brother, reminiscing together. 

Monica: "You'll understand too someday." Turning to the group, she saw Mio and Noah looking at each other. She recalled how Noah unconsciously shielded Mio when the Lost Numbers surrounded them. Shaking her head, "Or... It might be that you already do." Noah and Mio don't know what to say at her words, squeezed their eyelids a little. 

The group had their final look at the various people standing in front of the memorials. Mio gasped at the scene; it had blew her mind. Maybe that's her purpose found, her legacy? Or perhaps she felt so grateful?
