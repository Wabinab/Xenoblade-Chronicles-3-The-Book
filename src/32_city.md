# Arriving at the City

(The previous not yet edited. Make sure to edit that first.)

===

The group arrived at the bottom of the great sword; at least, very near to it. There were weird plants like tall mushrooms with small 'ball/cap' on top, other are fungi, perhaps? There were taller platforms on at least to the right of their direction. The Castle were no longer seen behind them. The air was foggier; perhaps not as heavy as at the Castle, but nonetheless wasn't clear either.

The group stopped and looked up, with Eunie commenting at the scenery, "Phwoo... Well aren't you a ginormous sparker!"

Sena: "Whoa... Where's the top?!"

Noah: "We finally made it, huh..."

Taion: "Quite..."

Mio breathed out with awe, until he heard Noah, "Let's get to the base of the sword. Guernica told us to come here. There has to be something."

Lanz warned, "Be on your guard, yeah? 'Cause we've **reeealllly** been pushing our luck lately."

Eunie teased back at him, "Whoooa... That's one for the books."

"Shaddup."

Noah: "Lanz is right, though. Keep your eyes peeled." They still have some route to take.

> **Translator's note on environment:** Green fog enshrouded the environment. Pink, or reddish colored deer lurked the area of short trees with reddish leaves, and is that a lake? Floating jelly fish soared low above the ground. There was a firefly in the distance. Fungi, short or tall, shared the land with the trees. Caterpillars made it their home. Similarly for wolves and eagles. There are small patches of grass with easily-ignored flowers. This, is **Great Sword's Base**, of Cadensia Region.

Mio was daydreaming as they were approaching the base. Suddenly, she stopped and looked up. Noah, noticing her actions, queried, "What's wrong? Mio?"

"I hear... a strange sound."

"Sound?" The group waited for whatever lurking object making the sound she heard. As they kept quiet and pierced their ear, the ground started trembling. 

Taion questioned, "Wh-what is that noise?!"

Sena alerted, "Something's wrong here! **Noah**!"

Noah was keeping his eyes focused, to sense where the vibration came from. Suddenly, he looked up and saw two Lost Numbers' ships exiting their cloak, lowering themselves onto the ground before them. As the doors opened, soldiers leave the ship, running on both their flanks and kept them surrounded. The group withdrew their weapons prepared for battle. 

Eunie: "Wh-what the-? Who are they?"

Noah: "Those Levnises{{footnote: He meant the ship}}... They're the ones that attacked the Castle."

Taion already noticed, "Yes, no question."

Lanz: "Which means...?"

A woman walked towards them, with the girl that picked up Guernica's eyepatches and followed them to the hovering reefs accompanying behind as a sidekick. Both were wearing eyepatches. They stop as the older woman, the one in the lead, observed the group. 

Mio was similarly observing the 'soldiers'. The one she observed weren't drawing weapons, had his/her hands crossed, wearing a brown helmet with two holes for the eyes, the screen so dark she can't see his eyes. He wasn't doing anything to her; but Noah was upset and stood in front of Mio, to protect her. Mio eyes widened at his gesture. The woman eyes tightened at his gesture. Then, she approached them. 

Before she arrived, the brown helmet guy spoke to Noah, "Sheathe your weapons. We're not looking for a fight."

"What the-?"

Another guy to the left of the first guy explained. "We are the Lost Numbers. Sworn enemies of Moebius."

Eunie: "What?"

Taion was equally shocked, "There are others standing against Moebius?!"

Now that the woman and the girl arrived, the group turned their attention to the two, the only two that didn't wear a helmet. 

"The name's **Monica.** Monica Vandham." She wore black tight shirt that suits for fighting, perhaps fighting suit, including gauntlets and leggings. She had short hairs, and some creeks{{footnote: wrinkles}} on her eyes. The eyes had brown iris, slightly thick eyebrows and eyelashes, with average-sized ears. "The man who entrusted Ouroboros to you... I'm his daughter."

Eunie: "'Daughter'...?" She clearly hadn't heard of the phrase before, given that they are the only generations that don't need to give birth to anyone. 

Noah: "You know Guernica?"

She nodded, continued, "You're headed for the City, ain't ya?"

Mio: "How do you-?"

"That's our base of operations. Come on."

"Wha...?!" While she try to convince them, they hadn't put down their weapons. 

"**Shania**. Take point." Monica spoke to her sidekick, the girl with two pony tails, thin eye brows, large turquoise iris, and neck-long hairs on both side that covered her ears. She also wore a fighting suit, presumably a fighting suit, with dark red stripes on the edges. Oh, on their eyepatches, there was a symbol, presumably the symbol that represents the Lost Numbers, like the symbols on our flags. 

"Yeah, all right." Shania took steps towards the group, stopped just a few steps in front of them. 

Sena: "Uh?" 

She scanned the group for a second before speaking, "Stay close." Then, she turned and lead the way. Noah looked at Mio through his shoulders, and they both nodded to each other. Sheathing their weapons, the group followed Monica and Shania while the other soldiers watched them off.

Manana turned to look at the shades of red caressed by the evening sun; the group followed glance; she commented, "Levnis from earlier disappeared in sky."

Monica, now had another two helmet-soldier sidekicks, agreed, "Yep. Oh, and before we take you to the City, you have to wear these." The helmet soldiers walked up to the group and distributed them eyepatches; these without any logos on them. 

Noah: "Eyepatches?"

Pointing to her eyepatches, Monica remarked, "They're the same as the ones we wear. Put them over the eye where your Iris is." Seeing their dubious, she continued, "What? They won't hurt you." Noah turned to the group; they tacitly nodded to each other.

(After wearing their eyepatches)

Monica checked that all had wore it before she continued, "Thanks for the cooperation. We appreciate this." Noah and Mio looked at each other, still aren't sure why the eyepatches are for. Monica cared to explain, "So, I said we aren't hostile, but that might not be enough to earn your trust, I'm guessing. If it lays your fears to rest, you can treat me as your prisoner until we reach the City."

Noah was surprised at the notion, "Huh?"

Eunie seconded, "Yeah, that doesn't sound right, darlin'."

"Don't want a prisoner? Whatever, I'll be your escort then. I should point out, you won't find anyone better with a mace in the Lost Numbers."

Lanz sniped back, "Yeah, well, don't bash us about with it or anything."

"If I wanted to, then your attitude would have earned you a thrashing already." To which he just waved his hands on the air, whatever...

Then, Monica walked closer to Noah to take a closer look at him; the group wasn't sure what she's up to. Noah just turned to Mio and both nodded to each other. Monica stopped her observation, turned to Shania and spoke, "So, let's be on our way. Shania'll show you how to go."
