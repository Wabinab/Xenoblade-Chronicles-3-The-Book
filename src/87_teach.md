# More About Colony Gamma

(Still got Taion's and Guernica's haven't finished editing. Edit those first.)

===

> Unlike the others, 'Teach' is not a character that comes online. But because he's 'Teach', he 'teaches'. He's the commander of one of the two colonies that co-joined forces when taking down Guernica. It was Mio, Taion, and Sena's colony before they became Ouroboros. Taking him in lets you understand their original colony more. We have two videos associated with Teach, but we'll only write about the first. The second is more about Teach in depth, while for this, we'll introduce you to the Agnian's original colony. 

The group were walking by the red-grass place{{footnote: Where they first became Ouroboros.}} when they saw a fight in the distance between Kevesi and Agnians. Noah alerted the group, "Look!"

Sena looked closer and got nervous, "**Oh! Mimi! That's Kyrie from Colony Gamma!**"

"**What?!!**"

Eunie: "Friend of yours?"

"**Yes... But the story will have to wait.**"

Noah agreed with her, "OK! Let's give her a hand!"

---

After defeating the Kevesi, Mio questioned Kyrie, "**You OK? You're not hurt?**"

"**MI-...**"

"Kyrie?"

"**MIOOOOOO!!! You're in one piece?! Thank you so much for saving me! I'm so glad you're alive!**"

Taion calmly spoke, "Yes, yes, no need to get so excited."

"**AHHHH, I'm so sorry! I'll calm down! Deep breaths...**"

Mio: "What are you doing here, Kyrie? Colony Gamma is-"

"Oh! Well, actually..." And she looked down the bottom left. 

"... You got separated from your unit _again_?" Oops, looks like that's not the first time! 

Shamefully, "I'm so sorry! I just have no sense of direction at all!"

Sena: "Never change, Kyrie!"

At the back whom let the Agnian reunite, Noah: "She's... _interesting, isn't she?_"

Lanz thought the word not good description, "Interesting, a pain in the neck... _Same difference_, I s'pose."

Meanwhile, Kyrie noticed these Kevesi speaking, "Sooooo, Mio, those other people...?"

"Don't worry about them. They're my friends. And they helped save you."

"Ah, so they did! Thanks again, Mio." Such big hearts, or maybe, she just trusted Mio unconditionally.

Eunie: "Why 'thanks Mio'?! What are the rest of us, Armu steak?!"

Sena and Mio turned to her, while Sena explained, "Leave it, that's just Kyrie." And she just shook her head. 

Meanwhile, Kyrie was whispering, "_Mio, let's hurry back to the colony! I bet the commander will be pleased to see you too!_"

"Yeah, about that... Can I have a quick word?"

"Of course! What about?!"

"This is an odd question, but... Well. How do we look to you?"

Taion remembered, "Ah...!"

"How do you... look? Well, let me see..." She turned his head and scanned Taion, then Sena, then Manana, then back at Mio, whom had hoped for the best. "Ah-HA!"

"Hm?"

"Yep, no good at all! You can't just change your clothes as you please! That's against regulations! Hmm, but they suit you so perfectly! I mean, your off-seer outfit suited you to a T as well, but I mean..."

With her machine gun speed speaking, Mio cut her off, "_Thanks, Kyrie, that's all I needed._"

"Happy to help!"

"I just need to discuss _something_ with everyone. Mind waiting?"

"No problem!"

And they turned around and met the Kevesi waiting behind. Mio announced, "She seems in her right mind, anyway. No glowing Iris."

Sena: "Just classic Kyrie."

Taion thought more, "But does this mean we don't look like hostiles _to everyone...?_"

Noah: "Let's not worry about that for now. _What should we do with her?_"

Mio: "_That's the question._ I want to take her back to the colony if we can... But can we?"

Sena: "_We can't send her out on her own. It's dangerous, and she'd definitely get lost again..._"

Lanz: "Fine with me, but would she be OK hanging out with us Kevesi?"

Mio thought for a while, "It's possible that the commander of Colony Gamma _would_ hear us out. At least, he isn't the type to turn around and capture people without warning."

Eunie: "Can we trust him?"

Even Taion upvoted, "_Better than the Consul._ Trust me on that."

Noah: "If both of you are willing to go that far, then he seems worth meeting."

Mio: "Thank you. If anything happens, I'll do **everything** I can to keep you all safe, I promise." And she turned around and approached her after the decision's made, "Thanks for waiting. Let's go, Kyrie."

"Ready, Mio!"

---

A giant Ferronis lurched between two cliff, hands curved in a way like hugging itself, and it had a facial feature of eyes and mouth on its belly, making it look as if it was perching from the ground. Not all buildings fits inside its coverings, though. They had finally arrived at the empty-looking colony. 

Kyrie turned to Mio, "Wait here! **I'll go ahead and tell everyone!**" And before Mio could reply, she was too excitedly dashing off into the colony. 

"**No, Kyrie! Just wait-!**"

Taion already put his hand on his forehead, knowing the tragedy will happen. And it did. 

"**Hey, guys! Mio's come back! Taion and Sena, too!**" And Mio, seeing it too late, just shook her head. Nothing they could do except entering the base. 

"Welcome back!"

"We were so worried about you guys!" Agnians can be see running towards the great news bringer. And so the Agnians (including Manana) greeted each other. 

"Good job sticking it out, Sena. We were pretty sure you were dead." Said someone with a crystal horn. 

"Foots... Why do you have to be so snarky about everything?" Complaint someone with a dog paw on her face and biceps. And Sena? She just scratched her head. 

"All of you... I'm so glad you're OK." A thick gray-green hair guy wearing glasses met Taion. 

"Mio... It's been so long." A light turquoise iris girl held Mio's hands appreciatively. 

And behind were the Kevesi's. Noah was smiling. "Urg hmph..." Eunie snuffed her nose to quiet herself. 

Lanz, hearing the sound she made, looked to her in question teasingly, "Hm? Wait, are those actual tears? Eunie?"

"Hngh... Snuff it, you big dummy."

Just then, someone walked in from behind. Kyrie, standing behind Mio, saw his approach, "**Oh, there you are, Teach!**" And the rest of the Agnian formerly greeting them ran back, while Sena and Taion did the Agnian welcoming stance. Mio followed thereafter. The other soldiers stood on both side doing it too, giving a central alleyway for him to approach Mio and the others. 

Dark jacket with pointed edge at the bottom side, white boots, wearing dark blue armor, pale gray-green skin, pointed ears, beige (relatively) short hair, and small emerald iris, and something like an emerald crystal covered by a strand of hair on his right, whom welcomed Mio back. "Mio, Sena, Taion. You're... It's- wonderful to see you again."

Mio: "I'm truly sorry, Commander Teach. We never meant to-"

And he held out his palm to stop her. "The details can wait till later. I'm sure you'd appreciate a rest, no? I imagine getting here was... _by no means a simple task._ Am I right?"

"...Yes. We appreciate your concern."

Then, peering behind her shoulder, "And as for our visitors here... We can make our introductions later."

"Mm." Noah agreed. Mio peered behind to look at the Kevesi, and turn to look at Teach, haven't sensed anything not right yet. 

"Well then." And he turned around and return to his post probably. 

---

Still outside, the same location as before, after Teach and the overly-excited soldiers left. Noah: "He was kind of strange. Quiet, but I could feel something threatening in him..."

Eunie: "Yeah, are you sure about this? He didn't even question us."

Taion: "Perhaps he's already worked it out. Decided, we're not hostile."

Lanz saw the results, "Well, no one's attacked us. Which is more than we can say for... pretty much **every** other time."

Sena had a plan, "Mimi, once we're rested up, how about we tour the colony?"

"Good idea. I wanna see how everyone's doing."

Excitedly, "And we can show the Kevesi folks around while we're at it." Being a host, eh! 

Eunie: "Much obliged. We are just visitors, after all."

Taion announced, "I want to have a chat with the soldiers too. There are a couple of things I'm curious to know."

Noah: "So this is your old colony, Mio. Let's see what kind of place it is."

---

Seated at the canteen, one of the facilities not 'shielded' by the arms of the Ferronis, Sena commented, "Looks like our friends are doing just fine, Mimi."

"Seems so..." Her tone was low and down. 

Eunie: "Still, there's a lot fewer soldiers here than I expected."

"Hmm..."

Taion: "A lot of the soldiers employed on that mission haven't come back yet. No one knows what became of them."

Lanz: "The mission where we became Ouroboros, yeah?"

"_I daresay that's the one..._"

The group were looking down as the mood turned darker, and a long pause ensued, until Eunie apologized suddenly, "..._Sorry. Should've kept my mouth shut._"

Mio: "No, you didn't do anything wrong, Eunie."

Taion noticed that "_All the soldiers left in the colony are newbies, with no combat experience._ Right now, they've been ordered to stand by as a reserve force. Far from the front lines."

"A good thing, too. That's what saved Kyrie and others' lives. Plus, they didn't get to learn the truth about us, and the world... But..."

Lanz: "Ugh... It doesn't sit well with me to pretend like everything's fine, though..."

Noah thought for a while before asking, "...Mio, would you mind talking to this commander of yours, Teach?"

"About what?"

"Everything. Tell him thanks for taking us in no questions asked."

Taion: "Now look. I know I sad he was trustworthy, but-"

"No, Noah's right." Mio didn't need the 'but' to make decisions. "I was planning on telling him everything anyway, and if we're gonna talk, we may as well lay it all out sooner than later. We can't just expect people to trust us while we hide the truth like this."

Lanz: "Yeah. Makes more sense than staying and hiding."

"Hngh, Right."

Sena had her hopes high, "_The commander will understand, I know it._ He's crazy harsh, but crazy fair, too."

Eunie: "Harsh? He didn't look it."

Taion: "... Sometimes ignorance _is bliss_."

"Pfft..."

---

Inside Commander Teach's tent. He had been waiting for them. "Ah, how is everything? If you still need to rest, then-"

Mio: "Commander... there's something else, I'd like to discuss with you."

"Of course! You don't look like you've come to _just deliver a report._" Standing, up, he asked, "Then, shall we relocate? _That should be more convenient for you._"

"Yes, that would be helpful, thank you."

And he thought for a while what place would be nice. "Ah, yes. I know a good place nearby. Let's talk there."

And she took a step back, had a feeling that something **not** nice is about to happen, "**What?!**"

Taion, whom had such history too, started feeling agitated, "C-C-Commander, please! We don't need to go th-"

"It has a beautiful view, and a particular... **peacefulness** _about it._" Finish, finish! 

Sena was still losing her mind, "**How lovely! I'd love to see it!**" And Mio and Taion turned to her and gave her a wide eyes look at her innocence. 

Taion put his hand on his head, "..._This is bad._ This is all going south."

Noah and the others hadn't yet know what was about to happen to them, "It's just a change of place. I don't get what the problem is."

Mio: "Urgh... _We'll regret this._"

Teach shook his head, "I'd rather not delay, but unfortunately I have some work left to do here. Wait for me next to the training ground. I'll meet you as soon as I can."

"Urgh... Very well. We'll see you there." And she did the welcoming stance, seeing that his intention can no longer be changed. And they turned to leave. 

After they leave, he quietly spoke to the wall, "_They were outstanding soldiers._ I'd go so far as to say they were the pride of Agnus. _So, now they're traitors._ People are mysteries. You can never really understand them. Don't you agree?"

There stood the before-not-seen Consul where he faced. (S)He didn't reply. 

Teach therefore continued, "But... I'm the commander. I can't let my personal feelings get in the way of my duty. **I will deal with them**. You can leave the matter with me." And he turned away, _his eyes insistent_, "We can't afford to ignore anything that might do our very world harm."

---

After Teach finished his work, he found the chatting group by the rendezvous point. "Sorry, to have kept you waiting. So, shall we head out?"

Lanz: "Yeah! So is this 'good place' of yours far?"

"Hmmm... I'd say reasonably near. But, the road is poorly maintained and slopes a lot. It might not be an easy journey."

Shaking her head, Eunie can sensed, "Oh great, now I'm totally sold."

"It all depends on how you walk it. **Once you get the hang of it**, it's just like strolling through a field of flowers. **If you don't mind**, I can explain on the way."

Noah: "Well, in that case..."

Sena: "Sounds great!"

Taion just shook his head. And Mio repeating the important phrase the others didn't catch: "...if it's reasonably close by."

Taion: "We'd better get ready."

---

After some traveling, they reached a slope where quicksand rolled down the slope. Teach: "Right. **This**, is where it gets real. First, imagine a stake." That kept the group thinking as he continued, "The stake is hammered into the ground. **So deep**, that it becomes one, with the earth. Now take that feeling, and **that's** how you're going to take each step. Your feet, are the stakes, in this case."

Noah: "Ummmm... I guess... I...? No, I d-don't get it."

"That's all you need to know for now. You'll pick the rest up as you go."

---

Looks like they'd successfully understood his teachings! Sena still had power to walk beside Teach, and Lanz followed some distance behind, closely followed by Mio, then another distance of Eunie and Noah, and Riku and Manana. Taion dropped behind. Riku and Manana stopped and turned around, make sure that he'd catch up. 

Lanz was already panting quite badly, "Hah... Hah... Are we... Are we there yet...?"

Teach, hearing his question, stopped to answer, "About halfway now. **Not long** to go."{{footnote: LOL}}

Eunie, too tired to speak without stuttering, "We have... very different ideas... of what _'not long' means_..." And she dropped her head down. 

Sena was still energetic, "**COME ON, PEOPLE!!! This is why you need to lift more weights!**"

Teach: "Sena, you know you can't hone your endurance just by lifting weights."

"_Oh, are you sure?_"

"**_The key to training is working the whole body, rather than focusing too much on any one exercise._** I'm not sure it's not a problem now, but keep it up and you'll wear yourself out."

"Ohhhh, wow, I see!"

"_Hmm..._, not good though. **I believe I already taught you this** in the past."

"**Gah!!!** I'm... sorry..."

Lanz, teasingly, "Look at you, all calm and cool..."

"Indeed. Because I train properly." In the background, looks like there's another quicksand to get up. 

Noah: "_Hah..._ This is harder than I **expected**."

Mio turned around, "_I said_ we'd regret this." And he could just look up at the sky, thinking why the heck had they gone through this torture, now that it's too late. 

Taion, from behind, already knees on the ground, "The commander is also the colony's instructor, after all. He seems mild-mannered enough at first glance. But new recruits are... **terrified** of him. _They'd rather face a battle than his wrath._"

Noah then walked to him, "Huh... Hm? Taion, are you OK?"

Teach: "You shouldn't slack off on your training _just because you've seen real battle. **Whether you live or die on the battlefield is determined by how you face it**. That's where it ends... Excuse me. I didn't mean to lecture._"

Mio walked nearer to him to speak, "You never changed, Commander."

"_Ahhhhh, don't embarrass me._"

Noah: "You really do come across as an instructor." Taion had already got back up after recuperating. 

"Hmhmhm, I'll take that as a compliment."

"It's pretty unusual for a commander to be an instructor as well, though."

"Probably... **In my case**... Well, there's... a lot going on."

Mio: "What'd you mean by that?"

"_Just what I said._ Anyway, break time's over. Let's crack on."

Lanz just threw his hands into the air, "_Don't say_ **thaaaaatttt...**" Only Sena can catch up with him. 

---

The group reached the top of the jaw-shaped peak that stretches out into the clear blue sky. Surprisingly, at such height, grass still grows lush green.{{footnote: Alexander von Humboldt had drawn a picture with a name one forgot that shows, at different height, different plants grow; and at very tall height, due to temperature and oxygen lacking, almost no plants grow}}. 

Mio, her eyes wide opened with awe, "This is..."

Such beautiful scenery they had seldom seen. In the near distance, we saw other jaw-shaped peak and thorn-shape peaked, perhaps slightly higher than their current location. Very far away was the mountain they visited the queen, much taller than their current location. Birds flew past not far away. 

Teach: "**What do you think?** A good place, isn't it? It's peaceful, invigorating. A place to quiet your mind. Even the war between Agnus and Keves feels a world away from here, _doesn't it?_"

"Yes... it does."

He wasn't facing Mio but the scenery. "I assume you know about the state of Colony Gamma."

"Y-yes. That's actually what I wanted to-..."

"Then I can tell you that _you don't have to, Mio_."

"What do you-...?"

"_Don't you get it yet?_" And he turned around, "**I mean** that I'm going to deal with you **here** and _now_."

And Noah and Eunie and Taion immediately get defensive, with Noah shocked, "**Wha...? But you...!**"

"Purging the traitor Ouroboros from our ranks is a matter of the **highest** priority. **I am the commander of Colony Gamma**, I cannot shirk this duty. **Do you understand?**"

Eunie's voiced like biting her tongue, "What, that you lured us out here to do us in? Yeah, I'm up to speed, thanks."

"No one in the colony will learn _what you are._ **Understand that the fact I'm not doing this in public** is a sign of my respect _for you._"

Mio still tried to persuade, "But, Commander, wait! **Please, just listen-!**"

"What would be the point? Words blur truth and lies so easily."

Taion: "Commander...!"

Noah: "Ugh, we've got no choice...!" And the Kevesi already summoned their blades.

"Are you prepared? Face your deaths with honor." And he called his weapon, a stick with burning torches on both ends. 

Mio, closing her eyes, perhaps felt regret that she didn't manage to convince one whom she thought would had least listen to her, finally summoned her blades, followed by Sena and Taion. 

"The time has come."

---

After some battling, Lanz complaint, "Spark's sake! We can't take him down and he's just- one- guy?"

Taion: "I knew he had stamina, but **this is**...!"

"You too display impressive power. **But it's that power which is the cause of everything that's gone wrong**, threatening the lives of others _as well as yourselves._"

Mio sheathed her blade as she tried to continued her convincing, "N-no, you've got it wrong! We-!"

"**No. This isn't just something that only concerns you.**" And he also sheathed his blade. Is the fight going to continue? And he turned around to look at the world, the direction of the great sword, "**This power is a** maelstrom that **surrounds the world. A maelstrom, eventually becomes a raging torrent that swallows lives with-out mercy.**" Turning back to them, "**If you really know what's going on in Colony Gamma**, then you _must_ understand _this_."

"**That's...**"

"**So, tell me,** Mio. Was it the power of becoming an Ouroboros that drove you to the other side? **Were you reduced to merely one part of a maelstrom?**"

"**No, you're wrong!**"

"**And what precisely am I wrong a-bout?**"

"**We became Ouroboros by** pure chance. **But we thought that with such power we'd be able to do more.**"

"**Hah!** Do what?"

"**Keep the world alive. Find new ways to use our lives for-... I don't know. I can't** put it into words. **But that's what we want to use it for. That's all I'm sure of.**"

And he shook his head. You don't even know what you're talking about except "**Very pretty words.**"

"We can only... we can only go forward. We want to find a way that doesn't involve _sacrificing lives._" Now, seeing the fight isn't continuing, the others finally sheathed their blades. 

"..."

"Hurrr...."

"Hrr... Looks like I've misjudged."

"What?"

"**Well**, you've heard for yourself. I- don't- believe they are traitors. **In my capacity as commander**, I judge them **not** deserving of death. Are you in **agreement**, Consul?"

Noah: "The Consul's here?" And he/she teleported in from behind, making a teleporting sound that attracted the group's attention. 

Sena: "**AHHHH!!!**"

Lanz: "So this is where you were hiding!"

And he, consul G, just folded his arms, "What a _lovely fiction_. **Bravo**. The fact _remains_, Ouroboros will destroy the world."

Teach: "But that's just **one** possibility. Still, people **can** change. I **choose** to believe them."

"Like the old you...?"

And his head dropped. "_Yes._ I had no will, no resolution. _Only shame._ But they aren't me. They will walk a different path."

"You, shall persist, no matter what?"

"You gave me a chance to fix it. I have an obligation. _So let's stop doing things your way. Let's end that here._"

"...Very well. Then I shall make **you** and the traitors **recant** your folly." And he transformed, "...with the power of Moebius!"

Teach walked in front to do the fighting, Mio calling out, "Commander...!"

He therefore said, "Right, you lot. **Time to walk the walk. Prove that this power leads to light!**"

 And after a short pause, "**We will!**" And they summoned their blades to join the fight.
